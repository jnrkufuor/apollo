Bengio is expected to lead a new AI research unit at Apple under John Giannandrea, senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy, two people familiar with the matter said. Giannandrea joined Apple in 2018 after spending about eight years at Google.

Bengio who left Google last week after about 14 years said last month he was pursuing ""other exciting opportunities"".

His decision followed Google's firings of fellow scientists Margaret Mitchell for taking company data and Timnit Gebru after an offer to resign. Mitchell and Gebru had co-led a team researching ethics issues in AI, and had voiced concern about Google's workplace diversity and approach to reviewing research. Bengio had expressed support for the pair. read more

As one of the early leaders of the Google Brain research team, Bengio advanced the ""deep learning"" algorithms that underpin today's AI systems for analyzing images, speech and other data."

2,Tesla's Musk Responds To Wave Of New Electric Vehicle ...,Benzinga,1 hour ago,2021-05-03 19:30:03.358825,"(NASDAQ: AAPL) has long been speculated to make an announcement in this regard, and there were even rumors of partnerships with contract manufacturers ...",https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/05/20917148/teslas-musk-responds-to-wave-of-new-electric-vehicle-manufacturers-prototype-easy-production-hard,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk invariably makes a stir with his tweets, which more often than not are cryptic.

Musk offered a direct response Monday to an observation by a Twitter user about competition heating up in electric vehicle manufacturing.

What Happened: The Twitter user referred to several tech companies making a beeline for EV manufacturing, and Musk's response was plain and logical:

Why It's Important: Most analysts suggest the market for EVs is likely to grow exponentially as EV penetration increases from its current single-digit percentage.

Related Link: Where Are Tesla's Profits Coming From? (Hint: It's Not Cars)

With EV manufacturing now driven by technology that is involved in batteries and accompanying charging infrastructure and autonomous driver assistance systems, several tech companies have also announced plans to enter the market.

Tech giant Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has long been speculated to make an announcement in this regard, and there were even rumors of partnerships with contract manufacturers and traditional automakers.

Cupertino hasn't said anything concrete about the matter.

Smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi Corporation (OTC: XIACF) confirmed its plan to enter the foray, and so did Huawei, Chinese search engine Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU) and Japanese electronics giant Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY).

Benzinga's Take: As Musk mentioned, scaling up manufacturing is a whole other ball game, especially for those companies with little experience in car manufacturing. The most prudent strategy is to tie up automakers in taking their plan forward, and go solo when they have adequate infrastructure and expertise in place.

4,Apple (AAPL) a Favorite to Win a Major Antitrust Trial Against ...,StreetInsider,2 hours ago,2021-05-03 18:30:03.372786,"Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the favorite to win the legal battle against Epic Games and therefore, defend its “golden jewel ...",https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Apple+%28AAPL%29+a+Favorite+to+Win+a+Major+Antitrust+Trial+Against+Epic+Games%2C+Wedbushs+Dan+Ives+Says/18351565.html,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the favorite to win the legal battle against Epic Games and therefore, defend its âgolden jewel App Store ecosystem.â

Apple is set to face Fortnite creator Epic Games in an antitrust trial that starts today after the video game company filed a lawsuit that could have an impact on Appleâs App Store business.

Epic Games filed the lawsuit in 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California which is focused on two of Apple practices including its requirement that virtually all third-party software for its devices have to be distributed through its App Store, and the requirement that developers use Apple's in-app purchase system, which charges fees of up to 30%.

Last year, Epic launched its own in-app payment system in Fortnite to avoid Appleâs commissions, which resulted in Apple removing Epic from its App Store. Epic does not seek financial damages but is asking the court to halt many of Appleâs practices.

In response, Epic brought a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of abusing its power of app developers by introducing requirements that affect the competition in the software market. The video game maker also initiated a public relations campaign to emphasize its allegations, all while Apple was facing scrutiny from legislators and regulators in the U.S. and other countries.

Ives weighs in and says that Epic opted for a ârisky and calculated pathâ to challenge Apple in times when the US tech giant faces scrutiny both in the US and Europe for its 30% fee structure.

âWhile Epic will play into Fortnite's massive installed base which is unrivaled and drum up support (through social media, etc), legally Apple has successfully defended its App Store moat again and again with this time being no different in our opinion. From an investor perspective, the key services business and its $65 billion+ annual revenue stream for FY21 remain what we estimate is a $1.3 trillion valuation alone for this business and key to future monetization efforts with more bundling efforts on the horizon,â Ives wrote in a memo sent to clients.

A legal battle between these two is highly-anticipated as stakes are very high for both firms. On one side, Apple has to make sure that others donât follow suit and try to break away from the highly-profitable App Store ecosystem. In this context, a negative ruling would be a âmajor gut punchâ for Apple.

âThis is a high stakes game of poker being played as Apple needs to make sure the Epic challenge, which is very timely in light of anti-trust swirls and growing opposition to Big Tech within the Beltway, does not create a ripple effect which developers and regulators globally are watching carefully. We will be watching this trial closely and the ultimate ruling likely in the next three weeks for any ripple effects that could negatively impact the App Store fee structure going forward which we view as fortress-like despite the Epic noise. A negative ruling vs. Apple would be a major gut punch to the App Store crown jewel monetization engine,â concludes Ives."

No longer is going to a physical store and browsing the aisles the only method of shopping. More browsing than ever is taking place online, more sales than ever are occurring in digital spaces and more pressure on retailers is driving change – and new challenges – that continue to alter the shopping experience.

Understanding these changes are key to creating successful customer journeys. More importantly, though, is understanding what the modern consumer seeks. A series of recent reports provide some insights into the consumer of 2021 and what they say is important to them, giving retailers and brands a road map to fulfilling consumer needs.

The Face Of The Online Consumer

In Jungle Scout's Q1 2021 Consumer Trends Report, consumers reported that free shipping was the top reason to shop online. That jumped up from the fourth spot in the Q4 report, suggesting shipping cost was less of a factor during the busy holiday season. Lower prices, which was sixth in the Q4 report, jumped up to No. 2 in Q1. Convenience was third in Q1 after topping the survey in Q4.

The report, which surveyed 1,005 U.S. consumers Jan. 26-29, 2021, found that 46% of consumers leave items in their online cart and forget about them, suggesting brands have some work to do to convert these customers.

When it comes to which online retailers are most popular, it's no surprise that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) topped the list, with 73% of respondents saying they shopped at Amazon.com at least once in the past three months. Amazon was followed by Walmart (NYSE: WMT) at 40%; eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Target (NYSE: TGT), 18% each; and Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), 10% each.

When it comes to returns, 31% of respondents said they would return a product bought from an online store. That number increased slightly, to 32% for Amazon shoppers, but both numbers remained below the 37% who said they were likely to return an item at a physical store.

Consumers looking for items often start with Amazon, with 74% of them saying that is their first online stop. Search engines were popular as well, with 65% saying that's where they start researching items. A brand or retailer's website was cited by 38% followed by social networks Facebook, 31%; YouTube, 29%; Instagram, 21%; and TikTok, 10%. (Note: Respondents could select multiple answers.)

When it comes to getting a product in a timely manner, though, the clear choice is Amazon, with 64% saying they turn to Jeff Bezo's platform.

Nearly three-quarters of consumers – 73% – believe the majority of shopping will happen online in the future and 43% said they would be fine if they never shopped in a physical store again. A full 58% of consumers shop online at least once a week if not more.

When it comes to price and shipping considerations, 68% of all consumers said they are looking online for the item with the lowest price, but 48% said they would pay more for that item if it came with faster shipping. Interestingly, of Amazon shoppers, 55% said they would pay more for faster shipping even though the company already offers free shipping for most items for Prime members.

A SOTI Bricks to Clicks report found that last-mile delivery remains the most inefficient part of the entire e-commerce supply chain for 59% of U.S. transportation and logistics companies. Yet for the consumer, that piece remains a critical part of the online buying experience.

In a survey of 6,000 consumers conducted by Arlington Research for mobile technology platform SOTI during Q4 2020, 67% of consumers said they wanted real-time visibility into the location of their Christmas gifts from the moment the online order was processed. Delays in delivery exceeding two days turned off 38% of consumers, who said they would look elsewhere for the product in those cases, and 57% said they were frustrated with the returns process for online orders.

Delivery experience management company Convey conducted its own survey on Amazon, building the results into a recent webinar, ""Amazon's Momentum and Retailer's Moment of Opportunity."" The company's survey found 6 in 10 consumers were more likely to complete a purchase if the estimated delivery date was visible in the product card prior to checkout.

""It's very much an Amazon takeaway experience,"" Carson Krieg, co-founder and head of strategic partnerships at Convey, said during the webinar.

Almost half of consumers (47%) said they would like the ability to pick up an online order at a physical store on the same day if the retailer had a store location nearby. That theme came through in the SOTI report as well.

""When they are under pressure, whether online or in-store, customers want a high-quality and tailored experience,"" the SOTI report said. ""But they also want maximum simplicity and convenience. We can expect these trends to spill over from the holiday experience into the rest of the year.""

The Convey survey was conducted in December 2020 at the height of the holiday shopping season and asked 1,200 consumers 15 questions. The results showed that consumers have mixed feelings about Amazon – even as the e-tail giant continues to drive supply chain innovation and alter consumer demands. While 19.9% had a ""very negative"" view of Amazon's impact on retail and another 28.6% held a negative view, 49% of shoppers said they preferred to shop with Amazon because they trusted their package would be delivered on time.

Despite the negative views of Amazon, 28% of respondents reported making at least half their purchases on Amazon.com.

Krieg said this indicates the importance of a strong fulfillment program for all brands, not just Amazon.

""2020 was a test for all retailers including Amazon,"" he said during the Convey webinar. ""Amazon had similar capacity constraints and restrictions as brick and mortar did … but what did they do is they hired workers … and they made the tough decision to turn off their FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) program.""

Throughout the Convey survey, the theme of cost and shipping continued to appear. Respondents said they would choose Amazon over a smaller retailer due to cost of items, with 33.7% saying items were more expensive at the other retailers. Additionally, 23.3% said shipping was either more expensive or wasn't free at the smaller businesses, while 22.1% said shipping was going to take longer.

""Some consumers were willing to wait longer for shipping … if it's free,"" Krieg noted.

Amazon Prime members were also more likely to be wealthier shoppers. According to Convey's data, of those with household incomes above $75,000 per year, 41% bought half of their goods from Amazon, and the shipping experience was ""very important"" for 64% of them. Even though 33% of these shoppers shopped exclusively at Amazon for the holidays, 24% said Amazon was having a negative impact on retailers.

Krieg said the lessons learned from the Convey surveys are clear: Brands not selling on Amazon need to step up their delivery games.

Amazon is now fulfilling more than 50% of its package deliveries, Krieg said, and while ""a lot of retailers are not going to have the scale to do that,"" the benefits Amazon has gained from it are clear – and they are pushing others to match it.

""Two-thirds of the country (68%) is saying that if you screw up the first [delivery], we're not going to give you another shot,"" Krieg said.

What Can Retailers Do?

Krieg advised retailers to offer in-store and curbside pickup where possible and be proactive with communications to customers.

""You can be brand forward and capitalize on the opportunity by sending more alerts around certain shipments,"" Krieg said, noting that packages delayed by weather or traffic can be alerts. The more touch points with the customer, the better, he added.

Bringing all communications and data streams – from distribution centers to delivery networks to stores – into a single silo helps this process.

Krieg also said to be vocal about sustainability efforts. He noted that 30% of consumers under the age of 30 believe Amazon is harmful for the environment, and sales of sustainably marketed products grow at 5.6 times the rate of conventional products, according to the Boston Consulting Group.

Show how you are reducing waste by being more efficient through shorter supply chains that reduce emissions or result in less food waste; spotlight how slower – and cheaper – shipping methods can be a sustainable choice, he said.

""The consumer base will pay more for these goods,"" Krieg said.

Shash Anand, vice president of product strategy for SOTI, said that technology offers retailers a pathway to both better shipping experiences and increased trust surrounding the entire purchase.

""Almost half of consumers abandoned online purchase because they didn't trust the site [would secure their data],"" Anand said, noting that 57% were more trusting of well-known brands.

SOTI provides technology that helps protect data privacy as well as improves the shipping process, including returns.

""Delivery [and returns] is not only an option but a must,"" Anand said. ""Sixty-three percent of consumers would like the returns process to be easier if not automated [entirely]. This is an opportunity for retailers to perfect their game.""

Anand said retailers should evaluate technologies and look to use cases that will show how the technology works in real-world applications. This can include mobile devices, RFID, scanners, wearables and drones.

""There are many companies that have gotten this right and they are doing extremely well and thriving in this economy,"" he said.

Technology deployment should take into consideration customer privacy and speed of delivery – and shipment tracking is a must-have that customers have come to expect. Anand said retailers need to become technology companies since the customer journey now includes the shopping experience, the payment experience and the delivery experience. Falling down in any one area can drive a customer away forever.
