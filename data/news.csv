(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) Chairman Warren Buffett praised and compared Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook’s managerial skills with the iPhone maker's co-founder Steve Jobs during the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s annual general meeting on Saturday.

What Happened: Buffett was responding to a query on why Berkshire last year sold some of the common stock it owned in Apple, a move the investor saw as counterintuitive — considering, the company counts the stock as its fourth jewel.

Buffett admitted that selling some Apple stock last year was a mistake and elaborated his take on the company and its current CEO.

“Tim Cook was under-appreciated for a while. He’s one of the best managers in the world, and I’ve seen a lot of managers. And he’s got a product that people absolutely love,” Buffett told investors.

“He has handled that business so well. He couldn’t do what Steve Jobs, obviously, could do — in terms of creation. But, Jobs couldn’t do a lot that Tim Cook has done in many respects.”

Why It Matters: Berkshire Hathaway owns a 5.3% stake, valued at $117 billion, in the iPhone maker, according to the company’s annual report for the fiscal year ended December 2020.

The Cupertino-based tech giant was valued at $350 billion at the time its co-founder Steve Jobs died in 2011. The company has grown into a $2.21 trillion behemoth nearly a decade later under Cook’s aegis, who will complete a decade at the company as its CEO.

Apple became the first company to hit the $2 trillion valuation milestone and Cook officially joined the billionaire club last year.

Cook, previously an executive at the International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM), joined Apple after a meeting with Jobs in 1998. The Apple CEO in March told People magazine that he never tried to fill Jobs' shoes. ""Not on day one and not in year 10,"" he said.

On the matter of continuing in the role of Apple CEO, Cook in an interview with the New York Times' Kara Swisher last month said he doesn't see such a date in sight but it will probably not be more than 10 years.

What Happened: The Taiwan-based company, a key chip supplier for U.S. automakers and also Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), last year could not cope with the sudden unexpected pullback in demand as the economy reopened but believes it can finally meet its clients' minimum inventory requirement in two months.

TSMC had last month, in an earnings call, said that its automotive customers can expect chip shortages to start easing next quarter but the shortages will still continue to last throughout 2021 and potentially into next year too.

Liu clarified that his latest comments shouldn't be interpreted to mean that the chip shortage could end by June. ""There's a time lag,"" the TSMC CEO said in the interview with CBS's 60 Minutes. ""In car chips particularly, the supply chain is long and complex. The supply takes about seven to eight months.""

Why It Matters: Automakers, smartphone and appliance makers across the world have been scrambling to secure chip supplies amid a raging shortage that has forced them to halt or delay some of their production.

Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (OTC: HNHPF), another key Taiwan-based supplier — popularly known as Foxconn, in March said chip shortage will hurt 10% of its shipment and last through 2022.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTL) CEO Pat Gelsinger, too, has warned the global semiconductor chip supply shortage could stretch two more years as the ecosystem makes significant investments to finally address the crunch.

Amid the shortage, Intel has pledged to revive the semiconductor giant with a $20 billion plan to spend on new factories.

Price Action: Intel shares closed 1.29% lower at $57.53 on Friday. Apple shares closed 1.51% lower at $131.46."

Featured Article: What is diluted earnings per share (Diluted EPS)?

Bellwether stocks are considered to be leading indicators about the direction of the overall economy, a specific sector, or the broader market. They are predictive stocks in that investors can use the company’s earnings reports to gauge economic strength or weakness.The traditional definition of bellwether stocks brings to mind established, blue-chip companies. They are the home of mature brands with consumer loyalty. These may be stocks that aren’t associated with exceptional growth; some may be dividend stocks.But there’s something different about normal this time around. If it’s true (and I think it is) that the old rules no longer apply, investors need to change the way they think about bellwether stocks. Plus, let’s face it, many stocks that we might consider to be bellwether stocks have already had a bit of a vaccine rally. That means that the easy gains are gone.With that in mind, we’ve put together this special presentation that highlights seven of what may be termed the new bellwether stocks. These are stocks that investors should be paying attention to as the economy continues to reopen.One quality of many of these stocks is that they are either negative for 2021 or underperforming the broader market. And that means that they are likely to have a strong upside as the economy grows."

Should You Go With High Insider Ownership?

Many value investors look for stocks with a high percent of insider ownership, under the theory that when management are shareholders, they will act in its own self interest, and create shareholder value in the long-term. This aligns the interests of shareholders with management, thus benefiting everyone. While this sounds great in theory, high insider ownership can actually lead to the opposite result, a management team that is unaccountable because they can keep their jobs under almost any circumstance.

The RSI is characterized as a momentum oscillator, evaluating the speed and scale of directional price shifts. The momentum exemplifies both rising and falling rates of the Price in the stock market. Using RSI, you can calculate momentum as the percentage of elevated closes to reduced closes. But if the stocks have experienced optimistic changes rapidly, then it might have an increased RSI than stocks. So, it might cause negative changes in the market.

The RSI index is largely used by traders on a 14-day time period and is evaluated on a range from 0 to 100, along with both high and low volumes marked at 70 and 30, correspondingly. Both the shorter and longer timeframes are used by the traders for shorter and longer purposes. It further adds high and low ranges like from 80 to 20 and from 90 to 10. This trend takes place less repeatedly.

However, it represents stronger momentum in the market. In the meantime, the Accenture plc’s 14-day RSI was settled at 52.16. All in all, the trends of the stock market were shifting slowly but surely.

Meanwhile, AAPL traded under umbrella of Technology sector, the stock was traded -9.39% ahead of its 52-week high and 83.96% beyond its 52-week low. So, both the price and 52-week high indicators would give you a clear-cut picture to evaluate the price direction."

6,Don't Get Caught Up In Earnings FOMO,Forbes,13 hours ago,2021-05-02 22:17:34.171478,"The daily OBV closed below its WMA on Wednesday, April 28, warning that the level of selling had increased. On Thursday, AAPL had a high of $137.07 but then ...",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2021/05/02/dont-get-caught-up-in-earnings-fomo/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Investors were quite optimistic heading into last week, as there was plenty of economic data that was expected to be strong. Tuesday’s Consumer Confidence supported the positive tone, coming in at 121.7, well above the median estimate of 113. There were no surprises from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, or from Fed Chair Powell’s news conference. But even after the GDP on Thursday came in at 6.4%, by the close on Friday many investors were disappointed with market.

Only the Dow Jones Transportation Average was substantially up, with 1.4% gains led by the airline stocks. This was much better than the 0.1% gain for the Dow Jones Utility Average.

The Nasdaq 100 was the weakest, down 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5%. The S&P 500 was essentially flat for the week, while the SPDR Gold Trust was a bit lower. For the week, there were 1761 issues advancing and 1672 issues declining on the NYSE.

Three weeks ago, I wondered whether investors had unduly optimistic expectations for this earnings season. This was due, in part, to the market's reaction to earnings reports in January. In particular, the response to Apple, Inc . (AAPL)'s earnings was enlightening. While analysts on CNBC and other stations talked up the impressive earnings, the stock action failed to deliver.

Just ahead of earnings on January 27, AAPL had a high on 1/25 of $144.87, trading above the daily starc+ band, which indicated it was in a high-risk buy area. It traded a bit above this level in after-hours trading, but then turned lower to drop 2%. By January 29, AAPL had a low of $130.02, and the volume increased as AAPL tested the starc- band.

Those who bought on the earnings were disappointed further, as AAPL had a low on March 8 of $116.21, which was a decline of 19.8% from the high. AAPL's On Balance Volume (OBV) dropped below the key support (line b) on February 17, which confirmed the downtrend.

Though the OBV was able to move back above its weighted moving average (WMA) at the end of March, the volume was not strong on April’s price rally. The OBV did not come close to the former OBV support, now resistance (line b).

In the last week’s earnings reports, Apple once again beat all earnings estimates, reporting “sales up 54% higher than last year”. The daily OBV closed below its WMA on Wednesday, April 28, warning that the level of selling had increased. On Thursday, AAPL had a high of $137.07 but then closed at $133.48. It finished the week at $131.46, down 2.13%. The close was just above the new monthly pivot for May at $130.34.

Microsoft Cor p. (MSFT) has had a different reaction to its earnings reports in 2021. After beating estimates on January 26 (point a) on an earnings-per-share (EPS) of $2.03 versus the expected $1.63, MSFT gapped higher and pushed above the daily starc+ bands for two days. After a high of $242.08, MSFT dropped to a low of $230.82, a decline of 4.6% from the post-earnings high.

MSFT rebounded quickly in February to a high on February 16 of $245.56 (point b) which was just above the monthly pivot resistance at $245.19. That was a gain of just 1.4% from the post-earnings opening price. Three days later, MSFT gapped lower and on March 4 (point c) reached a low of $224.26 dropping slightly below the monthly S1 support at $224.82.

MSFT charged higher in April, reaching a high on Tuesday (point d) of $263.19 before it reported earnings. In addition to reporting an EPS of $1.95 versus the expected $1.78, they also had a 33% rise in commercial cloud revenue. But in after-hours trading, MSFT dipped 2.6%. By Thursday, MSFT had a low of $249, which was a decline of 5.4% from the pre-earnings close.

In my analysis, I try to use a number of different analytical methods to come up with important support and resistance levels. Last week, I reviewed the yearly pivot analysis for four market tracking ETFs.

While conducting this analysis, I noticed that the yearly R1 level for MSFT (based on 2020's price action) was calculated to be $258.89. Prices were at these levels for the past few weeks (point a). This is a strong reason to regularly monitor pivot levels, and to be careful about buying a stock before or right after a very strong earnings report. Technical methods can help you further assess the risk.

Did last week’s action in the two tech giants change the overall market outlook? The stock market performance in April was positive, despite the end of the month decline in some of the tech stocks. Still, the performance was split, as noted in the table, as the Nasdaq 100 was up 5.9%, while the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) was up only 1.8%.

The Spyder Trust (SPY) made a new high Thursday at $420.72. The day-to-day action, as well as the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), still show a positive trend. The monthly pivot for May is at $412.08, while the breakout level (line a) is at $404.34. The S&P 500 A/D line made a new high on Thursday, and is well above its rising WMA—as are the majority of the A/D lines I follow. Longer-term A/D line support exists at the uptrend from February and March (line b).

For new investments in the current market, one needs to be selective, as some ETFs or stocks look positive technically, while others do not. In my view, using technical analysis rather than fundamental analysis will help keep you in the best stocks or ETFs. In addition, applying risk analysis will increase your likelihood of being profitable. As I have been mentioning for several weeks, the stock market, despite its positive trend, still has a high level of risk. A market correction of 5-10% is needed to lower the overall market risk.

7,Warren Buffett says it 'was probably a mistake' to sell nearly ...,9to5Mac,13 hours ago,2021-05-02 22:17:34.173474,"AAPL represents Berkshire's biggest common stock investment. Speaking this weekend, Buffett reiterated that he is still bullish on Apple. “The brand and the ...",https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/02/buffett-mistake-to-sell-aapl/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Back in February, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed that it sold 9.81 million shares of AAPL at the end of 2020. Speaking during the conglomerate’s annual shareholder meeting this weekend, however, Buffett acknowledged that this decision was “probably a mistake.”

In February, Buffett explained that Berkshire sold a small portion of its AAPL stake at the end of 2020, pocketing $11 billion. Because of Apple’s share buybacks, however, which reduce the total number of outstanding shares, Berkshire’s ownership of AAPL actually increased to 5.4% despite that sale. AAPL represents Berkshire’s biggest common stock investment.

Speaking this weekend, Buffett reiterated that he is still bullish on Apple.

“The brand and the product, it’s an incredible product. It’s a huge, huge bargain to people. I mean the part it plays in their lives is huge. I mean, I use it as a phone but I’m probably the only guy in the country.”

He also addressed his decision to sell those 9.81 million shares of AAPL last fall. Buffett explained that this decision was “probably a mistake,” and his Berkshire VP Charlie Munger told him just that:

“That was probably a mistake…Charlie in his usual low key way let me know he thought it was a mistake, too… It’s an extraordinary business… [Tim Cook] couldn’t do what Steve Jobs obviously could do in terms of creation, but Steve Jobs couldn’t do what Tim Cook has done in many respects.”

Munger also had some interesting comments on Robinhood, the popular investment app on iPhone:

“It’s just god awful that something like that would draw investment from civilized men and decent citizens. It’s deeply wrong. We don’t want to make our money selling things that are bad for people. But we’ve got the states doing it with the lottery…That’s one of the things that’s wrong with it. It’s getting respectable to do these things. The states are just as bad as Robinhood…The states in America replaced the mafia as the proprietor of the numbers game…They pushed the mafia aside and said, that’s our business, not yours. It doesn’t make me proud of my government.”

While talking about selling some of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock in 2020, Buffett said it was ""probably a mistake,"" with shares ...",https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/05/20906936/9-takeaways-from-berkshire-hathaways-annual-shareholder-meeting,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Warren Buffett on May 1 addressed Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B) shareholders at the annual general meeting, which was held in Los Angeles virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, was joined by his long-time business partner Charlie Munger and Berkshire's heads of insurance and non-insurance operations, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel.

Buffett and his associates spoke about the company's performance and answered questions from shareholders and others on market speculation, Apple, SPACs, Robinhood, Elon Musk, Bitcoin, the U.S. economy and other subjects.

Here are some of the key takeaways from the event.

Regarding the explosive popularity of trading apps like Robinhood, Buffett said, ""Robinhood has become a very significant part of the casino aspect of the casino group that has joined into the stock market in the last year or year and a half.""

""There's nothing illegal about it. There's nothing immoral, but I don't think you'd build a society around people doing it,"" Buffett added.

""I think the degree to which a very rich society can reward people who know how to take advantage, essentially, of the gambling instincts of the American public, the worldwide public — it's not the most admirable part of the accomplishment.""

Munger said it's ""God-awful that something like that would draw investment from civilized men and decent citizens. It's deeply wrong. We don't want to make our money selling things that are bad for people.""

While talking about tech company stocks and their growth, Munger said, ""I personally would not like to see our present giants brought down to some low level by some anti-competitive reasonings. ... I think they're a credit to the Americans, credit to our civilization.""

When asked about Berkshire's decision to invest in the oil and gas industry and queried whether we might have ""build our own unrealistic consensus on the pace of change"" to clean energy solutions, Buffett defended the company's investment in Chevron and in the industry.

""Chevron is not an evil company in the least, and I have no compunction about owning it in the least, about owning Chevron. And if we owned the entire business, I would not feel uncomfortable about being in that business.""

Talking about the Berkshire board of directors' recommendation to vote against reporting climate-related risks, Munger added, ""I don't know we know the answer to all these questions about global warming. The people who ask the questions think they know the answer. We're just more modest.""

On the outlook for fossil fuels, Buffett said, ""I would say that people that are on the extremes of both sides are a little nuts. ... I would hate to have all the hydrocarbons banned in three years… and on the other hand, what's happening [with climate change] will be adapted to over time just as we've adapted to all kinds of things.""

Talking about U.S. President Joe Biden, Buffett said, ""When I'm sitting at a Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting presumably speaking for Berkshire, I don't really like to get into political questions generally, and I don't really think I should. But I also think if somebody asked me who I voted for in the last election as a personal question — I voted for Biden. But I've never asked a single employee of ours who they voted for or anything of the sort.""

Answering a question about Biden's tax proposals, Buffett said he doesn't leave his politics at the door, but he refrains from speaking on behalf of Berkshire. ""I am not at all concerned about higher taxes,"" he added.

On this Munger slammed critics of capitalism and said that a capitalist economy has been key to American prosperity. ""I'm a little wary of just constantly being mad at people because they have a little more money,"" he said.

Munger added that he believes it's ""stupid"" for states to drive out rich people and lose out on their tax contributions.

A shareholder asked the head of Berkshire's insurance business Ajit Jain whether he would be hypothetically willing to write an insurance policy for SpaceX founder Elon Musk for his proposed colonization of Mars.

""This is an easy one. No, thank you, I'll pass,"" Jain said.

Buffett added, ""Well, I would say it would depend on the premium. And I would say that I would probably have a somewhat different rate if Elon was on board or not on board. It makes a difference if someone is asking to insure something.""

While talking about selling some of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock in 2020, Buffett said it was ""probably a mistake,"" with shares rising even further this year following the tech-led 2020 boom in the markets.

""The brand and the product — it's an incredible product,"" Buffett said of Apple. ""It is indispensable to people.""

""I sold some stock last year, although our shareholders still saw their shares go up because we repurchased shares. But that was probably a mistake.""

Berkshire owned 907,559,761 shares of Apple as of the end of December 2020 for a total market value of $120.4 billion.

Talking about special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC), Buffett said, ""The SPACs generally have to spend their money in two years, as I understand it. If you have to buy a business in two years, you put a gun to my head and said, 'You've got to buy a business in two years,' I'd buy one but it wouldn't be much of one.""

""If you're running money from somebody else and you get a fee and you get the upside and you don't have the downside, you're going to buy something,"" he added. ""And frankly we're not competitive with that. It's an exaggerated version of what we've seen in kind of a gambling-type market.""

Speaking about the S&P 500 index, Buffett said that most investors would benefit from simply purchasing an S&P 500 index fund over the long run rather than picking individual stocks, even including Berkshire Hathaway.

""I recommend the S&P 500 index fund. I've never recommended Berkshire to anybody because I don't want people to buy it because they think I'm tipping them into something. On my death there's a fund for my then-widow and 90% will go into an S&P 500 index fund,"" he said.

About index funds, Munger said, ""I personally prefer holding Berkshire to holding the market,"" he said in response to the same question. ""I'm quite comfortable holding Berkshire. I think our businesses are better than the average in the market.""

""Those who know me well are just waving the red flag to the bull. Of course, I hate the Bitcoin success. I don't welcome a currency that's so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth. Nor do I like just shuffling out a few extra billions and billions and billions of dollars to someone who just invented a new financial product out of thin air. I think I should say modestly that I think the whole damned development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization, and I'll leave the criticism to others."""
