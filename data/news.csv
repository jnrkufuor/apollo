TFI's Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the most ...",https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Apple+%28AAPL%29+Likely+to+Launch+a+Foldable+iPhone+in+2023%2C+Reliable+Apple+Analyst+Kuo+Says/18349516.html,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","TFIâs Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the most recognized Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) analysts, believes the Cupertino tech giant will launch a foldable iPhone with an 8-inch QHD+ flexible OLED display in 2023.

Based on Apple's requested capacity plan, according to Kuo, Apple may look to ship between 15 and 20 million new devices in 2023. The analyst adds that SDC will likely be the exclusive display supplier and Samsung Foundry as the exclusive DDI foundry provider.

âWe expect that the foldable iPhone will adopt TPK's silver nanowire touch solution because of its several advantages over SDC's Y-Octa technology. We believe that TPK's EPS will benefit from the iPad, Surface, and automotive products in 2021 and 2022 and grow year by year. Its business momentum will boost from 2023 onwards, thanks to the foldable iPhone's adoption of the silver nanowire,â the analyst wrote in a note sent to clients.

Apple is likely to tap into the fast-growing foldable smartphone market, which has become a âmust-have for all major smartphone brands,â according to the latest survey results from TFI.

âIf the component shortage can improve in 2H21, we estimate that the shipments of the foldable smartphone are about 2 hundred thousand, 3.2 million, 7.5 million, and 17 million units in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. In the foldable smartphone market, Samsung has more than 90% market share, and its strong promotion is critical to the fast shipment growth of the foldable smartphone market,â the analyst adds.

In addition to AAPL, Kuo expects Asian smartphone brands - Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Honor - to launch their own foldable phones later this year, or beginning of 2022. Major smartphone makers are already working on new lineups as the foldable smartphone is the next innovative selling point of high-end models after 5G.

âAt present, the product position of foldable smartphones is mainly to integrate the smartphone and tablet. But we believe that the foldable smartphone is only one of the applications of the foldable design. We predict that foldable devices will blur the product segmentations between smartphones, tablets, and laptops in the future. With its cross-product ecosystems and hardware design advantages, Apple will be the biggest winner in the new foldable device trend.â

Apple is also likely to benefit from its partnership with TPK, which has been developing silver nanowire touch technology for more than ten years and has nearly 200 patents, according to Kuo.

âApple's adoption of silver nanowire touch technology can reduce its dependence on SDC and facilitate the introduction of a second display supplier to lower the supply risk and cost. Silver nanowire is already the HomePod's touch solution. Although HomePodcan use cheaper touch technology, Apple adopts silver nanowire to master the technology at the lowest cost through small volume production,â the analyst concludes."

4,How Apple (AAPL) and 'Fortnite' Creator Epic Games Became ...,Bloomberg.com,2 hours ago,2021-05-03 12:35:18.372239,"Epic Games President Mike Capps presents Infinity Blade II at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., in 2011. Photographer: Robert Galbraith/Reuters. The ...",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-03/how-apple-aapl-and-fortnite-creator-epic-games-became-bitter-enemies,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","In 2011, when Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook wanted to show off the first major product under his leadership—the iPhone 4S—the company invited Epic Games onto the stage. Mike Capps, Epic Games Inc.’s president at the time, made a quick joke about how much money his company’s games made from Apple devices. Then he helped run a demo of Infinity Blade II, designed to showcase both Epic’s new game and the power of the latest iPhone’s chip.

It was a public demonstration of a close corporate relationship that has since disintegrated. On May 3 a federal court will begin hearing arguments in a trial centered on Epic’s claims that Apple extracts money from developers by abusing its market power, and Apple’s counterclaims that Epic breached its contract. The financial stakes could extend into the billions of dollars, and the decision may have ramifications for tens of thousands of mobile developers. On April 30 the European Commission charged that Apple’s restrictions on developers had distorted the music streaming market, two years after a complaint from Spotify Technology SA raised concerns similar to those of Epic.

The Infinity Blade II presentation wasn’t an isolated incident: Epic was featured at several other Apple product launches and was often highlighted on the App Store. People with knowledge of Apple’s relationships with app makers describe its partnership with Epic as one of its closest with any developer, asking not to be named to avoid upsetting Apple. In legal documents, Apple said it spent more than $1 million marketing games for Epic, and even stationed an employee in Australia, to provide the developer with tech support when it was the middle of the night in California.

Epic engineers met frequently with teams within Apple, viewing future hardware and software releases before competitors and consulting on internal Apple projects, such as its tools that allow game developers to maximize the use of the company’s graphics chips.

The relationship began souring in 2017, when Epic released the megahit Fortnite. The game maker hired Apple engineers to work on its products and, from the perspective of some Apple employees, lost interest in helping Apple improve its general gaming software. Epic was only concerned with things that helped Fortnite,” says one person who was involved in Apple’s relationship with Epic.

From Epic’s perspective, it was Apple who stepped back from their collaboration. It also saw Apple’s tight control over its App Store as self-serving, distorting the economics of mobile apps. In 2017, Epic CEO and founder Tim Sweeney began publicly criticizing Apple’s payment system, in which the company took as much as 30% of sales and blocked many developers from using other payment methods to avoid the fee. At a conference in Germany that year, he called the cut taken by app stores as “a parasitic loss,” according to the website GamesIndustry.biz. “We should be angry about this,” he said, “and we should constantly be on the lookout for other solutions, and new ways to reach gamers.”

In January 2018, Sweeney sought a meeting with Apple to gauge the possibility of allowing Epic to open its own app market on Apple devices. Apple balked at the idea, saying that allowing outside stores would loosen the platform’s security and hinder its ability to generate revenue. Epic’s store, started later that year for games that ran on PCs and Macs, took a 12% commission and allowed developers to choose their own payment systems, terms that many developers may prefer to Apple’s.

Last year the relationship between the two companies worsened. On June 30, Sweeney wrote to top Apple executives demanding the ability to use non-Apple payment methods on iOS devices, to avoid the company’s fees. When Apple didn’t comply, Epic responded by activating its own payment system, and Apple removed Fortnite from the store.

“The two parties just had developing business objectives that over time conflicted with each other,” says Paul Swanson, partner and antitrust attorney at Holland & Hart, which is not representing either company. “At some point they could make more money by playing nice together, and then it changed.”

(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) Chairman Warren Buffett praised and compared Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook’s managerial skills with the iPhone maker's co-founder Steve Jobs during the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s annual general meeting on Saturday.

What Happened: Buffett was responding to a query on why Berkshire last year sold some of the common stock it owned in Apple, a move the investor saw as counterintuitive — considering, the company counts the stock as its fourth jewel.

Buffett admitted that selling some Apple stock last year was a mistake and elaborated his take on the company and its current CEO.

“Tim Cook was under-appreciated for a while. He’s one of the best managers in the world, and I’ve seen a lot of managers. And he’s got a product that people absolutely love,” Buffett told investors.

“He has handled that business so well. He couldn’t do what Steve Jobs, obviously, could do — in terms of creation. But, Jobs couldn’t do a lot that Tim Cook has done in many respects.”

Why It Matters: Berkshire Hathaway owns a 5.3% stake, valued at $117 billion, in the iPhone maker, according to the company’s annual report for the fiscal year ended December 2020.

The Cupertino-based tech giant was valued at $350 billion at the time its co-founder Steve Jobs died in 2011. The company has grown into a $2.21 trillion behemoth nearly a decade later under Cook’s aegis, who will complete a decade at the company as its CEO.

Apple became the first company to hit the $2 trillion valuation milestone and Cook officially joined the billionaire club last year.

Cook, previously an executive at the International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM), joined Apple after a meeting with Jobs in 1998. The Apple CEO in March told People magazine that he never tried to fill Jobs' shoes. ""Not on day one and not in year 10,"" he said.

On the matter of continuing in the role of Apple CEO, Cook in an interview with the New York Times' Kara Swisher last month said he doesn't see such a date in sight but it will probably not be more than 10 years.

In the early months of the pandemic, many people in need of elective surgeries simply did not have that option available to them. And even local pharmacies took on a new e-commerce role as curbside pickup or home delivery of prescription medication became the norm.Not surprisingly healthcare stocks were battered last year. Overall, the sector was down 11%, far below the S&P 500 Index that climbed over 15%.However, the market is always forward-looking with a particular eye towards innovation. The healthcare sector has many companies that are developing innovative approaches in areas such as gene editing. And other companies are in late-stage trials for drugs that can deliver breakthrough results for conditions that continue to plague our world.That’s the focus of this presentation.

The Average Daily Trading Volume (ADTV) demonstrates trading activity related to the liquidity of the security. When Ave Volume tends to increase, it shows enhanced liquidity.

But when Ave Volume is lower, the security will tend to be cheap as people are not as keen to purchase it. Hence, it might have an effect on the worth of the security. AAPL’s relative volume was 1.08. Relative volume is a great indicator to keep a close eye on, but like most indicators it works best in conjunction with other indicators and on different time frames.

Should You Go With High Insider Ownership?

Many value investors look for stocks with a high percent of insider ownership, under the theory that when management are shareholders, they will act in its own self interest, and create shareholder value in the long-term. This aligns the interests of shareholders with management, thus benefiting everyone. While this sounds great in theory, high insider ownership can actually lead to the opposite result, a management team that is unaccountable because they can keep their jobs under almost any circumstance.

Apple Inc.‘s shares owned by insiders remained 0.08%, whereas shares owned by institutional owners are 59.80%.

Perhaps, it is one of the most important indicators, because it is used in the technical analysis of the stock in the money market. The relative strength index (RSI) is claimed to depict the latest and past performances of the stock market, based upon the ending price volumes of the current trading period. The RSI is characterized as a momentum oscillator, evaluating the speed and scale of directional price shifts. The momentum exemplifies both rising and falling rates of the Price in the stock market. Using RSI, you can calculate momentum as the percentage of elevated closes to reduced closes. But if the stocks have experienced optimistic changes rapidly, then it might have an increased RSI than stocks. So, it might cause negative changes in the market.

The RSI index is largely used by traders on a 14-day time period and is evaluated on a range from 0 to 100, along with both high and low volumes marked at 70 and 30, correspondingly. Both the shorter and longer timeframes are used by the traders for shorter and longer purposes. It further adds high and low ranges like from 80 to 20 and from 90 to 10. This trend takes place less repeatedly.

However, it represents stronger momentum in the market. In the meantime, the Accenture plc’s 14-day RSI was settled at 52.16. All in all, the trends of the stock market were shifting slowly but surely.

Meanwhile, AAPL traded under umbrella of Technology sector, the stock was traded -9.39% ahead of its 52-week high and 83.96% beyond its 52-week low. So, both the price and 52-week high indicators would give you a clear-cut picture to evaluate the price direction."
