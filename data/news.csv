A U.S. judge on Tuesday pressed the chief executive of “Fortnite” creator Epic Games on how the fundamental changes the game maker is asking her to force on Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) App Store would affect the livelihoods of millions of developers who make software for Apple devices.

Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is presiding over a three-week trial that kicked off Monday in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. read more

Epic has alleged that Apple has abused the power it holds over the software developers who want to reach its 1 billion iPhone users by charging commissions of up to 30% on in-app purchases and conducting App Store reviews that Epic alleges hold back companies Apple views as competitors.

Epic Games Chief Executive Tim Sweeney on Monday testified that “Apple exercises total control over all software on iOS” and can deny access to apps at will. read more

Epic wants Gonzalez Rogers to order Apple to allow users to put third-party software onto their iPhones and ease its in-app payment rules. Those changes would apply to all kinds of apps, not just games like Epic’s “Fortnite.”

After Epic’s Sweeney had been further questioned by attorneys for both Epic and Apple on Tuesday, the judge asked Sweeney whether he was familiar with the economics of running other apps, such as food apps, dating apps or instant messaging apps. Sweeney said he was not.

“So you don’t have any idea how what you are asking for would impact any of the developers who engage in those other categories of apps, is that right?” Gonzalez Rogers asked.

At another point, Sweeney said users faced “friction” in making purchases in the “Fortnite” game outside of native applications.

Gonzalez Rogers asked Sweeney whether the company’s desire to be free of Apple‘s in-app purchase requirements meant that it wanted the “Fortnite” user base, which includes many younger users, to have access to “what I would call, as a parent, an impulse purchase.”

“What you are really asking for is the ability to have impulse purchases,” she said to Sweeney through layers of plexiglass separating the witness booth from the bench."

Past 5 years growth of AAPL observed at 7.30%, and for the next five years the analysts that follow this company are expecting its growth at 16.95%. The average true range (ATR) is a measure of volatility introduced by Welles Wilder in his book, “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.” The true range indicator is the greatest of the following: current high less the current low, the absolute value of the current high less the previous close and the absolute value of the current low less the previous close. The average true range is a moving average, generally 14 days, of the true ranges.

The stock has a market cap of $2259.28B with 16.75B shares outstanding, of which the float was 16.62B shares. Analysts consider this stock active, since it switched Trading volume reached 115,262,284 shares as compared to its average volume of 101.16M shares. The Average Daily Trading Volume (ADTV) demonstrates trading activity related to the liquidity of the security. When Ave Volume tends to increase, it shows enhanced liquidity.

But when Ave Volume is lower, the security will tend to be cheap as people are not as keen to purchase it. Hence, it might have an effect on the worth of the security. AAPL’s relative volume was 1.19. Relative volume is a great indicator to keep a close eye on, but like most indicators it works best in conjunction with other indicators and on different time frames. Higher relative volume you will have more liquidity in the stock which will tighten spreads and allow you to trade with more size without a ton of slippage.

Beta is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is used in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which calculates the predictable return of an asset based on its beta and predictable market returns. Beta is also known as the beta coefficient.

A beta of 1 indicates that the security’s price moves with the market. A beta of less than 1 means that the security is theoretically less volatile than the market.

The volatility value is used by the investors for various reasons and purposes in measuring the fundamental price change and the rate of variation in AAPL’s price. The ART is a specific type of indicator, which is capable of weighing up stock volatility in the financial markets effectively.

Should You Go With High Insider Ownership?

Many value investors look for stocks with a high percent of insider ownership, under the theory that when management are shareholders, they will act in its own self interest, and create shareholder value in the long-term. This aligns the interests of shareholders with management, thus benefiting everyone. While this sounds great in theory, high insider ownership can actually lead to the opposite result, a management team that is unaccountable because they can keep their jobs under almost any circumstance.

Apple Inc.‘s shares owned by insiders remained 0.08%, whereas shares owned by institutional owners are 59.80%.

Perhaps, it is one of the most important indicators, because it is used in the technical analysis of the stock in the money market. The relative strength index (RSI) is claimed to depict the latest and past performances of the stock market, based upon the ending price volumes of the current trading period. The RSI is characterized as a momentum oscillator, evaluating the speed and scale of directional price shifts. The momentum exemplifies both rising and falling rates of the Price in the stock market. Using RSI, you can calculate momentum as the percentage of elevated closes to reduced closes. But if the stocks have experienced optimistic changes rapidly, then it might have an increased RSI than stocks. So, it might cause negative changes in the market.

The RSI index is largely used by traders on a 14-day time period and is evaluated on a range from 0 to 100, along with both high and low volumes marked at 70 and 30, correspondingly. Both the shorter and longer timeframes are used by the traders for shorter and longer purposes. It further adds high and low ranges like from 80 to 20 and from 90 to 10. This trend takes place less repeatedly.

However, it represents stronger momentum in the market. In the meantime, the Accenture plc’s 14-day RSI was settled at 42.64. All in all, the trends of the stock market were shifting slowly but surely.

Meanwhile, AAPL traded under umbrella of Technology sector, the stock was traded -12.25% ahead of its 52-week high and 77.87% beyond its 52-week low. So, both the price and 52-week high indicators would give you a clear-cut picture to evaluate the price direction."

Here is what caused shares to return to correction territory this Tuesday.

It has been a tough day for Apple stock bulls. Shares of the Cupertino-based company dipped 3.6%, the stock's third worst performance since the 2020 US Presidential election and the announcement of the first COVID-19 vaccines.

The Apple Maven reviews what could have caused AAPL to spin its wheels this Tuesday. Meanwhile, Apple stock has returned to correction territory – that is, a double-digit decline from the peak.

Apple-specific matters were not all that impacted AAPL stock performance. Below are the most likely catalysts that sunk Apple shares on May 4:
• The Apple vs. Epic Games battle over the former's App Store policies rages on. Only the first two days of the antitrust trial has been left behind, in what is expected to be a multi-week saga. While the outcome is yet to be known, uncertainty alone could be a bearish force dragging Apple stock.
• If the bench trial were not enough, a long-time Wall Street bull sounded a bit less excited about the App Store. Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty saw ""softer than expected"" April App Store data, and lowered her fiscal third quarter App Store growth rate rather sharply, to 11% from 19% previously.
• Softness seems to have been widespread in the market, and not confined to Apple shares. Comments from Treasury Secretary and former Fed Chair Janet Yellen regarding the need for higher rates ""to make sure our economy doesn't overheat"" probably helped to put pressure on tech and growth stocks.

After an early April rally, Apple stock took a U-turn after fiscal second quarter earnings. Here is a refresher on some of Apple shares' key metrics:
• Flat for the year vs. the S&P 500's 12% and the Nasdaq's 7% gains.
• Down around 11% from the January peak of $143 per share.
• Worth about $2.1 trillion and, once again, at risk of dipping below the $2 trillion valuation milestone – a 6% decline from here would do the trick.

The AAPL selloff was part part of a general drop in tech stocks amidst fears of a rise in interest rates.

At one point during the day, the value of each AAPL stock had dropped about $5.30. That’s a decrease of roughly $88 billion in Apple’s $2.1 trillion market capitalization.

Knowing what causes markets to rise and fall is an arcane proposition, but The New York Times credited Tuesday’s fall of tech stocks to a comment by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that interest rates will have to increase to head off inflation later in 2021.

That apparently caused Google shares to decline 1.7%, Facebook to go down 1.3%, Amazon to decrease 2.2% and Netflix to drop 1.2%.

The iPhone-maker’s stock price has been on the rise recently, so this is not a dramatic lowering in shareholder value. The last time Apple shares were at this level was April 6, 2021 — just a month ago. That said, it didn’t get a boost last week after the company announced surprisingly good financial results for the first quarter of 2021. The stock price is down over 5% since then.

Still, anyone considering picking up some APPL might consider the shares on sale. The company has been a solid long-term buy for many years. Its stock price has gone up 930% since May 2, 2011.

Especially as Yellen has no power to affect interest rates. That’s up to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the rest of the Fed. So the tech market drop on Tuesday was a reaction to a comment from Yellen with no teeth to back it up.

“I wanted the world to see that Apple exercises total control over all software on iOS, and it can use that control to deny users’ access to apps,” Tim Sweeney said from behind layers of plexiglass in a federal courthouse in Oakland, California, on the first day of an antitrust trial against Apple.

The trial, expected to run three weeks, brings to a head a lawsuit Epic brought last year in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California that centers on two Apple practices that have become cornerstones of its business: Apple‘s requirement that virtually all third-party software for the world’s 1 billion iPhones be distributed through its App Store, and the requirement that developers use Apple‘s in-app purchase system, which charges commissions of up to 30%.

Epic broke Apple‘s rules in August when it introduced its own in-app payment system in “Fortnite” to circumvent Apple‘s commissions. In response, Apple kicked Epic off its App Store.

Epic sued Apple, alleging the iPhone maker is abusing its power over app developers with App Store review rules and payment requirements that hurt competition in the software market. Epic also launched an aggressive public relations campaign to call attention to its allegations just as Apple’s practices have come under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators in the United States and elsewhere.

In opening arguments, Epic attorney Katherine Forrest of Cravath, Swaine & Moore laid out the gaming company’s argument that Apple has “brick by brick” built its App Store into a “walled garden” meant to extract fees from developers who want to access Apple‘s 1 billion iPhone users. Forrest argued that Apple has locked those users into its ecosystem with apps like iMessage, which lets Apple users send messages to other devices but has limited functionality when communicating with Android users.

“The most prevalent flower in the walled garden is the Venus fly trap,” Forrest argued before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers.

Apple has countered Epic’s allegations by arguing its App Store rules have made consumers feel safe and secure in opening up their wallets to unknown developers, helping create a massive market from which all developers have benefited. Apple argues that Epic intentionally broke its contracts with Apple because the game maker wanted a free ride on the iPhone maker’s platform.

In opening arguments for Apple, attorney Karen Dunn of Paul, Weiss noted Epic is asking the judge to force Apple to let third-party software be installed on its phones outside the App Store, similar to the “side loading” the Android operating system already allows.

“Epic is asking for government intervention to take away a choice that consumers currently have,” Dunn told the court.

The courtroom was closed to the public, but in the audience as a “corporate witness” for each side were Epic’s Sweeney and Phil Schiller, Apple‘s App Store chief.

During his testimony, Sweeney said Epic does pay commissions to other platform owners such as Sony Group Corp’s (6758.T) PlayStation and Microsoft Corp’s ((MSFT).O) Xbox but explained that those hardware makers use fees from developers to subsidize the further development of their hardware.

Judge Gonzalez Rogers also asked her first direct questions of the trial during Sweeney’s testimony, inquiring whether Apple‘s original iPhones from 2007 and 2008 were sophisticated enough to run Epic’s video games. Sweeney said they were not.

“So Apple did have to do something to the iPhone itself in order for it to be sophisticated enough to play your software? How is that any different than consoles?” she asked.

Sweeney responded that the hardware development was similar, but the two devices had different business models.

Sweeney and Schiller are expected to attend the entire trial, which will also feature in-person testimony from Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and other senior executives at both firms.

Epic is not seeking monetary damages but is asking the court to hand down orders that would end many of Apple’s practices."
