Emily Skye, 36, has revealed some of the ‘hurtful’ messages she has received over her post-baby body.

It has been seven months since Australian fitness star Emily Skye gave birth to her second child - and after experiencing a barrage of vile comments about her post-baby body, she has an important message to share.

The Gold Coast trainer, 36, who is known for her successful online fitness program Emily Skye Fit, spoke exclusively to news.com.au about some of the ""hurtful"" messages she has been receiving since the birth of her son Izaac in June last year.

She said that while she experienced body shaming after having her eldest daughter Mia, 3, some of the things people are writing to her now are ""a lot worse"".

""If I engage, it's always kind, I'm never nasty back,"" Emily said.

""And as much as what she said was hurtful and pissed me off, I thought she must be in pain herself or something must have happened because her prior messages were nice - she would tell me I have such a lovely bond with my daughter and ask if I have had Izaac yet.""

Emily responded to the woman saying, ""I hope you are OK, sending love.""

But admittedly, she said like most people, it's never nice to receive nasty comments, especially one's about your children.

Other comments have centred around her post-baby body, with some reading: ""Yuck. Adding to list of reasons to never have Kids. RIP fit bod. Unfollowing"", to ""Well you better practice what you preach, because looking at your rig … it's not in good order to steal millions off the public … your (sic) a scab"".

She explained that despite her body naturally changing after birth, it doesn't take away from her experience and qualifications as a personal trainer.

""After I had my daughter, I had this feeling that I needed to be fit - I thought I had to look fit to be an expert in fitness, but I am still an expert because I will always have that knowledge and experience,"" she said.

Emily, who has a combined social media following of 12.5 million, said she is initially filled with anger by the harsh comments.

""I am irritated, frustrated and hurt - all those natural human responses, but then I go OK, let's take control now, I am not going to let them bring me down.""

""I practise deep breathing, it helps calm me down and I think about it; that they are coming from a place of pain and not thinking clearly.""

She purposely posts photos showing her differences, to prove no one is perfect - not even social media influencers.

And by sharing her own body shaming experience, she wants to remind women to always love themselves and not let anyone negatively influence your relationship with your body.

""I've said this before - I love my body so much and I am grateful for everything it has done for me and my kids,"" Emily said.

But it was a moment straight after giving birth to her son, when she felt the most connected and grateful for her body.

""I always used to be focused on how I looked and wanting to be lean, but now I am obsessed with my body's functions,"" Emily said.

""I made a promise to myself the day I gave birth to my son Izaac that if I were to ever have negative thoughts about my body I'd remind myself of what it's done for me and how blessed I am.""



 She said it was after she was taken to hospital following her emergency birth it was then she had a moment of realisation.

""After I took my first shower (following the birth) I looked in the mirror, held my belly and said 'thank you', you are amazing'.""

""I thought to myself if I every get those feelings and worry about things like stretch marks, I have to think about that moment and remember what it has done.

""And I have never have had to remind myself to this day.""

Part of the reason for Emily's huge success and social media following is attributed to her raw and honest posts.

In fact, for her newly created post-pregnancy program, to be released February 1, the mother-of-two recorded it in real-time with her post-pregnancy body.

""It's not a year later when I am back in shape with abs - I want people to go through my journey with me, to see I also struggle, have stretched skin and everything.""

Emily, who worked with a post-natal expert on the program, said she is really proud of it and her body in getting through the training.

It is filmed in three stages - recover, progress and rebuild and it also covers mental wellbeing, self esteem and body image expectations.

Emily has been back at training five days a week and while she said it has been challenging, particularly finding the motivation, she added that she has never felt stronger.

""I am listening to my body and understanding that it takes time - but I feel amazing and on top of the world,"" she said.",‘Nasty’ backlash to star’s gym selfie,www.dailymercury.com.au

2,3,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-9179979/Kate-Ritchies-25-year-old-rumoured-new-beau-John-Bells-brush-law-revealed.html,"Last week, photos emerged of actress Kate Ritchie holding hands with her rumoured new boyfriend John Bell.

And while little is known about John, resurfaced court records show the cyber security businessman, 25, has had a minor brush with the law.

Court extracts reveal John was charged with careless driving in March 2015, but was not convicted.

According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Bell was described as a 'messed up teenager from little old Portland [Victoria]' in an Instagram post by a friend last year.

The Home and Away star has been keeping low-key since splitting from her husband, Stuart Webb, after 10 years of marriage.

It comes as the notoriously private star sent tongues wagging about the identity of her mystery man after New Idea published photos of them on holiday together.

John has several eye-catching tattoos, including the words 'Italian Pride' on his forearm.

John started security solutions business VIREOSS in September 2019. He runs the company from the small town of Seymour, an hour and a half from Melbourne.

He made all his social media accounts private after New Idea published the photos of him holding hands with Kate.

But from what is publicly available, he seems to have a passion for travel, having visited Paris among other destinations.

He is also a fan of horse racing, with his liked pages including Racing Victoria, Flemington Racecourse, and Country Racing Victoria.

Kate and John reportedly stayed at an Airbnb and spent most of their time on holiday relaxing by their private mineral salt pool and visiting Byron Bay's top restaurants.

The sighting comes after Kate parted ways with her husband, retired rugby league player Stuart Webb, after a decade of marriage.

While it's unclear when exactly Kate and Stuart split, she hasn't worn her wedding ring in a year and moved out of their marital home in Sydney's Randwick in late 2019.

Kate moved out after police took out an interim AVO on her behalf against the former NRL star following an incident at the property.

In December 2019, Stuart's five-time drink driving history was revealed in a police fact sheet as he faced court for blowing 0.083 when he was pulled over by highway patrolmen in the city's east in March of that year.

The former couple were last spotted together in February 2020, when they celebrated their six-year-old daughter Mae's first day of school.

3,4,https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ddos-attackers-revive-old-campaigns-to-extort-ransom-a-15835,"Hackers Circle Back to Again Attack Victims Who Refused to Pay an Earlier Ransom Demand

Threat actors behind a distributed denial-of-service campaign targeted the same set of victims again after the organizations failed to pay the initial ransom, a new report by security firm Radware finds.

See Also: Live Webinar | SolarWinds Breach: If Cyber Companies Can Get Hit, Do You Stand A Chance?

The report notes the victims were first hit by the unidentified group in August or September 2020. Then, when the victims failed to pay the initial ransom demand, they were sent additional ransom extortion emails in December 2020 and January, with the threat actors demanding between five and 10 bitcoins ($160,000 and $320,000).

Soon after the victims received the second set of threatening messages, the organizations were hit with a DDoS attack that exceeded 200Gbps and lasted more than nine hours without interruption, the report notes.

""Maybe you forgot us, but we didn't forget you. We were busy working on more profitable projects, but now we are back,"" the second ransom note read, according to Radware.

Radware researchers believe the two rounds of attacks were conducted by the same threat actor due to the similarities in the attack infrastructure and the messages received from the attackers. Also, the companies that received the new letters were not revealed to the media last year, so only the original threat actors would know the organizations had been previously targeted.

Radware's researchers say the tactics recently observed with the attacks launched by this particular group indicate a fundamental change in how it operates. Previously, the operators would target a company or industry for a few weeks and then move on.

""The 2020-2021 global ransom DDoS campaign represents a strategic shift from these tactics. DDoS extortion has now become an integral part of the threat landscape for organizations across nearly every industry since the middle of 2020,"" the report states.

The other major change spotted is this threat group is no longer shy about returning to targets that initially ignored their attack or threat, with Radware saying companies that were targeted last year could expect another letter and attack in the coming months.

""We asked for 10 bitcoin to be paid at (bitcoin address) to avoid getting your whole network DDoSed. It's a long time overdue and we did not receive payment. Why? What is wrong? Do you think you can mitigate our attacks? Do you think that it was a prank or that we will just give up? In any case, you are wrong,"" the second letter says, according to Radware.

""The perseverance, size and duration of the attack makes us believe that this group has either been successful in receiving payments or they have extensive financial resources to continue their attacks,"" the report states.

Another reason Radware believes the hackers revived their past campaign is the surge in Bitcoin value. While the bitcoin price stood at $10,000 in August 2020, by the end of the year it had jumped to approximately $30,000.

Even if a second round of letters and DDoS attacks are received, Radware recommends against paying the attacker's ransom, as there is no guarantee a payment will result in the attacker abandoning their efforts.

""Knowing an organization has succumbed to the threat will lead them to circle back in the future,"" the report adds.
• Hybrid DDoS protection to include on-premises and cloud DDoS protection for real-time DDoS attack prevention that also addresses high-volume attacks and protects from pipe saturation;
• Behavioral-based detection to quickly and accurately identify and block anomalies while allowing legitimate traffic through;
• Real-time signature creation to promptly protect from unknown threats and zero-day attacks;

This month, security firm Check Point Research uncovered a new botnet dubbed FreakOut that launched DDoS attacks to target vulnerable Linux systems (see: 'FreakOut' Botnet Targets Unpatched Linux Systems).

In December, security firm Citrix warned that threat actors were taking advantage of the company's ADC products to conduct and amplify distributed denial-of-service attacks, according to a notification published by the firm (see: Citrix Warns Its ADC Products Are Being Used in DDoS Attacks).

Earlier, the FBI issued a warning that the bureau had seen a steady increase in not only the number of DDoS attacks affecting U.S. organizations, but also in the techniques used to amplify these attacks (see: FBI Alert Warns of Increase in Disruptive DDoS Attacks).",DDoS Attackers Revive Old Campaigns to Extort Ransom,www.bankinfosecurity.com
4,5,https://www.fijivillage.com/news/52-people-arrested-in-Kadavu-during-police-operations-485xrf/,"52 people have been arrested for various crime offences in Kadavu during police operations since June last year.

This was confirmed by the Kadavu Police Station Officer, Inspector Josua Daveta during a week-long specialised training and awareness program conducted by the Methodist Church at Namalata Village.

Daveta says they have noted serious crimes such as domestic violence and sexual offences have decreased and believe the decrease is due to the high number of joint drug raids conducted by officers from Suva and Kadavu.

He says 48 people were arrested during the operational period from June to December 2020 and four people have been arrested this year.

Daveta says their focus is to reduce cultivation of illicit drugs and create awareness on its harmful impacts.

He says from their outreach programs particularly in schools, they have seen how children who are in Primary Schools have either seen the drug or witnessed it in the possession of an adult.

Daveta says there is a lot of support from community leaders and they are trying their best to change the perception of Kadavu as being a red zone for drugs.

Last year, the Acting Police Commissioner Rusiate Tudravu met with the President of the Methodist Church Reverend Dr Epineri Vakadewavosa whereby discussions were held on how the Church could assist crime prevention efforts in Kadavu through the Duavata Community Policing umbrella as religion played an important role in ongoing efforts to curb the illicit drug trade.

The Church had gathered stewards from around Kadavu and conducted a series of spiritual enhancement trainings to help deliver crime prevention messages from the pulpits.",52 people arrested in Kadavu during police operations,www.fijivillage.com
5,6,https://www.srilankasource.com/news/267625551/pml-n-lambasts-imran-khan-after-un-cautions-staff,"Islamabad [Pakistan], January 24 (ANI): Pakistani Muslim League- Nawaz (PML-N) has demanded resignation from Prime Minister Imran Khan and Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, saying their ""incompetence and ego worship"" have destroyed the country's reputation as the United Nations has restricted its employees from travelling aboard any Pakistani airline, Dawn reported.

The United Nations has cautioned staff of all its agencies against using any Pakistan-registered airline, including the national flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), due to concerns about the dubious flying licences of its pilots.

PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz on Saturday lambasted the government, saying that Pakistan is paying the price for its ""historic incompetence"", Geo News reported.

""Pakistan is paying the price for this servile, historically unqualified and incompetent (government),"" she wrote on Twitter, in response to news that the United Nations has barred its employees from travelling via any Pakistan-based airlines.

""Due to the way things were handled by these novices, the country is facing embarrassment the world over. First, the PIA pilots were humiliated around the world and now the airline has fallen to such a point. Pakistan never saw such days ever,"" Maryam said.

Senior PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal on Saturday said that it was a decision that destroyed Pakistan's reputation just because of the ""incompetence and ego worship"" of the prime minister and aviation minister.

The News International reported that an advisory has been issued by the UN Security Management System (UNSMS) which states: ""Due to an ongoing investigation of the CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] Pakistan...due to dubious licences, caution is advised on the use of Pakistan-registered air operators.""According to the Pakistan daily, the UN advisory has been recommended to agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), UN High Commission for Refugees, UN Development Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and many others.

In the light of this development, that UN officials working in the country can not travel by any Pakistan-registered airline, even within Pakistan.

According to The News International, UN advisory said that the air operator information is the result of a new automated system, which is linked with the revised global air travel safety policy.

Back in December last year, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had extended a ban on Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) for three months, despite the Pakistani officials' expectations that the ban would be lifted.

The EASA had informed that the PIA that the ban would only be lifted after a safety audit of the Civil Aviation Authority, Dawn reported. The EASA had in July 2019 suspended the authorisation for PIA to operate flights in the EU member states due to safety concerns.

The suspension had come after it was revealed that the credentials of hundreds of Pakistani pilots were ""dubious"". Meanwhile, PIA has suffered a loss of billions of rupees since the suspension of flight operations to and from the European Union and the United Kingdom.

9,10,https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/russia-arrests-350-protesters-demanding-navalnys-release-573649012.html,"MOSCOW - Russian police arrested more than 3,000 people Saturday in nationwide protests demanding the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's most prominent foe, according to a group that counts political detentions.

The protests in scores of cities in temperatures as low as minus-50 C (minus-58 F) highlighted how Navalny has built influence far beyond the political and cultural centres of Moscow and St. Petersburg.

In Moscow, an estimated 15,000 demonstrators gathered in and around Pushkin Square in the city centre, where clashes with police broke out and demonstrators were roughly dragged off by helmeted riot officers to police buses and detention trucks. Some were beaten with batons.

Navalny’s wife Yulia was among those arrested.

Police eventually pushed demonstrators out of the square. Thousands then regrouped along a wide boulevard about a kilometre (half-mile) away, many of them throwing snowballs at the police before dispersing.

Some later went to protest near the jail where Navalny is held. Police made an undetermined number of arrests there.

The protests stretched across Russia’s vast territory, from the island city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk north of Japan and the eastern Siberian city of Yakutsk, where temperatures plunged to minus-50 Celsius, to Russia’s more populous European cities. Navalny and his anti-corruption campaign have built an extensive network of support despite official government repression and being routinely ignored by state media.

“The situation is getting worse and worse, it’s total lawlessness,"" said Andrei Gorkyov, a protester in Moscow. ""And if we stay silent, it will go on forever.”

The OVD-Info group, which monitors political arrests, said at least 1,167 people were detained in Moscow and more than 460 at another large demonstration in St. Petersburg.

Overall, it said 3,068 people had been arrested in some 90 cities, revising the count downward from its earlier report of 3,445. The group did not give an explanation for its revision. Russian police did not provide arrest figures.

Undeterred, Navalny's supporters called for protests again next weekend.

Navalny was arrested on Jan. 17 when he returned to Moscow from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a severe nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin and which Russian authorities deny. Authorities say his stay in Germany violated terms of a suspended sentence in a 2014 criminal conviction, while Navalny says the conviction was for made-up charges.

The 44-year-old activist is well known nationally for his reports on the corruption that has flourished under President Vladimir Putin's government.

His wide support puts the Kremlin in a strategic bind — officials are apparently unwilling to back down by letting him go free, but keeping him in custody risks more protests and criticism from the West.

In a statement, the U.S. State Department condemned “the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists this weekend in cities throughout Russia” and called on Russian authorities to immediately release Navalny and all those detained at protests.

Navalny faces a court hearing in early February to determine whether his sentence in the criminal case for fraud and money-laundering — which Navalny says was politically motivated — is converted to 3 1/2 years behind bars.

Moscow police on Thursday arrested three top Navalny associates, two of whom were later jailed for periods of nine and 10 days.

Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on Aug. 20. He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to the Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.

Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning. Russia refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned.

Last month, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as fake.

Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side for a decade, unusually durable in an opposition movement often demoralized by repressions.

He has been jailed repeatedly in connection with protests and twice was convicted of financial misdeeds in cases that he said were politically motivated. He suffered significant eye damage when an assailant threw disinfectant into his face. He was taken from jail to a hospital in 2019 with an illness that authorities said was an allergic reaction but which many suspected was a poisoning.","3,000 arrested at protests demanding Navalny's release",www.winnipegfreepress.com
10,11,https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2021/01/23/boston-globe-starting-fresh-start-initiative-as-part-of-rethinking-criminal-justice/,"It is no secret that the media has been quick to jump on stories about those accused and convicted of criminal actions. Look no further than the example of the stories about Richard Jewell, a security guard on duty at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, who was accused of planting a bomb at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park. Jewell had no role in the heinous act but his life was forever changed ... ruined. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) featured a story naming Jewell as the primary suspect in the bombing investigation based on sources ‘close to the investigation,” creating a media storm that engulfed him. Jewell was cleared but died in 2007 and authorities ultimately caught the Eric Robert Rudolph who admitted to the crime. Jewell’s estate sued the AJC but a Georgia state court upheld an earlier ruling that the storied newspaper had not ruined Jewell’s reputation but that their stories on him were just part of reporting.

The media plays a major role in how those accused or convicted of crimes are allowed to move on with their lives. There are numerous cases where the media has been on the side of prosecutors leading the charge against defendants ... Duke Lacrosse, Central Park 5, Day Care Industry Witch Hunt. The Internet has forever changed how those mistakes, crimes, and misguided public charges are memorialized through online reporting. In order to achieve a second chance at after a criminal record, stories on-line present a problem. No longer is a criminal background check a problem when looking for employment, but a simple Google (or Bing) search of a person’s name. One’s Google reputation is enough to be disqualified from an opportunity.

The Department of Justice and local authorities often initiate media coverage with press releases on arrests and convictions. Upon arrest, DOJ announces an indictment with allegations against a defendant then closes their statement with something like, “A federal criminal indictment is merely an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.” Media outlets, large and small, run with the lurid details and the allegation becomes fact. It is no wonder that in federal cases, 97% of those charged plead guilty without a trial.

Last week, the Boston Globe announced a new initiative entitled “Fresh Start” meant to allow people to ask the newspaper to update or anonymize past coverage of them online. The newspaper announced that the initiative is part of a “broader effort to rethink the Globe’s criminal justice coverage and how it affects communities of color, amid a national reckoning over racial inequity.” It sounds good, but it most certainly will come with controversy.

Major media outlets, while proclaiming journalistic independence, feed into a wider social network meant to gain hits, views, of their articles. With fewer journalists to conduct real investigative reports, outlets look to statements made through press releases, such as those from the DOJ, as a license to print whatever is alleged. More readers are drawn to sensational claims than verified facts ... newspapers know this as much as the social networks they feed. Social media is now under fire for how it prioritizes stories and determines which stories are true or false. Major news outlets should think more about their information when they go to print and should also consider whether or not something goes to print at all.

The Globe has a site where people who have appeared in their stories can request that their past be altered or erased. It states:

“Going forward, the Globe will allow all people to appeal their presence in older stories published on our websites. We’ll consider each case individually and, if warranted, take steps to update the story and protect the privacy of the individual. These steps may include republishing the story with new information or removing the story from Google searches. All final decisions will ultimately come down to the Globe’s editorial discretion.

We are not in the business of rewriting the past, but we don’t want to stand in the way of a regular person’s ability to craft their future. If you’re looking for a Fresh Start, please fill out the form below. We’ll be in touch.”

How the paper will handle these requests will be interesting. Obviously there are severe crimes that need to be preserved in order to protect the public but again the paper is determining the severity of the crime. The initiative seems to want to have goal of helping minorities who are most effected by the criminal justice system, but will the Globe choose to instead hide stories of politicians, or their children, for past indiscretions? If the program is a success, will readers choose platforms other than the Globe to look for names? It is hard to imagine that an initiative would be proclaimed a “success” if it reduces the number of readers of its articles.

While the Globe’s initiative is worthwhile, its success will depend on other outlets who follow their example. It makes one think that the Globe and other media should not be so much concerned about erasing or anonymizing past stories, but being more considerate about how their stories effect people’s lives.",Boston Globe Starting “Fresh Start” Initiative As Part Of Rethinking Criminal Justice,www.forbes.com
11,12,https://thenationonlineng.net/coronavirus-in-africa-could-reverse-30-years-of-wildlife-conservation-gains/,"Growing strains on local economies have led to concerns about food security

For wild animals in Africa on the verge of extinction and the tight knit communities who protect them, COVID-19 is a specter, disrupting a delicate balancing act of survival for both humans and endangered species. African officials and conservation experts from Kenya, Uganda and Gabon briefed members of Congress on May 12 about the growing impact of Coronavirus on protected wildlife areas.

Their overarching message: new policies must take into account both national security concerns, and sustaining livelihood in communities hardest hit by the lockdown measures.

Unless African governments can maintain strong networks of community conservation areas, supporting thousands of jobs dedicated to wildlife conservation, protected wildlife areas face a difficult road to recovery.

The fear is that Coronavirus in Africa could reverse 30 years of conservation gains, including communal conservancy programs in multiple countries.

Traditional funding and economic development in these areas will not bounce back into place overnight. We don’t yet know the lasting impact of COVID-19 on Africa’s tourism industry. Early data show the fractures in the system, but the full effect of travel bans, border closures and vacation cancelations on protected areas and the local communities co-existing with wild lands is just starting to sink in across the African continent.

The large revenue streams that supported livelihood and a stable economy were abruptly cut off in late March. No job in these areas was left unscathed.

In Namibia, 86 conservancies stand to lose nearly $11M in income from tourism operations and salaries to tourism staff living in conservancies. This means that 700 community game guards and rhino rangers, 300 conservancy support staff, and 1,175 locally-hired tourism staff members are at high risk of losing their jobs. In larger countries, the stakes are higher. In Kenya, for example, conservancies are poised to lose $120M in annual income with unfathomable consequences.

On top of losses from the tourism sector, well-intended lockdown measures in densely populated cities are exacerbating the situation in smaller rural communities.

An estimated 350 million people in Africa work in what’s known as informal employment. Social distancing and unemployment across this large segment has influenced many city-dwellers to move back to their home towns.

But with rural communities also experiencing high unemployment and severe wage cuts, people returning home will have few options available for subsistence, which raises the possibility of being lured into illegal activities such as poaching and wildlife trafficking.

Growing strains on local economies have led to concerns about food security. According to the World Economic Forum, lockdown measures have disrupted internal supply chains, halting food production. To make matters worse, huge swarms of desert locust are devastating crops in Eastern Africa, and parts of Southern Africa recovering from recent severe drought and floods – all of which makes the continent more dependent on food that is externally sourced.

The comparatively smaller number of cases in African countries is no reason to discount the abrupt economic reversals in community conservation areas.

The spread of COVID-19 is still on the rise and will continue to have broad-based impact on protected areas. There are reported outbreaks in every African country. At the time of this writing, there were 184,333 officially infected with 5,071 deaths, according to Africa CDC. South Africa has reported 48,285 confirmed cases – an increase of more than 20 percent over the past week.

Africa’s most populous nation, Nigeria, is struggling to respond to both the spread of COVID-19 and to the dramatic drop in oil prices, which has crippled its economy.

The World Health Organization has warned that hot spots in Africa could experience a second wave of Covid-19 as lockdown orders are lifted in June, and that appears to already be occurring in the Western Cape. South Africa has its largest daily increase in reported infections on June 4, with 3,267 new cases.

The World Bank has estimated that as many as 60 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty by the end of 2020. If the situation continues to deteriorate, more vulnerable communities will turn to wildlife as a source of food. Such a scenario of unrestrained consumption of bush meat raises the risk of pathogen transfer from wildlife to humans.

As the US and other countries pivot to help Africa, stimulus packages must be designed to include support for communities on the frontlines of wildlife conservation.

If we don’t act to channel aid and investment for job creation to African communities most in need, we run the risk of reversing 30 years of gains in changing behaviors toward wildlife.

African Wildlife Foundation and organizations working on the front lines and monitoring developments, have flagged sustaining land leases and providing opportunities for livelihood as critical stop gaps during and in the immediate aftermath of lockdowns.

Emergency support throughout the apex of the disease event will ensure conservation is secure for Africa’s people, economy and environment.

The US Government is no stranger to community-based conservation in Africa. It has been supporting these efforts for decades, helping to ensure that local communities benefit from wildlife conservation, which in turn incentivizes conservation efforts and helps combat threats to wildlife. This model needs a lifeline now more than ever.

COVID-19 shines a light on the fragility of wildlife conservation in Africa. With limited funding for most state-run nature agencies, there has been an over-reliance on tourism to support efforts. In the wake of the pandemic – after immediate needs are addressed – Africa has a chance to show the world how to develop a regenerative economy.

We must strive to strengthen and mainstream wildlife conservation into all sectors of the African economy in response to the pandemic to prevent future outbreaks

Countries facing limitations and resource constraints during lockdowns will be reopening economies soon, and rethinking development pathways as they do. The community development agenda in Africa agenda stands to benefit if nature is front and center, and whatever we put into these efforts now will lessen the risk of another global pandemic happening in the future.",Coronavirus in Africa could reverse 30 years of wildlife conservation gains | The Nation,thenationonlineng.net

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack was savaged over saying the Melbourne COVID-19 outbreak was linked to a Black Lives Matter rally in Melbourne....

Hamish Macdonald has spent an entire year asking the tough questions, in one of the hardest years the world has seen - and it has taken a toll.

As the host of Q&A Australia, Macdonald understands that being a political voice means there will be a lot of critics.

While chatting to Stellar, Macdonald explained how he opted out of social media completely.

“I work on a show where you’re bringing together different opinions and viewpoints, and ultimately my job as a journalist is to test those opinions no matter what they are,” the 39-year-old told the publication.

Macdonald said his role as Q&A through 2020 saw him face a record amount of abuse.

“If you’re someone who sits in the middle of those exchanges in your day job, you end up copping it from every direction. I’ve never had more abuse for the interviews I’ve conducted than I had last year,” he said.

“And the abuse has come from left-wing people who don’t like you asking difficult questions of Dan Andrews, and it’s come from people on the right who don’t like you asking difficult questions of the federal government. I’ve definitely learnt you can’t please everyone.”

Hamish Macdonald took over from Tony Jones, but he could have never guessed he would be taking over during the chaotic times of bushfires, a global pandemic, economic collapse, racial protests, an insane US presidential election and Australia’s strained relationship with China.

Macdonald credits his relationship with Jacob Fitzroy for helping him get through the past 12 months.

“I wouldn’t have been able to get through some of its challenges without him,” he said.

“He’s someone who’s loving and supportive and tolerant. My work last year has had a big impact on our life and I’m really happy to say that I think we’re in a better place every day. I think you really see the strength of someone when the chips are down. He’s always managed to make things fun and happy, and is also very clear with me when to put the phone down.”

A volunteer member of the Rural Fire Service in New South Wales (NSW) has been charged for deliberately lighting over 30 grass fires during bushfire season in late 2020.

NSW Police said in a media release that a 30-year-old man was arrested at a home in Whitton in the state’s south-central region just after 11 a.m. on Jan. 22.

A search warrant was executed at the home and police seized items of interest for forensic examination.

The arrest follows an extensive investigation by detectives from Murrumbidgee Police District who established Strike Force Rummery to look into the fires.

The man allegedly deliberately lit more than 30 separate spot fires in the Whitton area between November 2020 and January 2021.

He was taken to Griffith Police Station and charged with five counts of intentionally causing a fire and being reckless as to its spread.

On Jan. 23, he was refused bail and will appear before a judge at Wagga Wagga Local Court on Jan. 27.

The NSW Rural Fire Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The arrest comes as the NSW Rural Fire Service warned of fire danger in parts of the state in the coming days.

“Fire danger over coming days will be tempered in most areas by recent rain & moderate winds. The area of concern continues to be around the Riverina where hot, dry & windy conditions on Monday are likely to lead to severe fire danger and possible total fire bans,” the service said on Twitter on Jan. 22.

During bushfire danger periods over the summer, fire permits are required in New South Wales.

The Australian landscape is prone to fires, which can become catastrophic when conditions are ripe, as was seen during the devastating 2019-20 bushfire season.

The “Black Summer” bushfires were made possible by climatic conditions triggered by a sudden warming event in the atmosphere above Antarctica in September, which fuelled raging fires across Australia for months. In New South Wales, the fires claimed 26 lives and destroyed 2,448 homes, according to the Australian Disaster Resilience Knowledge Hub.

Nationally, over 33 lives were lost, including nine firefighters, and more than 80,000 head of livestock, and millions of native plants and animals.

Erick Contreras, 53, was laid to rest Saturday following a decorated police funeral with hundreds of officers at First Baptist Cathedral of Westbury.

Braving bitter cold, uniformed officers lined up outside the church with a pipe band and mounted officers on horseback for a detective processional as Contreras, who grew up in Uniondale, was posthumously promoted to detective first-grade, the department’s highest honor for detectives that has only other 15 other members.

Officers saluted as his coffin was taken out of the church while a trumpeter played taps, bagpipers played ""Amazing Grace"" and five police helicopters flew over the church.

""In the hours and days after September 11th, Erick didn’t think twice about responding to the World Trade Center. Like many first responders, heroes like Erick run into danger while others run away,"" said Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder. ""It’s hard to imagine after the unthinkable number of people who died that horrific day, we'd still be losing people 20 years later. But we are, and Erick was one of those first responders who suffered and others are still suffering today.""

Ryder said Contreras did not miss a day of work until he was hospitalized in December. Contreras is Nassau's 41st line-of-duty death and the seventh from 9/11-related illnesses, Ryder told about 50 masked visitors in the church, including County Executive Laura Curran and District Attorney Madeline Singas.

""During the time we may have to limit occupancy here, but we'll need many months and years to contain our grief in these pews,"" said Nassau County Chief of Detectives Keechant Sewell. ""Beyond these walls and in our hearts. Erick's memory will always be with us, just as we will always be with you.""

Sewell said Contreras ""was unfailingly a gentleman,"" whether he was offering comfort to crime victims or placing someone under arrest.

""His optimism was maddening and searching for the bright side,"" Sewell said. ""In answering every call to serve even in the darkness we’re summoned to see, the bleakness we are forced to witness, that is what compelled him to lower Manhattan almost 20 years ago.""

Family members, including Contreras’ two retired police officer brothers, described his intelligence, his sense of humor, his kind nature and love of travel, nature and generosity for people.

16,17,https://www.metro.us/bolsonaros-support-falls-sharply/,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) – Support for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has overseen the world’s second deadliest coronavirus outbreak, has fallen sharply, a Datafolha poll shows, as a brutal second wave and a lack of vaccines sour views of his far-right government.

However, despite his declining support, a majority of Brazilians are now against him being impeached, a second Datafolha poll found. Both were released late on Friday.

According to one of the polls, Bolsonaro’s administration was rated as bad or terrible by 40% of respondents, compared with 32% in an early-December survey. Just under a third of respondents rated Bolsonaro’s government as good or excellent, versus 37% in the previous poll.

The poll results are a blow for the president. The Folha de S.Paulo newspaper said they represent the biggest drop in approval since the beginning of his government in 2019.

Brazilians have grown increasingly irate at the slow pace of Brazil’s vaccine rollout, which began last weekend but remains blighted with few vaccines to inoculate the country’s 210 million people and stall a snowballing second wave.

Pot-banging protests, a hallmark of the early days of the pandemic, erupted in some cities earlier this month, and both left- and right-wing groups convened pro-impeachment marches across the country this weekend.

To make matters worse, a new virus variant has appeared in the north of the country that researchers believe has higher levels of transmissibility. Some countries have barred entry for Brazilian travelers.

Bolsonaro, a former army captain, is already under pressure for his handling of the outbreak. He has sought to minimize the gravity of the virus and even said he won’t take any COVID-19 shot, stoking growing anti-vaccine sentiment.

On Saturday, the Health Ministry said 1,202 more people had died from COVID-19, bringing total fatalities to 216,445. There have been more than 8.8 million confirmed cases.

Another Datafolha poll found that 53% of respondents are against Congress opening impeachment proceedings against the president for his handling of the pandemic, compared with 50% in a previous survey. Those favoring impeachment fell to 43% from 46% previously.

Both polls were conducted on Jan 20-21, interviewing 2,030 Brazilians, with a 2 percentage point margin of error.","Bolsonaro's support falls sharply, but a majority reject impeachment, polls show",www.metro.us

It is troubling that no conclusive results from past policies have been released publicly or shared with the industry, yet new policies continue to be imposed that have great potential to harm the industry and reduce access to the very care the article on advocates accurately portrays as crucial to New Yorkers.

Home care is the setting of choice for those needing services. Covid has shown this more acutely with residents in congregate care settings leaving to go home or wishing to do so, if only they had the appropriate resources to provide the support of the home care industry.

Data from certain counties indicates that the Covid mortality rate for home care recipients is a small fraction of what it is for nursing homes, or even private residences, and less than half of what it is for assisted living facilities. Patients do better at home.

Rather than developing and implementing policies that create obstacles and restrict access to home care, state policymakers charting a course for the future of long-term care in New York must feature home care prominently as the crown jewel of such a system.

20,21,https://cnnphilippines.com:443/business/2021/1/24/Brexit-reality-Britain-losses.html,"(CNN) — Brexit might be done and dusted, but its specter will loom over Britain for a long time yet.

For all the fanfare made when Prime Minister Boris Johnson struck a trade deal with Brussels on Christmas Eve, the inescapable reality of leaving the European Union's customs and regulatory territory has already started to bite. The fact that the deal was only agreed one week before it came into effect meant that dangerous disruption to countless businesses that relied on seamless supply chains was inevitable.

Despite Johnson's repeated claims that Brexit is a great opportunity for British exporters and would lead to some kind of revival for free trade, the reality is very different: freshly caught fish are reportedly being left to rot as exporters cannot get them to the European Union while logistics firms are skeptical that both importing and exporting is going to be viable for many businesses in the long term. Fallout from Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic is pushing the UK economy into a sharp contraction in the first quarter, according to data published Friday by IHS Markit, meaning a double-dip recession is now on the cards.

While it should be a source of embarrassment for the PM that his deal has made life very difficult for many of the industries that he has championed post-Brexit, Johnson's public statements on the matter suggest he is oblivious to the reality that many are facing.

When asked for comment on the immediate consequences of the trade barriers implemented as a result of the deal, a UK government spokesperson told CNN Business:

""From the outset we were clear that we would be leaving the customs union and single market which meant that there would be new processes after the end of the Transition Period. These were widely communicated through our public information campaign.""

The starkest example of what Brexit is doing to British business comes from Scotland's fishing industry. Despite the government's claims during Brexit negotiations that the fishing industry was very near the top of its priority list, there is a real fear that the entire industry could collapse in a matter of weeks.

""We had an entirely new system for exporters to get their heads around that hadn't been tested prior to use. The result, somewhat inevitably, was that it started going wrong straight away,"" says James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink.

""This isn't as simple as an IT glitch that needs fixing. In a matter of days, we went from being able to send fresh food to Madrid with a single cover sheet of paperwork. Now there are roughly 26 steps for each transaction.""

The real-world impact of this means that some exporters have had the European market cut off overnight. Almost every day, pictures circulate on social media of virtually empty fish markets and boats tied up. Withers has heard stories of Scottish boats sailing 48 hours to process catches in Denmark, just to get their stock into the single market. In an industry where profit margins are often thin, every hour spent working around red tape is critical to both the freshness of the product and the productivity of the business.

When pushed on the matter, Johnson has said that he thinks these are merely teething issues and not the fault of his deal or the barriers it's created. His spokesman explains that the government is providing £23 million ($31.4 million) for the industry to ease the process.

When asked specifically about the fishing industry earlier this week, Johnson once again denied that the problems facing exporters had anything to do with his deal, but instead were due to restaurants being shut because of the pandemic.

However, Withers believes that money ""will run out quickly"" and without coming to some new sort of arrangement with the European Union, ""this sort of exporting might not be sustainable"" and will ""almost certainly lead to the very people the [Prime Minister] said he was fighting for losing their jobs.""

The scenes in Scotland might not be as dramatic as the food shortages and lines of backlogged trucks that many predicted post-Brexit, but the damage is already showing up in economic data. Brexit issues are exacerbating a slowdown caused by pandemic restrictions, IHS Markit said on Friday, and lengthening suppliers' delivery times. While 33% of manufacturers reporting a drop in exports linked the decline directly to the pandemic, some 60% linked the drop to Brexit, according to IHS.

ForagePlus, a horse nutrition business based in Wales, had dozens of parcels bound for Europe returned this week due to glitches in its shipping company's new systems for processing customs information. ""It's just a shambles basically,"" ForagePlus founder Sarah Braithwaite told CNN Business, adding that it had been nearly a month since the company was able to ship anything into Europe due to the pandemic and Brexit.

There is real concern among trucking companies and logistics firms that things are going to get much worse in the coming months.

Multiple sources within the affected sectors told CNN Business that British consumers won't feel much disruption yet, as January is a typically quiet month at ports and the United Kingdom did stockpile goods to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit. But that could change as trade volumes increase over the coming months, putting border systems under additional pressure.

This could result in a gradual reduction in the variety of fresh produce available to British shoppers. According to a spokesperson for Logistics UK, ""in the short term, while supply chains sort themselves out, it may be that we return to a more seasonal approach to shopping or have a more limited range to choose from."" This could mean that after decades of fresh fruit and vegetables at all times of the year, Brits might have to start seeing strawberries as summer treat, for example.

The region where food shortages could fast become a real issue is Northern Ireland, where images of empty supermarket shelves have circulated on social media. Due to the unique position of Northern Ireland, it has split with the rest of the United Kingdom and remained inside the EU single market, making it a lot harder to import food from Great Britain. Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, said that images showing empty shelves in Northern Irish supermarkets were ""clearly a Brexit issue"" and ""part of the reality"" of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.

Trade experts are concerned about the gradual decline in EU-UK trade. ""The slow decline is in some ways more dangerous than sudden food shortages,"" says David Henig, UK director at the European Centre For International Political Economy. ""I am particularly concerned about exporters being unable to fulfill orders and losing customers or just giving up completely. The long-term message that sends could be very damaging for inward investment,"" he adds.

There are legitimate questions as to why things have been so bad, despite the United Kingdom having years to prepare for the cliff edge. ""We've known about the risks of not being prepared for five years,"" says Anna Jerzewska, founder of Trade and Borders, which assists exporters and importers across Europe.

Jerzewska says that her clients are reporting numerous complaints, but most worryingly a failure of support from the UK government to resolve their issues. ""Getting an answer to a technical question could take 48 hours, which is obviously a problem for fresh produce. People in the call centers can only really point to guidance, but the guidance isn't currently fit for purpose.""

And despite everyone involved working hard to resolve the early issues, Jerzewska fears this won't be enough to save struggling British exporters. ""At the moment it's shock, but the underlying costs are not going away. And for traders who work at thin profit margins, an extra couple of percentage points could be the end.""

Many of Johnson's Conservative lawmakers are struggling with how to reply to their constituents. ""The party gave us lines to read out when the deal came through presenting it as a huge success, but as time goes on, it's clear there's quite a lot of nasty surprises in Pandora's box,"" says one Conservative member of parliament who is not permitted to speak on-the-record about government policy outside of their brief.

Others say that small local businesses are up in arms at finding out that if they want to visit Europe to sell their goods, they might need a work permit from foreign governments or paperwork allowing them to move goods into the European Union.

There isn't much optimism that things will improve in the near future among moderate Conservatives. Many are extremely worried that the gradual decline caused by Brexit will ultimately lead to Europe trying to lure Britain's golden goose to the continent: The City of London, which hosts many of the world's biggest banks.

""Once the fog of Covid lifts, financial and professional services firms looking to expand globally will see London and realize that we have given up quite a lot of our competitive advantage,"" says the Conservative member of parliament.

The trade deal Johnson signed bizarrely didn't address either of these, despite them making up a huge part of the UK economy. Banks and traders in London are now hoping to be granted ""equivalence"" by the European Union, a designation that would allow them to continue serving EU clients with limited disruption.

""If no deal is reached on equivalence for financial services or data, that could kickstart a squeeze on the city from EU regulators and leave businesses wondering what the benefit of setting up in London is if you want to serve the European market,"" says Henig.

The European Union and United Kingdom are supposed to reach an agreement in March on financial services, but the mood music from both London and Brussels right now suggests that the United Kingdom is unlikely to be pulled back into the EU regulatory sphere any time soon.

Many Brexiteer lawmakers felt vindicated when the world didn't fall off its axis in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, as plenty of the anti-Brexiteers' worst nightmares failed to materialize. However, if the current trajectory of gradual decline continues, the slide could become uncontrollable.

Those politicians will have to explain to voters why they encouraged their prime minister to pursue such a hard Brexit despite the warnings of its consequences. They have a couple of months before things get really bad to put pressure on Johnson to start engaging with the reality of Brexit a little more.

The question that matters most to those struggling is how bad things must get before those who most vocally supported Brexit are willing to break ranks and admit the truth: that leaving the world's largest trading bloc has immediate consequences.

21,22,https://www.estevanmercury.ca/conservative-leader-erin-o-toole-defends-decision-to-back-then-oust-sloan-1.24271862,"OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says he was once willing to give his former leadership rival Derek Sloan the benefit of the doubt, but no longer.

And he dismissed the idea that kicking Sloan out of caucus this week has pitted him against one of the party's most powerful wings, social conservatives, whose support O'Toole courted directly during the leadership race last year in part by backing Sloan at the time.

In an interview with The Canadian Press, O'Toole said he didn't believe Sloan meant to be racist last year in his characterization of chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam.

That's why he opposed efforts then to kick him out of caucus, O'Toole said.

""I always will give a colleague, or anyone in Parliament, in public life, the benefit of the doubt or, you know, listen to them the first time,"" O'Toole said.

""And that was the case early on with Derek, when he said he did not mean to malign the intentions of Dr. Tam.""

But O'Toole said a ""pattern developed"" since then, and frustrations mounted that Sloan's extreme views posed an ever-present danger to the party's goal of forming government.

It all appeared to come to a head last week.

In the aftermath of riots in the U.S. led by extreme right wing supporters of now-former U.S. president Donald Trump.

O'Toole faced pressure from caucus, conservative supporters and his rivals to firmly disavow any elements of extremism in his party's ranks.

Last Sunday, O'Toole issued a statement doing just that. The next day, media organization PressProgress reported O'Toole's outrage over Sloan's leadership campaign accepting a donation from a known white nationalist.

While O'Toole moved swiftly to start the process of kicking Sloan out — getting 20 per cent of MPs on side as required by law — he insisted the demand was driven by caucus, as evidenced in the majority vote to remove him.

""The caucus was ready to make that decision and send a strong message that we are a welcoming party, we respect one another, and we respect Canadians,"" he said.

O'Toole disputed accusations from Sloan and anti-abortion groups that the decision to kick him out had nothing to do with the Ontario MP's previous statements.

In recent weeks, Sloan has been pushing to get as many socially conservative delegates as possible registered for the party's policy convention in March.

Sloan, as well as the Campaign Life Coalition and RightNow, want enough delegates in their camp so motions they support will pass, including one that would remove the existing policy stating a Conservative government would never regulate abortion.

They also want to elect a slate of directors to the party's national council to entrench their strength.

Sloan said the decision to kick him out was a kneejerk reaction to what happened in the U.S.

But he also contends the move was driven by anger from his fellow MP's unhappy to se him actively courting money and support in their ridings. He's pledged to name them so social conservatives know who is trying to silence their voices, he said.

""They think they are little petty princes ruling these fiefdoms and no one else can have a say,"" Sloan said.

O'Toole rejected the idea that Sloan's efforts amount to an attempt to take over the party, and O'Toole's own move was a bid to stop it.

""There is no such effort to the extent that Mr. Sloan is suggesting,"" he said.

Sloan had little national profile when he entered the Conservative leadership race just a few months after becoming an MP.

But early on, he garnered attention for suggesting he wasn't certain of the scientific basis for a person being LGBTQ.

From there, he quickly became well known for his often extreme social conservative views. His comments about Tam, in which he suggested her loyalty lay with China rather than Canada, sparked outrage and took criticism against him to the next level.

Last spring, in discussing the Liberal government's pandemic response and Tam's use of suspect World Health Organization data from China, Sloan provocatively asked whether Tam was working for Canada or China.

Tam was born in Hong Kong. Questioning someone's loyalty is considered a racist trope.

Sloan denied he was being racist. Still, a number of Ontario MPs — some who were supporters of leadership contender and longtime Conservative Peter MacKay — began an effort to have him removed from caucus.

O'Toole shut it down, for reasons he wouldn't divulge then, but to observers, it smacked of politics.

MacKay was running a progressive campaign. O'Toole's was aimed at the more centre right, while Sloan and Leslyn Lewis were targeting the socially conservative right.

With Sloan gone, his backers would have more likely gone to Lewis, splitting the vote on the right between her and O'Toole, giving MacKay a path to victory.

Except O'Toole backed Sloan, and would later take out social media ads hyping his decision. It was one of several steps he took to directly court Sloan's supporters, and when it came to voting time, they would ultimately help put O'Toole over the top to beat MacKay.

The way the race played out has led to questions for O'Toole ever since about how he'd balance the demands of the social conservative wing of the party with his stated intent to broaden its overall appeal.

O'Toole said he's aware people have ""trust issues"" with his party, suggesting social media contributes to the issue and noting he must break that online bubble if he hopes to see his party win.

""The Prime Minister has to try and bring the country together: the diversity of its people, its geography, its industries, and the points of view and backgrounds of everyone,"" he said of the office he hopes to hold.

""No one ever said it's easy.""

22,23,https://www.metro.us/uks-johnson-says-he-3/,"LONDON (Reuters) – British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday he looked forward to working with U.S. President Joe Biden on their shared goals, including tackling climate change.

Johnson used his first phone call with the U.S. president to welcome Biden’s announcements that the United States would rejoin the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate and the World Health Organization, and they discussed the prospects of a free trade deal.

“Great to speak to President Joe Biden this evening,” Johnson said on Twitter. “I look forward to deepening the longstanding alliance between our two countries as we drive a green and sustainable recovery from COVID-19.”

The White House said Biden and Johnson talked about cooperation, including through multilateral organizations, on curbing climate change and fighting COVID-19.

Biden also conveyed his intention to “strengthen the special relationship between our countries and revitalize transatlantic ties, underscoring the critical role of NATO to our collective defense and shared values,” the White House said in a release.

A spokeswoman for Johnson said the leaders “also discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries.” Britain left the European Union last year. Biden’s call with Johnson was his first with a European leader since taking office.

By Thursday night, 10.4 lakh vaccines had been given, the government stated.Prior to this, the fastest known rollout of Covid-19 vaccines took place in the US, which achieved a million doses in 10 days of launching the vaccination drive on December 14 last year. The UK, where inoculations began on December 8, had vaccinated around 130,000 people in the first week and had reached close to a million doses only by December 26.The rollout details in China, where 15 million doses had reportedly been administered by January 20, are not publicly available. The head of Chinese government-owned Sinopharm Group, which has developed a Covid vaccine that is being widely used, was quoted by Nature journal as saying China had achieved one million vaccinations in November itself.Globally, nearly 57m vaccine shots had been given till Thursday, with the US leading the way with 17.5m doses, followed by China (15m), the UK (5.4m), Israel (3.3m), UAE (2.3m), Germany (1.4m), Italy (1.3m), Turkey (1.1m) and Spain (1.1m). India was in 10th place till Thursday night, the latest period based on which comparisons can be made.However, while India's rollout has been the swiftest so far despite a late start, it has a longer distance to travel than other countries, with the exception of China, because of its bigger population. The first million doses translate to just 0.08 shots per 100 people in the country.On this score, Israel is far ahead of other nations, having given vaccine shots to 38 out of every 100 citizens even though the country’s vaccine programme has become controversial as it reportedly leaves out Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

Authorities allege that Miller posted photos and videos on his social media accounts that show him inside the Capitol during the Jan. 6 storming of the building by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. They also say he called for violence in online posts, including a tweet that simply read “Assassinate AOC,” a reference to the liberal Ocasio-Cortez.

In another tweet, Miller posted: “They are right next time we bring the guns,” an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit.

Miller also threatened a U.S. Capitol police officer during an exchange on Instagram, writing that he planned to “hug his neck with a nice rope,” the affidavit states.

After posting a photo on Facebook showing him inside the Capitol, Miller responded to a comment on the picture with: “just want to incriminate myself a little lol,” according to an FBI affidavit.

Ocasio-Cortez on Friday posted Miller’s charging documents on Twitter and then tweeted: “On one hand you have to laugh, and on the other know that the reason they were this brazen is because they thought they were going to succeed.”

Miller’s attorney, Clint Broden, said in an email to The Associated Press that Miller regrets the actions he took “in a misguided effort to show his support for former President Trump.”

“His social media comments reflect very ill-considered political hyperbole in very divided times and will certainly not be repeated in the future,” Broden said. “He looks forward to putting all of this behind him.”

“We are hopeful that, given his family support and regret for his actions, he will be released so that he can resolve the charges against him in a timely fashion,” Broden said.",FBI: Texan charged in Capitol riot tweeted ‘Assassinate AOC’,www.wdam.com

Karen Dombrowski, age 64, of Westport, was arrested by Westport Police on Wednesday, Jan. 20, for an incident that took place on Monday, March 25, 2019.

On March 25, 2019, at approximately 8:33 p.m. Westport Police officers responded to Compo Beach Road on a report of a disabled motor vehicle.

Upon arrival, an officer observed heavy damage on the right side of the car, according to Wilton PD Lieutenant David Wolf.

The driver, identified as Dombrowski told officers she allegedly did not know how her vehicle became damaged, Wolf said.

The investigating officer reported that when speaking with her, she exhibited physical clues consistent with being under the influence of alcohol.

She was transported to the hospital for treatment.

It was later discovered that Dombrowski likely struck a guardrail on Compo Beach Road as there was plastic debris from a motor vehicle near the damaged guardrail which matched her car, Wolf said.

A toxicology report showed that Dombrowski's blood alcohol limit was above the legal limit at the time of the crash and officers applied for an arrest warrant, police said.

Following her arrest, Dombrowski was charged with operating under the influence of alcohol/drugs, evading responsibility, and failure to drive in the right lane.

Dombrowski was released after posting a $1,000 bond and is scheduled to be arraigned at Norwalk Superior Court on Wednesday, Feb. 3.

29,30,https://www.wvasfm.org/post/mexicos-oscar-winning-directors-embrace-rise-fernando-fr-de-la-parra,"Mexican film directors have enjoyed success at the Academy Awards in recent years. Alfonso Cuarón won an Oscar for directing Gravity in 2014, and for Roma in 2019. Alejandro González Iñárritu won one in 2015 for directing Birdman and the following year for The Revenant. And Guillermo del Toro won his Oscar for directing The Shape of Water in 2018. Now, the ""Tres Amigos,"" as they're known, may welcome uno más: up-and-coming filmmaker Fernando Frías de la Parra. His film I'm No Longer Here is Mexico's Academy Award entry for Best International Feature Film.

The film, also titled Ya No Estoy Aqui, is set in 2010, during a real, but very brief, cultural phenomenon that happened in Monterrey, Mexico. That's when teens in the industrial city's impoverished barrios would hang out in the streets wearing baggy clothes, singing and dancing to nostalgic cumbia music from Colombia.

""I wanted to go deeper and understand why they were like dancing the way they dance, dressing the way they dress and associating in gangs,"" said Frías, who wrote and directed his fictionalized version of what's known as the ""Kolombia"" subculture. He said he discovered some of the why. ""It's an opportunity to reinvent themselves, knowing that there's not many options in life for them. It's like, you think that just because I'm poor, I am dangerous and I should be a criminal? You think I'm ugly or something? Well, I'm going to embrace your rejection and I'm going to recreate my identity with dignity by creating this style.""

In Frías' story, Ulises is the leader of a crew called Los Terkos, the stubborn ones. He has a DIY punk hairstyle, spiked here, bleached there. ""It almost resembles a pre-Hispanic Aztec warrior,"" noted Frías.

With his friends, Ulises dances like a slow rooster, twirling around with heel-toe, heel-toe footwork, hunched over with his arms up, ""like a big bird spreading the wings and dancing and showing off,"" Frías says. ""It's a unique style.""

After a rival gang threatens him, Ulises escapes from Monterrey. He crosses the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, and ends up in New York City, where he finds work with a construction crew. But he longs to be back in Monterrey, where no one makes fun of his style and he can be himself. Like the lyrics of the cumbia music he loves, Ulises is filled with nostalgia. Frías says Ulises' journey is more about ""the internal conflicts that he's living.""

Juan Daniel Garcia Treviño makes his acting debut as Ulises, having been discovered by Frías and his team at a music festival in Monterrey. They saw him playing percussion on stage, and afterwards, approached him, asking if he'd want to be in the film. At the time, Garcia was a 17-year-old construction worker who never imagined becoming an actor, much less the star of a film that could earn a spot on the Oscar short list, which will be announced on Feb. 9. Garcia and the other non-actors worked together for months to develop the characters and learn the dances.

""Here in Monterrey, the film reflects the real lives of a lot of people,"" Garcia says in Spanish. He says they're proud that Frías represented their culture authentically. The 20-year-old Garcia is now acting in his third film and says he and the others who played Los Terkos are grateful for the opportunity to portray the culture that has since faded away.

Frías says the Kolombia scene was disappearing even as he was researching it. ""It doesn't exist [now] because of the so-called war on drugs by the administration of President Calderón, who sent the army into the streets,"" he says. ""And this new cartel that came in was recruiting the kids, so that killed the life on the streets for several years. The music, though, it will always be part of the Monterrey people.""

The 41-year-old filmmaker grew up in Mexico City, the youngest of three children. His father was a lawyer and his mother worked for Pan American World Airways, allowing the family to travel the world. Frías studied communications and photography as an undergraduate in Mexico City, and made documentaries before going to Columbia University on a Fulbright scholarship. While earning his master's degree, he began writing his screenplay for I'm No Longer Here.

Frías persevered for seven years to make this film, with challenges that included repeatedly trying to secure a visa for Garcia to film in New York. Meanwhile, he made short documentaries for Condé Nast Traveler, and he directed the entire first season of HBO's Los Espookys. ""I liked the playfulness and absurdity of it,"" Frías says of the bilingual comedy series.

The filmmaker still lives in New York, where he's working on new projects. Meanwhile, I'm No Longer Here is streaming on Netflix, earning accolades and praise.

""I think is one of the most memorable debuts on film and Mexican film in the last couple of decades,"" Guillermo del Toro said in a video conversation recorded last year. ""It's a very painful and beautiful movie at the same time. It presents you with the usual melodramatic choices and discards them.""

""Yeah, it challenges all your expectations,"" Alfonso Cuarón agreed.

Del Toro praised Frías for portraying a culture that no longer exists and the experiences of a young man in exile trying to protect his identity. ""I think that is rare,"" he added, ""a movie that you find being done so early in the career of a young filmmaker that has the wisdom and the complete control of the medium. He inherits a mantle that you can trace back to the golden era of Mexican cinema.""

""Fernando for me, is already an inspiration,"" said Cuarón. ""He's truly original.""

Del Toro and Cuarón are rooting for Fernando Frías to join them as Oscar winners.



And finally, today, you might have noticed that Mexican directors have recently enjoyed much success at the Academy Awards. Alfonso Cuaron won Oscars for directing ""Gravity"" in 2014 and again in 2019 for ""Roma.""

Help 4 Kids Florence has partnered in the past week with the Morning News to spread the word about a community problem and to call attention to a solution: community stewardship. Time. Talent. Treasure. Volunteers donating their time. People donating food. People also give in other generous ways, primarily by providing financial support. Some of these supporters don’t want recognition for what they do. These are the voices of some anonymous donors, in their own words. My wife and I read the articles about Help 4 Kids in the Morning News last year and saw a chance to volunteer an hour or two a week. Spending time packing meals, hearing the stories about the needs in the community, and seeing how many meals went out each week made us realize the importance of Help 4 Kids. We wanted to help by volunteering to pack meals and giving financial support. Our volunteer time was cut short in March by the quarantine, but we hope to be back when we are vaccinated. Our community is fortunate to have so many dedicated people supporting the efforts to meet the needs of children who don’t have enough to eat.

We became a financial partner and periodic volunteer of Help 4 Kids Florence after learning about the unfortunate amount of hunger children experience on a regular basis. We appreciate Help 4 Kids’ mission and love the proven correlation of a child’s academic and behavioral success with the level of a child’s hunger. Help 4 Kids is a blessing to the Florence community and fills an importance need for our children. I got involved with Help 4 Kids because I believe it is one of the most effective and well-run charitable organizations in our area. In addition to a first-rate volunteer staff, it has broad financial and volunteer support from individuals, businesses, churches, service clubs, foundations, as well as teachers and administrators. All of these groups do an excellent job filling the weekend hunger gap for thousands of Florence County elementary school children. Help 4 Kids Florence has become an essential part of our community. As one of the many volunteers and financial supports, I strongly urge others to consider becoming active as well, to ensure these children can thrive and become healthy, productive members of society.

Thirteen residents have now lost their lives battling the virus in the last 16 days. Health Services is reporting 52 confirmed deaths as a result of the coronavirus since last March.

“We are saddened to share today that we have lost two more of our neighbors and friends during this pandemic,” Rachel Seeber, chairwoman of the Warren County Board of Supervisors, said in a statement.

“Please know that every one of our Warren County representatives shares in this loss with our community and commits to work harder with each passing day to find solutions to vaccination plans that will end this pandemic and keep our region safe.”

The latest deaths include a person who was in their 50s and another that was in their 80s, according to Health Services.

The county also reported a record number of hospitalizations at 23, an increase of four since Friday.

All 23 patients are said to be moderately ill, but one person living in a skilled nursing facility is in critical condition, Health Services said.

Four others who are not hospitalized are also moderately ill, while the remaining 353 cases are all mildly ill.","Warren County reports two more virus deaths, record number of coronavirus-related hospitalizations",poststar.com
33,34,https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/netaji-aide-who-coined-the-slogan-jai-hind-posthumously-honoured/cid/1804604,"Abid Hasan, aide to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the man who coined the slogan “Jai Hind”, was posthumously honoured at an event here on Saturday that resonated with messages of unity and secularism. Hasan, who was a major in the Indian National Army (INA) and served the country as a diplomat after Independence, was conferred with the Netaji Award 2021 by the Netaji Research Bureau at Netaji Bhavan. Bureau chairperson Sugata Bose, Netaji’s great-nephew and a Harvard history professor, delivered a speech on “Netaji, Abid Hasan and the Unity of India” that was peppered with anecdotes and highlighted the emphasis Netaji and his comrades laid on inclusiveness and secularism. Excerpts from the speech by Sugata Bose:

It was 51 years ago, January 1970. You can imagine the thrill of a boy just entering his teens to be told that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s sole Indian companion on his perilous 90-day submarine voyage from Europe to Asia in 1943 was coming to stay with his family. We happily vacated the children’s room as we were duty bound to do whenever Netaji’s close associates visited Calcutta. The room on the ground floor at 1 Woodburn Park was better known as “Nehru’s Room” because that was where Jawaharlal stayed as Sarat Chandra Bose’s guest during his visits to Calcutta during the freedom struggle. We were familiar with Abid Hasan’s photographs with his leader on the deck of the German submarine and their transfer together in mid-ocean on a rubber boat to the Japanese submarine. They were prominently displayed at the museum in Netaji Bhavan. His hair had greyed, but it was easy to recognise Netaji’s comrade-in-arms when he arrived at our home with a smile on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes, and in an instant endeared himself to us. Uncle Abid’s room had a door leading to the beautiful curved southern veranda of 1 Woodburn Park. That is where we gathered around him as he sat on a cane chair, looking at the eucalyptus tree in the distance, to hear him narrate his adventures with Netaji in Europe, the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and Asia.

The devotion and loyalty that Netaji elicited from his followers had to be seen to be believed. As with most other men and women of the INA I have met, Uncle Abid wept profusely as he remembered his leader. He had not yet written his oration when he arrived in Calcutta. He was provided with a desk and a chair along with my mother Krishna Bose’s Olivetti typewriter in one corner of the veranda. My mother was pleased to find someone who could beat her in the art of slow typing. After composing a passage, Uncle Abid would give us a shout and we would rush to hear what he had written. After reading a few sentences, his voice would choke with emotion. He became concerned that he would not be able to deliver the oration before the public. “How embarrassing it would be if I break down like this,” he kept saying. My mother tried to boost his morale with a steady supply of good food and music. He enjoyed Bengali cuisine, supplemented by a bowl of green chillies placed before him. I watched him sitting at the oval marble table in our dining room with beads of sweat appearing on his forehead as he munched the chillies. On the morning of January 23, 1970, at Netaji Bhavan, Abid Hasan delivered his beautifully crafted and deeply moving Netaji oration, titled “The Men from Imphal”, in a somewhat monotonous voice, struggling not to be overcome by emotion.

Abid Hasan then flashed back to October 1943, telling the story of Netaji’s visit to the Chettiar temple in Singapore. He (Netaji) had turned away the head priest, saying: “What! Come to your temple where even Hindus of other castes are not permitted entry, not to speak of members of other communities who are equally near and dear to me?” He agreed to go when the high priest returned with an invitation to “an Indian national demonstration”. “When we came to the temple,” Abid Hasan remembered, “I found it filled to capacity, with the uniforms of the INA officers and men and the black caps of south Indian Muslims glaringly evident. The memory I retain is one of an invigorating music — as that of a symphony dedicated to the unity of the motherland.” That music sustained him during his travails on the battlefield.

The extended interview with Abid Hasan that formed the basis of Krishna Bose’s long-form article Sainiker Smriti, later published as A Soldier Remembers in the Netaji Research Bureau’s journal, The Oracle, was conducted day and night between March 13 and 15, 1976. Uncle Abid was an indifferent public speaker but a very engaging conversationalist. Puffing an endless chain of cigarettes and sipping cold beer, he transported us to the military camps of the Indian Legion in Germany, the rehearsal of the national greeting “Jai Hind” with Netaji, the drama and discipline of the submarine voyage, the tumultuous public events and the intimate private moments with Netaji during the Azad Hind movement in Southeast Asia, and the saga in Imphal. Netaji had asked his followers in Europe to help him find a common national greeting that would have a nice ring to it and be acceptable to all religious communities. One day Abid Hasan heard some Rajput soldiers greet each other with “Jai Ramji ki”. It seemed to have a musical quality and Hasan changed it to “Jai Hindustan ki”. That did not quite work but the abbreviated form, “Jai Hind (Victory to India)”, sounded perfect and Netaji enthusiastically embraced it as India’s national greeting.

Always conscious of the need to foster unity among religious communities, Netaji had toyed with the idea of taking a Hindu, a Muslim and a Sikh on his journey to Asia. Once the German naval authorities told him that he could take only one aide, he picked Abid Hasan to be his companion. N.G. Swami and four others with advanced training in wireless telegraphy, secret inks and sophisticated radio transmitters were to follow on a blockade-runner in March. Abid Hasan was simply told to pack his bags for a long journey without any inkling of his destination. He thought that he might be sent to Mecca as part of a scheme to find anti-colonial recruits during the Haj. It was only when he met Netaji at Lehrter Bahnhof (a railway station in Berlin) that he realised he would be accompanying his leader. On the train from Berlin to Kiel, Netaji asked Abid Hasan: “Now, do you know where you’re going?” “Where are we going?” Netaji enquired. “We are both going to perform Haj,” Abid Hasan commented wryly, eliciting from his leader peals of laughter. He had truly become Netaji’s only companion on a pilgrimage to freedom.","Netaji aide, who coined the slogan 'Jai Hind', posthumously honoured",www.telegraphindia.com

I should know. Over the past 10 months I’ve tried everything: Spending money, spending less money, doing yoga, riding my dumb stationary bike, watching Gossip Girl. But at the end of the day, when I am still in my stupid little apartment and my brain is still on fire, I do have one last outlet I turn to to avoid the crushing reality of, well, everything: My trad wife influencers.

Lucky for me, my two best friends went to a small liberal arts college with a woman who became a devout wife, mother, and follower of Christ. This woman lives in the midwest, spends her days as a homemaker and homesteader, and also runs a fairly popular Instagram account where she proselytizes the wholesome goodness of a simple, God-driven lifestyle—cooking for her family, sewing aprons and skirts she sells on Etsy, reading the Bible cover to cover, and putting hand-knit bonnets on her sons’ heads. The whole thing feels very Little House on the Prairie.

Her life is so simple! She bakes oat muffins and grain-free quiche and she cans pears to save for the winter. She lights tall, tapered candles and puts them around her house during the day—like, when it is still light outside. She makes big, hearty meals for dinner. She had a birthday party for one of her sons during Covid and wrote a batshit post explaining her decision to host a big indoor gathering for him. (“Isolation has created more mental sickness than it has prevented physical sickness. We must be careful, but not so careful that we lose the ones we love. We may never know how important it is for a child to see their grandparents on their birthday.”) She wears ankle-length skirts out in the snow. In one post, she talks about flushing out theory she learned in college from her brain and replacing it with scripture.

My friends mentioned this woman so much that she became a spectral fourth member of our group chat, so I became one of her many tens of thousands of Instagram followers. Then my friend Kate wrote an article about how following this woman’s follies made her want to go full trad wife (A trad wife, if you have somehow made it this far without Googling it, is a traditional wife — one who sticks to traditional gender roles and broadcasts it on social media).

Kate noticed a lot of traffic to her story was coming from Reddit — in particular, a subreddit called r/fundiesnark, which seems similar to r/blogsnark, a different subreddit for people who have learned everything there is to learn about influencers and use their chosen forum as a place to dissect them. R/fundiesnark is entirely about fundamentalist Christian influencers and their ilk. People go there, post screenshots from trad wife Instagram and YouTube influencer accounts, and proceed to talk shit.

The trad wife I follow — along with careful research into her self-timer camera clicker she tries and fails to obscure in every photograph of her youngest child by placing him flat on his back on the cold, hard ground — appears to be a fan favorite, a dubious distinction on r/fundiesnark. So are trad influencers Girl Defined, The Collins Kids, and Paul & Morgan. Recent r/fundiesnark posts include topics like “does anyone know what fundies think of ivanka trump?” and “In honor of inauguration…here’s your local Karen freaking out about Biden winning!!”

VICE recently ran a story about how some of these fundie influencers are reaching hundreds of thousands of people on YouTube by talking about anti-abortion and abstinence. Some fundies lean heavily on aesthetics—baking bread, sewing, taking care of their kids—and avoid talking politics altogether. But some of the more outspoken ones lean heavily into their own polarizing bits, endorsing Qanon conspiracy theories, white supremacy, and ~just asking questions~ about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. It’s the same tired and dangerous talking points that have been beaten to death elsewhere by other people, only now they’re being spouted by 26-year-old women who know how to use Canva.

I started following some of these trad wives, the more aesthetic-based ones and not the more pernicious ones with out-there, far-right politics. (Even the political views of the more “I’m a homemaker, I read the Bible!” trads are the opposite of mine.) We have nothing in common. The religious content is a bit heavy handed for my personal sensibilities. They homeschooled their kids before it became medically necessary to do so because of Covid. They would take one look at my boring life in Brooklyn and call me a baby-killer communist hedonist whose eggs are dying, or something.

And yet here I am, scrolling through my feed, undeterred, unbothered, with an air of parasocial familiarity that I’d absolutely loathe to have applied to me and my boring Instagram, or worse, my Twitter. “Kelly’s plugging Levi’s woodworking side hustle again,” I inform the group chat. “His cutting boards look like shit.” Nobody in my life is completely off the hook from having to know about these people. “Is he wearing special trad glasses? He looks like he just moved to a frontier town to be a doctor,” my boyfriend texts me in response to a picture I sent him of the aforementioned husband. “What’s a trad wife?” my sister asks.

Part of the appeal of following these people comes from observing what kind of life I’d have had if I had just done a few things differently. It’s kind of like reactivating Facebook and checking in on people from high school who you haven’t thought about in 10 years, just to see what they’re up to, or going to the bar in your hometown on Thanksgiving Eve. If I hadn’t left the state for college, if I’d married someone right after high school, if I had reprioritized my life when I was 17—maybe that could be me with 38k Instagram followers, seven sons under the age of 10, and a house on a farm in Montana, a self-described “mama.”

In my own bubble, my friends are pairing off, getting married, buying houses and settling down. The aspirational lifestyle for my peers is moving to rural-ish upstate New York and homesteading. This is not altogether different from what the trad wives do aesthetically, but nobody I know does any of this kind of staid adulting with religiously driven fervor or for any kind of higher purpose — they’re just hoping to save some money and stay in love.

To be honest, I’m also drawn in by this grasp for simplicity I’ve been struggling with for a while. I did so many things last year to change my life when I was desperately unhappy, global pandemic aside. I moved into a new apartment. I started volunteering with my local mutual aid group in my new neighborhood. I got a new job, in a new industry. I worked out regularly. I started seeing a therapist and journaling. I stopped inhaling the news. I turned off push notifications. I’ve done so much to pare down my life, to strip away the worst of it. And yet in many ways I still want less.

So I understand the impulse. But while the trad wives’ response to wanting a simple life is to have 10 million white babies and photograph them on the ground and then put the whole thing on Instagram, mine is simply to chill out a bit. I don’t actually want to be a trad wife, but I understand the appeal of wanting to live a simpler life, one where perhaps you don’t read the news at all, live in blissful ignorance, read exactly one book, feed your family dinner every night, iron your husband Thaddeus’s work shirts, and insist on dressing like Anne of Green Gables for some reason.

Thankfully I don’t have to do any of these things to experience what this might be like, For now, it’s just enough to live vicariously through the trad wives I follow on Instagram as a form of voyeuristic escapism.","Help, I’m Obsessed With Trad Wife Influencers!",kosoff.medium.com

Rachel, now at West Seneca West High School, is navigating her senior year in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. When Rachel Scharf returned to West Seneca West High School earlier this month after 10 months of remote learning, ""it felt good, but, like weird."" ""The hallways are still very quiet,"" she said. ""No one is there, no one wants to talk."" Not exactly the fun-filled, invigorating first day of school a senior might imagine. ""It definitely felt different, like a first day kind of feel, but it definitely was not a normal first day,"" Rachel said. At lunch, Rachel sat in a desk next to her friend. The desks are spaced out with shields around them. ""They want you to sit facing the shield, sideways facing the shield,"" she said. ""If you're taking a break from eating and talking, they still want you to have the mask on."" In-person students at West High School are divided into three groups that attend school on alternate days. Students learning remotely at home log into the class via computer, and teachers usually have the students in the classroom do the same.

""It's different seeing the teacher bobbing her head up and down and talking to other kids in the classroom,"" Rachel said, adding it was not a ""bad different."" ""It's definitely different,"" said English teacher Trisha Petranek, who said students' first day back felt like the first day of school to her. ""Definitely nice to have human contact, even though it's socially distant."" West Seneca teachers honed their virtual teaching skills over the summer, and have been used to reaching students remotely since September, which has helped with hybrid teaching, when they simultaneously teach those in the classroom and those at home. ""Surprisingly, it wasn't a huge jump when we talk to kids in the room. I'll mute the ones at home and sometimes put the group at home in break-out sections,"" Petranek said. ""Everything seemed pretty normal to me, because we had been doing the remote stuff since the beginning,"" added math teacher Kelli Ruchalski. ""In the beginning it was a little tough getting used to not having any kids."" ""They're so resilient, not a lot of complaints, they're just happy to be back,"" Petranek said about teenagers. In Rachel's physical education class, the teacher gave instructions for the remote students. ""The virtual kids, I think did video on badminton rules and the kids in the school played badminton,"" Rachel said.

""It didn’t obviously feel like the first day of like school,"" Rachel said. ""It definitely felt like a first-time thing, waking up that early for the first time, getting ready and leaving, getting lunch together and leaving."" She got a ride with her friend and softball partner, Alexa Wisser. When school was all virtual, classes started at 9 a.m. But now they are back to the regular start time of 7:30 a.m. And yes, it's a bit of an adjustment getting up that early. ""The first day we did 7:30 I laid in bed until 7:25 and finally decided to get up and get my computer on,"" Rachel said. ""Today I had four alarms go off to wake me up."" And even though she's a senior, she got lost on her first day, after helping a freshman find her class. After all, she had not been in the school in nearly a year. She went her usual way, but stairways now are either up or down, and she was in the wrong stairwell and had to get to another staircase. ""Now that I know what's up and down, it will be easier in the future,"" she said. If Rachel needed anything else to let her know this was not a normal year, she she got it when she was selected for a random Covid-19 test. Schools in an orange zone like West Seneca must test 20% of in-person students and teachers each month. Rachel went after school for the rapid test, which is not as invasive as tests that take longer to get a result.","What's it like in school after 10 months at home?

36,37,https://www.kgoradio.com/news/families-find-throwing-laptops-and-wi-fi-at-students-isnt-enough-to-bridge-digital-divide/,"Every education expert knew that when the pandemic shuttered school buildings last March, America’s persistent digital divide would be a huge problem. A 2017 US Senate report found 12 million children didn’t have access to broadband internet at home. And administrators across the country warned that even students who had access may not have enough devices or a reliable enough connection to go to school online.

It was a huge problem, but one that appeared to have a relatively easy solution — governments, philanthropies and tech companies banded together to push out hundreds of thousands of devices to students who didn’t have them. Governments and internet service providers worked to provide reduced-cost or free broadband connections and Wi-Fi hotspots to families who couldn’t afford them.

Ten months into this pandemic, there’s now evidence that those measures were not enough to close the gap. Failing grades are rising in school districts across the country and attendance is an enduring problem. The impact is hardest felt among underserved students — those who are poorer or minorities.

One parents’ group in Oakland, California, has an idea of what went wrong. Simply dropping off a laptop and a hotspot just isn’t enough, they’ve found.

“We don’t appreciate just how much of a steep curve that this is for families,” Lakisha Young, a founder of Oakland REACH, told CNN. “We’re not having enough conversations about tech support, tech trainings, workshops, putting parents in a power position around technology.”

Oakland REACH provides intensive tech support for families who may be trying to use internet tools for the first time. Without that, Young says, the shiny new laptops and hotspots may just sit in the box they came in. And even if they don’t, the frustration over using technology that Americans with more means may take for granted can lead those who are unfamiliar with it to throw up their hands.

Connie Williams is one of the caregivers REACH works with. She is a strong advocate for her grandkids, who are all students in Oakland schools. She knows what it takes to be a good student, and she drives the children in her house to those goals. But she doesn’t know much about computers, and when school shifted online, it was a challenge.

“It was very frustrating, very frustrating, because I have very little knowledge of computer technology,” she told CNN. “But here I am: grandparent-slash-teacher now. So I got to get up to speed.”

Williams recalls how her grandkids came undone because they needed help with the digital tools their education now requires and Williams wasn’t able to help them.

“I’m in tears. I’m crying. My babies come snotting and crying to me,” she said. “And they’re like ‘Grandma, this is just too much.’ And I said, ‘I know it’s too much because it’s too much for me.'”

REACH gives people like Williams an intensive tech support program, as well as a dedicated person who checks in regularly and makes sure things are running smoothly. Young said some families they work with have never set up an email account or used a system like Zoom. It can take a long time to get people comfortable with technology that seems daunting to first-timers, she said.

REACH’s program worked for Williams and, according to Young, it’s worked for a lot of other families in Williams’ situation.

But it takes a lot of resources to do what REACH does. And not every student’s family can get access to that kind of assistance.

And so, as American students head toward the second half of this pandemic school year, Young says the lasting digital divide means a lot of students are going to be left behind.

“I definitely think that there’s going to be significant learning loss, especially where folks have not adapted to providing innovative and creative ways to really, really support families holistically,” she said. “It’s just really hard.”",Families find throwing laptops and Wi-Fi at students isn't enough to bridge digital divide,www.kgoradio.com
37,38,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/man-who-tweeted-about-assassinating-congresswoman-faces-charges-capitol-riot-n1255441,"A Texas man who posted numerous comments and images on social media showing him participating in the U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6, including a tweet calling for the assassination of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has been arrested, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Garret Miller, 34, was arrested Wednesday and was held in the Dallas County jail before he was transferred to federal custody early Friday morning. Miller is now facing charges in U.S. District Court related to the storming of the Capitol.

His charges include knowingly entering and remaining in restricted buildings without lawful authority, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, obstructing and impeding an official proceeding, and performing acts of civil disorder.

Miller is one of at least 119 people facing federal charges in connection to crimes committed during the Capitol riots.

The FBI first received a ""referral from law enforcement"" on Jan. 8 indicating that Miller posted a video from inside the U.S. Capitol on his Twitter account. The 14-second video posted on Jan. 6 captioned ""From inside congress” pans across a crowd inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda as people wave pro-Trump and U.S. flags. Upon further investigation, authorities found that Miller's Facebook account had ""many posts relating to his involvement in criminal activities at the Capitol,"" according to the criminal complaint.

Five days after storming in the Capitol, Miller posted photos of himself inside the building's rotunda while wearing a pro-Trump hat. The images seem to match some of the rotunda surveillance video obtained by law enforcement. In responding to comments left on his Facebook page, Miller acknowledged his participation in the pro-Trump riots to multiple individuals. In one tweet, Miller threatened to ""bring the guns"" next time, according to the criminal complaint.

In a string of tweets responding to Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Miller asserted that rioters “acted with honor and we where [sic] not armed. We where [sic] gentle with the police,” the criminal complaint reads. He then tweeted, “Assassinate AOC.”

In addition to posting his own actions at the Capitol on social media, Miller also discussed the shooting of a woman by a U.S. Capitol Police Officer during the pro-Trump riots saying, “We going to get a hold of [the USCP officer] and hug his neck with a nice rope,” the criminal complaint reads.

A detention hearing is scheduled for Monday, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.",Man who tweeted about assassinating Ocasio-Cortez faces charges in Capitol riot,www.nbcnews.com
38,39,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-pledges-climate-change-action-220529274.html,"Miami’s Republicans — who represent some of the country’s most vulnerable communities threatened by sea level rise and climate change — are more antagonistic than ever toward climate change legislation after President Joe Biden re-entered the Paris Climate Agreement on day one of his presidency.

Hoping to build on former President Donald Trump’s rise in popularity in Miami-Dade County in the 2020 election — despite his loss nationally — South Florida Republicans are digging in to fight further climate action, even as Miami-area environmental groups see opportunities for more gains.

Yoca Arditi-Rocha, executive director of a Florida-based climate action advocacy group called the CLEO Institute, sent a letter to each of Florida’s 27 U.S. House members and two senators a few minutes after the executive order was signed urging them to push for stricter pollution goals than those contained in the Paris accord.

Bold action is necessary, Arditi-Rocha said, because the cost of flooded roads and abandoning homes is higher than the cost of cutting pollution.

“If we don’t do anything to reverse this, it’s going to cost us billions in the next few decades,” she said. “The cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of reducing pollution.”

Biden’s swift move to rejoin the mostly symbolic Paris agreement is the first step in a climate plan to push for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Groups like Arditi-Rocha’s want Biden to aim for an even more ambitious goal — a 50% reduction of carbon emissions by 2030.

The fight on climate change policy is one of many in Washington where Biden has vowed to work with Republicans, but both sides’ preferred policy outcomes are far apart from each other. The COVID-19 pandemic, Trump’s looming impeachment trial and confirming Biden’s Cabinet are consuming the House and Senate, meaning any kind of sweeping climate change legislation will likely have to wait, even though Democrats control Congress and the White House.

In Miami, Republicans like former Reps. Carlos Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen were known for speaking out on climate change. But in 2021 only Republican Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar says she supports Biden’s decision to re-enter the Paris Climate Agreement. Miami Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart is opposed. And Rep. Carlos Gimenez once supported a Miami-Dade County resolution endorsing the Paris Climate Agreement, when he was the county’s mayor, but said during his campaign for Congress that “we should reenter something that doesn’t put us at a disadvantage.”

“Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement does little to help the environment, and only weakens the U.S. while enabling and strengthening China,” Diaz-Balart said in a statement.

Gimenez, who didn’t respond to questions on climate policy, said in 2017 as mayor that sea level rise is “a very serious concern” and said during his campaign that he supports infrastructure investments in clean energy. But he’s also faced criticism from environmentalists who said he didn’t do enough as mayor to lessen pollution or stop dirty storm water runoff from killing fish in Biscayne Bay.

None of South Florida’s Republicans offered alternative ideas to rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement or provided ideas on climate change-related legislation that could garner Republican votes in Congress.

But the CLEO Institute is among local groups pushing Biden to pursue an aggressive plan to cut down on climate pollution.

Arditi-Rocha’s organization, along with many others, is calling on the Biden administration to commit to at least a 50% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2030, a more ambitious goal than President Barack Obama set in 2016. If the world is able to achieve that, scientists believe there’s a chance that the planet can aim for only 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century and be spared some of the worst impacts of climate change.

Arditi-Rocha said that goal also lines up with Biden’s campaign promise to get the nation to net-zero emissions by 2050, a pledge countries such as China, South Korea, Japan and the United Kingdom have made.

“We as Floridians have a lot to lose with regards to the climate crisis. For us, [Biden’s climate plan] is a beacon of hope,” she said. “It means that we actually get to take the leadership of a new clean energy economy that’s not only going to stabilize our climate, it’s going to improve our air quality and create thousands and thousands of jobs.”

But both of Florida’s senators, Republicans Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, have opposed the Paris accord and Biden’s climate plan, arguing that India and China are mostly to blame for rising carbon emissions, and that the U.S. shouldn’t put itself at a competitive disadvantage.

“President Biden is throwing the U.S. back into the Paris agreement just to appease his liberal friends,” Scott said in a statement. ”This deal does nothing to hold real polluters, like Communist China and India, accountable and it unfairly puts American taxpayers on the hook. It was bad for America when Obama signed it and it’s still bad now.”

Trump showed little appetite for pursuing climate change legislation while in office and his decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement took effect on Nov. 4, a day after the 2020 election.

The politics of climate change have been increasingly defined by the Green New Deal, a sweeping set of policy proposals seeking to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions and to require the U.S. use 100% renewable energy sources. Scott brought up the plan on Thursday while he questioned Pete Buttigieg, Biden’s transportation secretary nominee, at his confirmation hearing.

Scott argued that the Green New Deal would cost $100 trillion, an astronomical figure frequently cited by Trump that appears to have originated from a former Rubio staffer’s tweet and not one of the Democrats pushing the proposal.

“The president won our primary and the election and that’ll be the vision that goes forward,” Buttigieg said in response.

Republicans with aspirations for higher office, Rubio and Scott included, have frequently campaigned against the Paris Climate Agreement, a pact signed by 195 countries in 2015 to limit the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that are partially responsible for climate change.

During his 2016 presidential campaign, Rubio opposed the agreement.

In the last two years, as the Green New Deal garnered most of the attention on Capitol Hill, Republicans have railed against the proposed legislation while left-leaning environmental groups like the Sunrise Movement have protested Democrats who are perceived as not being enthusiastic enough about the proposal.

Two sitting South Florida Democrats in Congress, Reps. Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson, cosponsored the House version of the Green New Deal. Former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who was beaten by Gimenez in November, was also a cosponsor and was attacked by Gimenez for her support of the proposal.

More middle-of-the-road climate change efforts like a carbon fee bill proposed by South Florida Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch have stalled, and fewer Republicans than at the beginning of Trump’s term are backing bills to tax carbon emissions. Deutch’s carbon fee bill in the most recent Congress garnered just one Republican co-sponsor, Florida Rep. Francis Rooney, who is no longer in office.

Curbelo, though he’s no longer in office, has continued to argue that there’s enough middle ground to pass legislation. He wrote a letter to Biden on Wednesday saying he believes there ares enough Republicans willing to work on climate-related legislation to pass something with bipartisan support.

“I assure you there are Republicans in Congress who will listen and who understand the significance and seriousness of this matter,” Curbelo wrote. “While it might be tempting for some to continue weaponizing this issue for political gain, regrettably there is no time for such games.”

Biden has acknowledged that he’ll need Congress to make major progress on fighting climate change. The Paris Agreement is a mostly symbolic pact that doesn’t penalize countries who fail to meet their emission reduction targets, allowing countries like China to continue polluting.

“We’re going to combat climate change in a way we have not before,” Biden said just before he signed the executive order, plus another to cancel construction on the Keystone XL oil pipeline. “They are just executive actions. They are important but we’re going to need legislation for a lot of the things we’re going to do.”","As Biden pledges climate change action, Florida activists want more while GOP digs in",news.yahoo.com

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said that if those who have been vaccinated begin easing off because they are protected, they are potentially putting at risk those further down the priority list who still need inoculation.

His warning came as the latest Government figures showed the number receiving the first dose of the vaccine across the UK has passed 5.8 million with a record 478,248 getting the jab in a single day.

Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Prof Van-Tam said it was still not known if people who had been vaccinated could still pass on the virus to others, even though they were protected from falling ill themselves.

“So even after you have had both doses of the vaccine you may still give Covid to someone else and the chains of transmission will then continue,” he wrote.

“If you change your behaviour you could still be spreading the virus, keeping the number of cases high and putting others at risk who also need their vaccine but are further down the queue.

“Regardless of whether someone has had their vaccination or not, it is vital that everyone follows the national restrictions and public health advice, as protection takes up to three weeks to kick in and we don’t yet know the impact of vaccines on transmission.

“The vaccine has brought considerable hope and we are in the final furlong of the pandemic but for now, vaccinated or not, we still have to follow the guidance for a bit longer.”

Prof Van-Tam also hit back at doctors who have criticised the decision to extend the gap between the first and second doses of the vaccine to 12 weeks.

The British Medical Association has written to the chief medical officer for England urging a rethink, saying that in the case of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine a maximum gap of six weeks had been mandated by the World Heath Organisation (WHO).

Prof Van-Tam said that extending the gap was the quickest way to get a first dose to as many people as possible as quickly as possible.

He said: “But what none of these (who ask reasonable questions) will tell me is: who on the at-risk list should suffer slower access to their first dose so that someone else who’s already had one dose (and therefore most of the protection) can get a second?”

BMA council chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said that while he understood the “rationale” behind the decision, no other country is taking the UK’s approach.

“We think the flexibility that the WHO offers of extending to 42 days is being stretched far too much to go from six weeks right through to 12 weeks,” he said.

“Obviously the protection will not vanish after six weeks but what we do not know is what level of protection will be offered. We should not be extrapolating data where we don’t have it.”

Meanwhile, it is reported that schools in England will not fully reopen next month – and may not return until after the Easter holidays.

The Sunday Times said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson was expected to rule out a return to the classroom after the February half-term break and prepare parents for a prolonged period of home-schooling ahead.

As recently as Thursday, Mr Williamson said that he hoped schools would be able to reopen before Easter, although Downing Street pointedly declined to endorse his comments.

The Government is also considering whether travel restrictions may need to be further tightened amid warnings that new variants of the virus discovered in Brazil and South Africa might be resistant to the vaccines.

Ministers are expected to meet this week to discuss a proposal to require people arriving in the UK to pay to quarantine in a designated hotel to ensure they are following the rules on self-isolating.","Keep following the rules after you get Covid jab, Van-Tam tells public",www.denbighshirefreepress.co.uk

UK variant should be watched, Fauci says

As the US set a new daily record for COVID-19 inoculations and states clamored for more vaccine supplies, Pfizer and the FDA said pharmacists and health practitioners can in some cases extract an additional dose from each vial.Originally, each vial of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine was designed to contain five doses, but some pharmacists reported they could extract six doses when using certain syringes, according to CNN. As a result, the FDA approved an updated label that states: ""Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract six doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial.""Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said this increase in doses per vial ""provides an additional 20% capacity."" The New York Times first reported Pfizer's plans to base its vaccine commitment on doses instead of vials.However, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said Friday the ability to garner the sixth dose with these syringes does not exist everywhere.""Many places have them,"" Gupta told CNN's John Berman, ""but not every place.""McKesson, a medical supplies company the federal government has contracted to help with distribution, said syringe kits that allow extraction of the sixth dose are being made available.These changes highlight the push to get as many people vaccinated as possible amid an inconsistent supply chain.About 5% of the US population -- roughly 17.4 million people -- has received at least one dose of the vaccine, and more than 3 million people are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data updated Saturday. Nearly 1.6 million vaccine doses were administered Friday, the largest one-day increase reported.As inoculation efforts build, the pandemic continues unabated. And while CNN's analysis of data shows encouraging trends in new daily cases and hospitalizations, health officials remain concerned about the apparently more-transmissible variant first identified in the UK.""You're going to see people traveling again, probably, for spring break, in March and April,"" said Dr. Celine Gounder, a former member of the Biden transition's COVID-19 advisory board. ""And that is exactly when we expect that these variants -- in particular, the UK variant -- to have taken hold in the US.""Cases: Johns Hopkins University reported more than 186,000 new cases on Friday. The US is currently averaging 180,816 new daily cases across seven days. That's the lowest since December 2, and down 27% from the peak seen January 11, when the average of new cases across a week hit 249,168. But the current average is still 2.7 times above the summer's highest level in July.Hospitalizations: On Friday, there were 116,264 COVID-19 patients in US hospitals, a metric that continues to drop day by day, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. That's the lowest since December 21, but it's still nearly twice the reported peak in the summer.Deaths: There were 3,655 new deaths reported Friday, per Johns Hopkins data . The US is averaging more than 3,000 new deaths a day across a week. With more than 68,152 deaths so far, January is currently the second deadliest month of the pandemic, behind December 2020. January is on track to surpass December's death toll of nearly 77,500 deaths.Meantime, California reported 764 COVID-19 deaths on Friday -- a pandemic high for the Golden State, according to the state's Department of Public Health.Jennifer Bagues, funeral director of Felipe Bagues Mortuary in Los Angeles, said her business has been bombarded, prompting her to hire new employees and an answering service to manage the surge in calls.""We have had to turn away families, which is really hard,"" she said, because funeral directors and their staffs also operate as support for families going through their ""toughest time.""""You have to tell them that, I can put you on a wait list and we'll get to you,"" Bagues said. ""That's unheard of in our industry. I've been doing this 25 years and I've never had this happen.""Hospitalizations in California are declining, dropping below 20,000 for the first time since Christmas, the Department of Public Health said Friday. But intensive care unit capacity remains scarce, with just 1,094 beds available statewide. The Southern California and San Joaquin Valley regions are still reporting 0% ICU capacity.A lack of information and a lack of financial support has left states struggling to manage a slow COVID-19 vaccine rollout, according to Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.""I am eligible in Minnesota to get a vaccination also and I can't find one,"" Osterholm, a former coronavirus adviser to President Joe Biden, told CNN's Erin Burnett on Friday. ""I want to share that frustration loud and clear.""Utah governor Spencer Cox told CNN's Chris Cuomo that the state is well-positioned for distribution, but that the vaccine allotment has been bottled up at private pharmacies nationwide.""Long-term care facilities in Utah, they have way too much vaccine. We estimate they have 15 to 16,000 extra doses that they don't need and can't use right now. So, we're taking that back and we're giving it to our local health departments and it will be gone next week,"" Cox said.The frustrations with vaccine distribution and concerns about supply have echoed across the country.Louisiana does not have any mass vaccination sites set up because it doesn't have enough vaccine to manage a site, Governor John Bel Edwards said Friday.The state of New York has administered 97% of its allocated first doses of vaccine, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday, and is expected to run out shortly.On Saturday, Cuomo spoke from a vaccine pop-up site at a public housing complex in Brooklyn, where he emphasized the importance of equal access to vaccines for Black and Brown communities that have disproportionately suffered from the pandemic.""Wealthier, White communities had more COVID testing,"" he said. ""When it comes to this vaccine, access has to be fair across the board.""In Texas, the Houston Health Department's 1,600 new vaccination appointment slots were filled by eligible citizens within approximately five minutes of opening. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said the telephone system received about 250,000 calls which ""literally overwhelmed"" the system.Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that she receives daily calls from people ""desperately looking for the vaccine,"" adding ""I'm just not seeing an abundance of vaccine.""The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health on Friday said it was receiving enough doses to inoculate just one in four people currently eligible.Utah's Cox said the competition between states early in the pandemic, when the federal government forced states to scrounge for supplies such as personal protective equipment, should be avoided in the case of vaccines.""This shouldn't be the Hunger Games, like it was with PPE, right. That was ridiculous and we all had to play that game,"" he said. ""We're all in this together. Governors are in this together. We just need insight from the federal government and the manufacturers,"" Cox said.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, spoke with CNN on Friday about the coronavirus variant known as B.1.1.7, which was first identified in the United Kingdom and is believed to be more contagious. He says its transmission in the US needs to be monitored carefully.At least 195 cases of the variant have been identified in 22 states , according to the CDC. That number doesn't represent the total number of cases in the US, the agency said, but just those that have been found through analysis.""It has not become dominant,"" Fauci said. ""It might. That's the reason why you have to watch it carefully as we go from January into February, and really take a good look.""A CDC report this month said the variant has the potential to ""increase the US pandemic trajectory in the coming months,"" and people should focus on using masks, maintaining social distance and other measures that reduce transmission.Fauci agreed with the health recommendations.

41,42,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/iconic-tv-and-radio-interviewer-larry-king-dead-at-87,"The iconic talk show host Larry King, one of the most recognizable figures on US television as he interviewed everyone who was anyone over a career spanning 60 years, died at the age of 87.

The company he co-founded, Ora Media, did not state a cause of death but media reports said King had been battling Covid-19 for weeks and had suffered several health problems in recent years.

King, with his trademark suspenders, black rim glasses and deep voice, was best known for a 25-year run as a talk show host on CNN's ""Larry King Live.""

""For 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry's many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster,"" Ora Media said in a statement posted on Twitter.

King's long list of interviewees ranged from every US president since 1974, world leaders Yasser Arafat and Vladimir Putin, and celebrities such as Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Barbra Streisand.

In an emotional last ""Larry King Live"" show in 2010, tributes included one from President Barack Obama, who in a video message called King ""one of the giants of broadcasting"".

Tributes from the media, politicians and Hollywood stars poured in, led by Putin, who hailed the interviewer's ""great professionalism and unquestioned journalistic authority,"" according to the Kremlin.

Veteran CNN foreign correspondent Christiane Amanpour remembered King as ""a giant of broadcasting and a master of the TV celebrity/statesman-woman interview.""

Star Trek icon and social media personality George Takei noted how King understood ""human triumph and frailty equally well,"" while Kirstie Alley, of ""Cheers"" fame, described him as ""one of the only talk show hosts who let you talk.""

British TV hosts Piers Morgan and Craig Ferguson, both of whom have had shows in the US, paid tribute to King's interviewing skills.

""Larry King was a hero of mine until we fell out after I replaced him at CNN & he said my show was 'like watching your mother-in-law go over a cliff in your new Bentley.' (He married 8 times so a mother-in-law expert),"" said Morgan.

""But he was a brilliant broadcaster & masterful TV interviewer.""

Born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger on November 19, 1933, to poor Russian Jewish immigrants in working-class Brooklyn, New York, King says he never wanted to be anything but a radio broadcaster.

At the age of 23 he went to Florida to try and find a job.

He became a disc-jockey for a Miami radio station in 1957, changing his name to King when the radio's manager told him it was ""too ethnic"".

For another Miami Beach radio station he recorded programs in a restaurant, doing live audience interviews.

In 1978 he went to Washington where he anchored a national late-night radio call-in show, before being spotted by CNN, a channel founded in 1980, which hired him for its nighttime programs in 1985.

""Larry King Live"", which ran from 1985-2010, broadcast six nights a week to more than 200 countries. CNN puts his total number of interviews at 30,000.

At the height of its success the show attracted more than a million viewers every night, making King the star of cable television, on the back of which he negotiated an annual salary of more than $7 million.

Structured in two parts, the show opened with King, typically in his signature rolled-up shirtsleeves and multi-colored ties, interviewing his guests in his relaxed style.

The second part of the show had the guest answering questions phoned in by viewers from around the world.

""I don't have an agenda. I don't assume the answer,"" King told the Miami Herald in 2017 of his approach to the job. ""I never learned anything when I was talking. Listening is as important,"" he said.

While critics found his easy-going interviewing style too soft, others saw it as the key to King's appeal, drawing so many star guests to his show and helping CNN establish itself with the scoops he won.

""I'm not interested in embarrassing (guests) nor am I interested in sucking up to them,"" he told AFP in 1995. ""I'm just curious.""

The show goes on

After CNN King continued to do interviews on his own website and then, in 2013, he hosted a new show, ""Larry King Now,"" on Russia Today, a government-funded Russian international television network.

His private life has been colorful too: after 22 years of marriage he divorced his seventh wife Shawn Southwick in 2019, having filed eight times for a divorce -- he married one wife twice.

""Instead of goodbye, how about so long?"" he said, voice breaking, as he signed off from his show that made him famous.",Iconic TV and radio interviewer Larry King dead at 87,www.sbs.com.au
42,43,https://www.norfolkandtillsonburgnews.com/news/local-news/john-brown-speaks-to-good-people-of-chatham-in-showtime-series,"U.S. abolitionist John Brown’s visit to Chatham in 1858 to recruit men for his raid on Harpers Ferry and draft a new constitution has been recreated for an American television series. The Good Lord Bird, which aired on Showtime in the fall, stars Ethan Hawke as Brown, who spends almost half of the fourth episode in Chatham, though the show was entirely filmed in Virginia. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. John Brown speaks to ‘good people of Chatham’ in Showtime series More often a dark comedy than historical drama, the miniseries is based on a novel by James McBride, which tells the story from the point of view of a fictional slave named Henry Shackleford who joins Brown on his quest to end slavery in the U.S. In the episode, Brown is left with little money and talks with Shackleford about going to Canada to recruit Black Canadians as soldiers. It then cuts to a scene of the two of them riding the back of a carriage with the title “Gentle Canada” across the screen. Hawke, as Brown, speaks those words later in the episode.

Eventually, a storefront with the name Chatham General Mercantile appears, confirming they are in the Maple City, with sidewalks bustling with people visiting the different establishments. Samantha Meredith, executive director of the Chatham-Kent Black Historical Society and Black Mecca Museum, said half of Chatham’s population at the time was Black and many had connections and money. “Chatham seemed to be the hotbed of where he wanted to go in Canada and gain these supporters because of how many influential Black people lived here at the time,” she said. In reality, Brown brought several of his supporters with him when he arrived in late April 1858. He then held meetings for the Chatham Convention on May 8 and May 10. In the series, all of this appears to happen in one day. Brown speaks at a church which one character refers to as the First Methodist. This may be a combination of the names of the British Methodist Episcopal Church and the First Baptist Church, where Brown held meetings, Meredith said. “When he was in Chatham, he held his first meeting at the BME church but, when they found out what he was going to do and what he was going to plan for, they kicked him out of the church and told him he couldn’t use it anymore,” she said. Other meetings followed at a school and fire hall on King Street. The final meetings were held at First Baptist, which has a plaque commemorating the event’s importance to the abolitionist movement.

“The meetings were an invite-only kind of thing, so he would send letters to the people he wanted to attend and they made a constitution of how the government was going to run when they overthrew it,” Meredith said. Brown’s plan was to spark a slave revolt by taking over the U.S. arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Va. During his speech at the church in the series, Brown addresses his audience as the “good people of Chatham.” Harriet Tubman is at Brown’s meeting in the TV series to help him convince the men to join his raid. Meredith said the two actually would have met when Brown was in St. Catharines on this visit to Ontario. Tubman, whom Brown referred to as “General,” was supposed to go with him on the raid, but she became ill. Once Brown went ahead with his plans at Harpers Ferry in October 1859, just one man from Chatham – Osborne Perry Anderson – took part in the raid. Anderson was born free in Pennsylvania and moved to Chatham in 1850. He survived the raid and returned to Chatham. Mary Ann Shadd, the editor of The Provincial Freeman newspaper, helped Anderson publish his account of the raid called A Voice from Harper’s Ferry in 1861. Brown and his men initially took the armory, but held it for less than two days against the U.S. Marines and militias. He was captured, tried for treason and hanged. A few other men from Chatham crossed into Michigan to help with the raid but turned back when they heard Brown had been captured, Meredith said. The Black Mecca Museum has one of Brown’s guns on display.

World Bank to make $429 million available for Fiji on highly concessional terms over the next 4 years

The World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework for Fiji for the next four years has been revealed which focuses on fostering private sector-led growth and inclusive economic opportunities and building resilience.

Over the next four years, the World Bank will be programming more than $429 million to support the implementation of the strategy; the most consequential level of support ever and most of it on highly-concessional loan terms.

At its core, the Framework supports Fiji’s forward planning to boost its economic recovery from COVID-19 and further strengthens Fiji’s resilience to future climate and public health emergencies.

Resident Representative for Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu, Lasse Melgaard says the World Bank Group’s support to Fiji has increased significantly in the past five years and they are delighted to see the partnership deepen further.

They will focus on creating investment and business opportunities; more jobs; improved access to finance; boosting the tourism and agriculture sectors; as well as better infrastructure, digital services and more clean energy. It also includes support to help Fiji gain access to funds both before and after a disaster strikes; improve emergency planning and increase resilient infrastructure; protect the environment and develop a sustainable Blue Economy; strengthen community resilience to climate and public health emergencies; and provide social assistance to help families and businesses that are in critical need.

The Framework is underpinned by an emphasis on strengthening governance and supporting gender equality.

This work will include creating more jobs for women and helping to address gender-based violence in the country.

The Framework is closely aligned with Fiji’s National Development Plan and was developed in close consultation with government, civil society and the private sector.

Central to the framework is a focus on supporting Fiji’s recovery from the economic and social impacts of COVID-19, as well as severe Tropical Cyclones Harold and Yasa; all three events having hit Fiji in 2020, in addition to the ongoing impacts of climate change.

Minister for Economy, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum says service-based economies like Fiji's have been worst-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, compounding our already-extreme vulnerabilities to climate change. He says the partnership with the World Bank holds the potential to enhance Fiji’s resilience to an array of external shocks, including the impacts of lethal pathogens and a warming planet.

Sayed-Khaiyum says the pace of our recovery over the next 12 months will determine our ability to meet the stated aims of the four-year partnership.

He says with the right support and access to adequate finance, the Fijian economy can indeed emerge stronger and more capable of seizing new opportunities but we must seek more than a short-term recovery.

The Minister for Economy says together with the World Bank, they hope to shape an international financial system that is more inclusive and more responsive to the development priorities of small states and the Global South.

As the largest global development organization focused on the private sector in emerging markets, International Finance Corporation is concentrating its efforts on mobilizing funds from the private sector to help finance development projects including in the areas of healthcare, renewable energy and affordable housing.

IFC Resident Representative for Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Kiribati and Tuvalu, Deva De Silva says with the triple impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and two cyclones, private sector solutions will be essential to help stimulate Fiji’s economy. He says while COVID-19 is leaving a deep scar on the economy and has impacted the livelihoods of many people, particularly those reliant on tourism, they also see an opportunity to build back better.

They are looking to create bridges between the public and private sectors to develop large scale initiatives, worth more than US$300 million and remain committed to supporting the government, including in the areas of tourism, financial systems reform, healthcare, affordable housing, renewable energy and improving gender equality.

The World Bank, which will mark 50 years of work in Fiji in 2021, including having financed the first construction of the Queens Road from Suva to Nadi, while IFC celebrates 42 years in Fiji this year, having recently signed a landmark agreement with Energy Fiji Limited to deliver the largest solar project of its kind in the Pacific, bringing Fiji a step closer to its goal of sourcing 100 percent of its energy from renewable sources.",World Bank to make $429 million available for Fiji on highly concessional terms over the next 4 years,www.fijivillage.com

A section of the audience at an event hosted by the Union culture ministry at Victoria Memorial to celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had erupted in chants of “Jai Shri Ram” as Mamata was invited to speak. The chanters ignored appeals from the emcee to “calm down” and allow the chief minister the “opportunity” to say a few words on this “auspicious occasion”. Mamata went up to the lectern and said in Hindi: “I think there should be some dignity to a government programme. This is a government programme, not that of a political party. This is a programme of all parties and of the people.” The sloganeering continued as she spoke. “I thank the Prime Minister and the Union culture ministry for holding this programme in Calcutta,” the chief minister said. “But it is unbecoming of you to invite someone and then insult them. In protest, I am not speaking any more. Jai Hind. Jai Bangla.” Mamata then returned to her seat, near that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who sat impassively. Union ministers Prahlad Patel, whose department had hosted the programme, and Babul Supriyo were also on the dais. The heckling should have upset the Prime Minister and his colleagues on several counts. In a culture that prides itself on treating the “atithi” (guest) as “deva” (a god), to insult a guest should be sacrilege; the slogan-shouting had disrespected the memory of the national icon whose anniversary was being celebrated; and it had shattered the dignity of a programme hosted by the Government of India.

If Modi was upset, he did not show it. Anyone who had expected the Prime Minister to condemn the boorish behaviour of his supporters or to apologise for it to Mamata, who was a guest at his government’s programme, would have been disappointed. In his 30-minute address, Modi uttered not a word on the subject. He spoke of Atmanirbhar Bharat and contended that his pet theme bore the imprint of Netaji’s philosophy.

 Mamata sat through the one hour that remained of the programme, occasionally looking up at the clear January sky. Not once was the “Jai Shri Ram” slogan heard after she spoke, making it clear the intent was only to heckle her. The BJP is known to use the chant variously as a greeting, a war cry and a taunt. Sources close to Mamata said she had initially been in two minds whether to attend the programme because she had had a busy day that began at 10.30am with a visit to Netaji Bhavan on Elgin Road. She later led a colourful procession through 7.5km from Shyambazar to Esplanade as part of the state government’s celebrations of the 125th anniversary of the icon from Bengal. Mamata eventually decided to go, joining Modi in inaugurating an exhibition on Netaji and then escorting him to the main venue on the Victoria Memorial lawns. “Despite her pressing schedule, she went to attend the central government programme…. But see the reception she received at the programme,” a source close to the chief minister said. “The BJP supporters proved once again that they don’t know Bengal’s culture,” said senior Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee. That something like this might happen was clear the moment Modi reached the venue at 4.28pm. As the Prime Minister’s image flashed on the giant screens, cries of “Jai Shri Ram” filled the air, much to the surprise of some in the audience who had received the invitation from the Union culture ministry. Sources in the BJP said that though it was a government programme, the state BJP unit took the lion’s share of the invites and distributed them among party leaders and loyalists. Party leaders were seen waiting at the south gate of Victoria Memorial, from where most of the invitees entered, with bunches of invitation cards and distributing them. When BJP state president Dilip Ghosh was entering the venue, most of the people waiting in the queue greeted him with “Jai Shri Ram”. “I see our people all around…. It’s like a party event,” a middle-aged man in a saffron bandhgala was overheard telling a man who claimed he had been to the airport to receive Modi. The same man was among those who raised the “Jai Shri Ram” chant when Mamata spoke. Asked why, he said: “Chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ is part of Indian culture…. If she (Mamata) has a problem with it, we can’t help it.” He refused to identify himself. But the state BJP was in two minds whether to endorse what happened in Victoria Memorial. “Such slogan-shouting at the programme was unfortunate,” said party spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya. Kailash Vijayvargiya, the BJP’s Bengal minder, however tweeted: “Greeting someone by Jai Shri Ram is considered insult by Mamata-ji. What kind of politics is this!”

50,51,https://www.kgoradio.com/news/larry-king-interview-famously-ends-with-marlon-brandos-on-the-mouth-kiss/,"Larry King over the years interviewed thousands — heads of state, movie stars, world class athletes, ordinary people — but one of his most memorable on-air conversations ended with Marlon Brando kissing him on the lips.

The 87-year-old iconic broadcaster died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to a statement posted Saturday on his verified Facebook account.

King hosted “Larry King Live” on CNN for 25 years — conducting more than 30,000 interviews, including the long, wide-ranging and at times bizarre 1994 conversation live from the home of Brando, the two-time Oscar winner.

Brando, who did not grant many interviews, was promoting his book, “Songs My Mother Taught Me.”

The interview famously ended with the two men singing “Got a Date with an Angel” and Brando giving King a peck on the lips.

Wendy Walker, then the show’s executive producer, lightheartedly recalled the moment on Saturday.

“The only time I ever got in trouble in my 32 years at CNN was when we were doing the interview with Marlon Brando,” she said. “And we were doing it from his house because at that time he was a recluse and … that was the only way he would do it.”

At the end of the 90-minute conversation, Walker said, King and Brando clearly were having a blast.

“They kissed on the set — which of course you remember that famous kiss. Well, I thought, ‘Oh my God this is such a TV iconic moment.’ Well … our lovely, loving boss that we love so much, Tom Johnson, called me and said, ‘Why did you let them kiss?’ ” she said, referring to Tom Johnson, CNN’s president at the time.

“And I said, ‘I guess I forgot … to tell them that if they were having a really good time that they shouldn’t kiss at the end of the show.'”

Johnson smiled as he recalled the Brando interview on CNN Saturday. “Larry King Live” was the only CNN show that reported directly to the network president.

“It wasn’t just a light kiss. It was a full frontal kiss of the two of them,” he said.

Such an event on television was a rarity: That same year two men on MTV’s “The Real World: San Francisco” kissed at the first ever commitment ceremony broadcast on U.S. television.

“And I just sat there … ready to get under the desk. I received a lot of calls from time to time but I knew that I would have them then — as I did. But my call to Wendy … it really was, ‘Wendy, Why? Why did you let that happen?’ “",Larry King interview famously ends with Marlon Brando's on-the-mouth kiss,www.kgoradio.com

52,53,https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/modi-vows-to-protect-assam-silent-on-caa/cid/1804588,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday used a function to distribute land pattas (documents) in poll-bound Assam to target previous governments and highlight the “unprecedented” speedy development taking place in the state and the Northeast but remained silent on contentious issues such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the deportation of illegal Bangladeshis.

Modi said the distribution of over one lakh land pattas to the indigenous population by the Sarbananda Sonowal-led government was a reflection of the ruling BJP’s commitment to protect the land, culture and language of the people of Assam, something the previous governments had allegedly not done.

He ceremonially launched the distribution of land allotment certificates by giving away land pattas to 10 beneficiaries at Jerenga Pathar, around 5km from Sivasagar town.

 Jerenga Pathar is associated with 17th century Ahom princess Joymati, a symbol of sacrifice, courage and righteousness, who gave up her life to save her husband and future king Gadapani.

The Prime Minister said that considering the importance of Sivasagar in the history of Assam, the government is taking steps to include the town among the five most important archaeological sites in the country.

Paying tribute to Joymati and the venue of balidan (sacrifice), Modi said the distribution of land pattas has benefited over one lakh families and is connected with self-respect, independence and safety of the original inhabitants. Taking a dig at previous governments, he said even after so many years of Independence, there were lakhs of families deprived of land pattas.

He said when the Sonowal government came to power in 2016, more than six lakh people had no papers to claim their land but his government allotted land pattas to more than two lakh families, reflecting its commitment towards protection of the rights of the indigenous people.

Modi said the over one lakh beneficiaries on Saturday can now be assured of the benefit of many government schemes which they were deprived of like the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, Kisan credit card and crop insurance policy. “Not only this, they will also be able to get loans from banks,” he said.

Modi said the rapid development and social protection of the tribals in Assam has been the commitment of the government, asserting many steps have also been taken to encourage Assamese language and literature. “Similarly in the last four-and-a-half years, efforts have been made to preserve places of historical and religious importance besides rapid steps being taken to free the encroachment and improve the Kaziranga National Park,” he said.

Though Modi said his government was committed to protecting the land, culture and language of Assam, he never once touched upon in his nearly 30-minute speech sensitive and contentious issues such as the CAA, the National Register of Citizens, deporting illegal Bangladeshis, Clause 6 of the Assam Accord, big dams and according Scheduled Tribe status to six communities of the state, which have dominated the public discourse in the run-up to his visit.

Even BJP national president J.P. Nadda had harped on the ruling party’s commitment to protecting the rights of the natives but skirted the contentious issues, except granting ST status to the six communities which was also not factually correct.

On Saturday, apart from listing out the benefits of the land patta move, Modi spoke mostly about the “unprecedented” development taking place in Assam and the region, a must for a self-reliant India.

He highlighted the benefits extended to the people of Assam under the health, sanitation, banking, education, energy, transport, connectivity and power sectors. He also lauded the state government for its role in managing the coronavirus crisis and hoped it will once again excel with the ongoing vaccination drive.

“Assam and the Northeast are instrumental in enhancing India’s connectivity with the East Asian countries. Assam is coming up as a major centre of Atmanirbhar Bharat due to its improved infrastructure,” he said.

Modi said every region of Assam is on the path of peace and progress because of the policy of taking every tribe together, including the uplift of the tea community that suffered for a long time due to neglect. “With the historic Bodo agreement, a large part of Assam now has returned to the path of peace and development. The recent election to the Bodoland Territorial Council in the wake of the agreement will usher in new paradigm of development,” he said.

The run-up to Modi’s visit was marked with protests against his trip and news meets seeking answers on the promises made by the Prime Minister and the BJP-led government between 2014 and 2016 but remained unfulfilled.

The All Assam Students’ Union and Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) had staged dharnas, around 5km and 3km respectively from Jerenga Pathar, against Modi’s visit and demanding scrapping of the CAA.

The act makes it easier for non-Muslims from neighbouring Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to acquire Indian citizenship, something those opposed to the CAA say is a threat to the very culture and identity the ruling party vows to protect.

The AASU and the Opposition Congress later questoned what was new in Modi’s address. “It was a routine speech. He did not talk about unfulfilled promises, of sending back Bangladeshis, the anti-Assam CAA, completion of the NRC or according ST status. He came to distribute land pattas which is a routine official procedure,” PCC chief Ripun Bora said.

AASU president Dipanka Nath, participating in a three-hour statewide dharna in protest against Modi’s visit, said the Prime Minister did not utter a single word on the CAA or Clause 6 of the Assam Accord. “We are firm in our resolve to get the CAA scrapped and will continue to protest,” Nath said.

Modi’s visit was followed by that of Union home minister Amit Shah, who chaired the 69th plenary of the North Eastern Council (NEC) in Shillong on Saturday. Shah reached Guwahati in the evening to launch the Ayushman Bharat scheme for central armed police forces. Shah will address two rallies in lower Assam on Sunday, his second visit since December.

The BJP has set a target of winning 100-plus seats in Assam in the Assembly polls to be held in April-May and January has seen the ruling party stepping up its campaign to retain the state.","Modi vows to protect Assam, silent on CAA",www.telegraphindia.com

Odisha and in particular Cuttack remembered its greatest son Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his 125th birth anniversary on Saturday.

Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan and a number of dignitaries visited Netaji’s parental home Janakinath Bhawan at Odia Bazar in Cuttack, which has been converted into a museum, and paid their tributes to the son of the soil.

Naveen also announced that a year-long celebration programme will be held to commemorate Netaji’s 125th birth anniversary.

“Netaji is a son of Cuttack’s soil. He was born and brought up here. This sacred soil of Cuttack inculcated in him the mantra of service, struggle and sacrifice. Hence, the state government has decided to celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji,” the chief minister said.

Later Naveen tweeted a number of pictures of Netaji on his Twitter account where the number of his followers have crossed 3 million.

As a mark of respect to Netaji, Naveen on Saturday laid the foundation stone of a new bus terminal in Cuttack, which will be developed as a model bus stand of the country. The bus terminal, named after Netaji, will be developed over 12 acres at a cost of Rs 65 crore.

The terminal will have all basic facilities and amenities like a food court, rooftop rainwater harvesting and an integrated information management system for the benefit of passengers.

The terminal will display motifs and paintings from Netaji’s life and his sacrifice for the country.

Besides Naveen, many other leaders, including minister Pradhan, visited Netaji’s parental home and offered floral tributes to one of the nation’s greatest martyrs.

Several paintings depicting Netaji’s life and his role in the freedom struggle have been put on display at Janakinath Bhawan which has been converted into Netaji Birth Place Museum.

The museum houses 13 galleries displaying rare photographs of Netaji’s early life, his time with Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj), provisional government of Azad Hind Fauj and Azad Hind Radio.

It also has a collection of more than 500 books.

Pradhan, who garlanded Netaji’s statue in the presence of other dignitaries, later tweeted: “Paid tribute to one of India’s greatest patriot Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at Jankinath Bhawan, his birthplace in Cuttack. Celebrating this day as #ParakramDivas is a befitting tribute to Netaji and a just honour for his stellar contribution in the freedom struggle of our nation.”

Sand artist Sudarshan Patnaik created a sand sculpture of Netaji at Puri beach on the occasion which drew a huge crowd.

Odisha also celebrated the 213th birth anniversary of another legendary freedom fighter and martyr Veer Surendra Sai. Pradhan unveiled a life-size statue of Sai in front of the Veer Surendra Sai airport in Jharsuguda district of western Odisha.

54,55,https://www.post-journal.com/news/community/2021/01/telehealth-now-mainstream-as-insurers-and-state-expand-access-to-care/,"Comprehensive telehealth legislation was an area of focus in Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s 11th State of the State Address.

“The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the inequities in our healthcare system and showed that telehealth is a critical tool to expand access and lower costs for low-income communities, especially for behavioral health support,” said Cuomo, as he took executive action to expand access to remote care.

Telehealth is when a patient and a provider communicate by audio, video or text messaging.

“The number of telehealth visits soared in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Stephen H. Cohen, senior vice president and chief medical officer at the Rochester-based health plan that includes Univera Healthcare. The plan processed 2.2 million telehealth claims in 2020, compared to 28,529 in 2019. Behavioral health services, including care for mental health and substance use issues, accounted for 43% of telehealth claims in 2020, compared to 25% in 2019.

Most adults in upstate New York (77 percent) have heard of telehealth though less than a third have used it, according to a survey commissioned in late 2020 by Univera. Of those adults who reported using telehealth, 90 percent did so since the outbreak of COVID-19.

The primary reason telehealth is currently used:

Required to use because of COVID – 59%

Preferred to use because of COVID – 34%

The most important features of telehealth:

The health plan, including Univera, spent $102 million in 2020 to expand telehealth coverage to all members and waive any member cost-share responsibility for telehealth services, regardless of the medical issue. The insurer increased provider reimbursement rates to help replace some of the revenue lost due to the decline in in-office patient visits. The health plan’s provider relations team trained more than 500 health care providers in the use of telehealth technology and proper claims submission for telehealth visits.

“When seeing a health care provider in person isn’t possible, or preferable, telehealth offers an effective alternative,” said Cohen. “Telehealth is here to stay, and our health plan will continue develop and support ways to increase access to this innovative way to get care.”",Telehealth Now Mainstream As Insurers And State Expand Access To Care,www.post-journal.com
55,56,https://thenationonlineng.net/out-trump-in-biden/,"In 1988 Donald Trump made speculations that he will be throwing his hat in the ring in the US presidential race. Nobody gave the ‘Real Estate’ mogul a chance as the then Vice-President George Bush Sr was the front liner by the opinion polls to succeed the legendary Ronald Reagan.

Trump known for his publicity stunts carefully weighed public opinion and decided not to press his ambition further. Not tired, he tried the same stunt in 1992 shortly after his famous bankruptcy filing and decided not to go ahead as there was no way he could have gotten the Republican party ticket as Bush had a very high approval rating no thanks to the Gulf War.

When he announced in 2016 that he will be running for the highest political office in Uncle Sam under the Republican Party, few gave him half of a chance. Historians saw it as one more stunt as the blonde clearly loved being in front of the camera. Political pundits laughed at him to scorn as well as his fellow contenders in the Grand Old Party (GOP). He did the unthinkable by clinching the ticket and the then US President Barack Obama warned the nation that he was unfit to govern the country.

No sooner had he won the primaries that he began to show his true colours of a racist and vile populist. He whipped up anti immigrant sentiments by opining that the immigrants were stealing jobs forgetting that America’s beauty is that it is a land built on the labour of immigrants and he himself is the grandson of a German immigrant. He promised to build a wall reminiscent of the Iron Curtain in the days of yore of the Cold War to permanently keep the Mexicans out of American soil. Like the Scion of the infamous Ku Klux Klan, he appealed to the Caucasians especially those whose economic fortune had nosedived, the Christian Evangelicals who were aghast at the progress being made by the Far Left especially with the legalization of same sex marriage under the Obama Presidency and the massive funding for abortion and its exportation overseas, his fellow racists who couldn’t live with the fact that a first generation immigrant of a Kenyan who went back to his country after his studies at Harvard now sat in the White House as real proof of the American dream. In the end he defeated Hillary Clinton by 304 to 227 even though the former First Lady surpassed him by nearly 2.9 million popular votes.

The Bull in the China Shop in fairness to him has to his credit massive job creation for Americans owing to his controversial success as a businessman. For the first time since Franklin Delano Roosevelt who launched the New Deal in 1933 which saw the American economy recover exponentially from the Great Depression, the economy in the early years of Trump roared like a Lion and it was inclusive of the blacks and other ethnic minorities.

His asinine racist tendencies greatly eroded the gains he made. He placed a ban on some Muslim nationals coming into the country dismissing them as terrorists. He abolished Obamacare that brought relief to millions of poor Americans who were hitherto denied affordable healthcare as it is the most expensive in the world. Trump didn’t mind leaving the vulnerable including the homeless at the mercy of the ruthless sharks called the Pharmaceutical companies who operate like the modern day reincarnation of the Shakespearean Shylock. His immigration policies separated children from their immigrant parents especially from Mexico and illegal immigrants lived in the perpetual fear of a heartless deportation even in some cases when they were children of illegal immigrants.

His ‘America First’ saw the shrinking of Uncle Sam in global politics as he pulled her out of the Paris Climate Agreement and the Iran Nuclear Deal. He snubbed Africa as his relationship with the continent was paternalistic and patronizing and he couldn’t be bothered to visit any country there.

Some officials from the World Health Organization warned him as far back as January 2020 of the corona virus but he dismissed it with the wave of the hand. His lackadaisical attitude towards providing effective leadership cost his countrymen over 400,000 lives and made mincemeat of his economic progress as over one million of his countrymen filed for unemployment benefits.

When he was up for re-election against Joe Biden late last year, he called the latter all sorts of derogatory names most notably ‘Sleepy Joe.’ Biden went on to defeat with a landslide of 306 to 232 Electoral College votes and by securing 81 million popular votes – the highest ever in the annals of American electoral history.

Trump, being a sore loser would hear none of it. He couldn’t act like a gentleman by congratulating Biden. Instead he called the election a fraud and rallied his riotous supporters on Twitter to an insurrection on the Capitol Hill on January 6 when the Senate met to confirm Biden’s electoral victory.

At the end of the day, the social media giants – Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Youtube permanently banned him from their platforms and his right wing supporters found refuge in Parler created by John Matze and backed by conservative journalist Dan Bongino which was later yanked off from Amazon web hosting services. Like a child whose candy was taken away from him, he refused to attend Joe Biden’s Inauguration yesterday.

Joe Biden has the onerous task of uniting the bitterly divided country which has been badly polarized by his predecessor’s childish and rancorous antics. He has to make sure that all Americans are given the equal opportunity to dream without any iota of racial barriers.

The theme of his inaugural speech was hope as he said ‘We will write an American story of hope.’ America badly needs a gargantuan dose of hope as the pandemic has rendered many economically destitute.

We commend his $1.9 trillion stimulus package which will see the poorest of the poor receiving $2000 a month. This will in no small measure restore their dignity and put a smile on their beleaguered faces.

Biden has the common touch which makes his story relatable and resonates with the common American. He struggled through school and didn’t attend any of the Ivy Leagues that traditionally produce the Presidents. 2020 was his third attempt at the Presidency having lost in 1988 and 2000. He had a personal tragedy in 1972 when he was just elected into the Senate. He lost his young wife and daughter in a car accident and was sworn in from the hospital as he attended to his injured son. He also lost his son, a former Attorney-General of Delaware to brain cancer while he was Vice-President. In a video widely circulated by Arise News, he put a call across to a Nigerian man and his daughter thanking him for his $12 contribution to his campaign and bonding with them on the phone. This shows the humane side of him not common with African especially Nigerian politicians.

On his first day at work he has overturned some of Trump’s policies by signing some executive orders which included the rejoining of the Paris Climate Accord, Ending the travel ban from several Muslim majority countries and bringing back America into the World Health Organization (WHO).

We are confident that his Presidency will spell a better deal for Africa as opposed to Trump’s isolationist one.

Biden scores a first in being the oldest American President at 78 and the second Roman-Catholic after John Fitzgerald Kennedy to sit in the White House.

We wish him the best of luck!

Vijayvargiya, who is BJP in-charge of West Bengal, said he failed ""to understand what is the problem in chanting Jai Shri Ram and why Mamataji gets annoyed with it"".

""I think the slogan was raised in her honour when she stood up. Leaving the dais because of the slogan shows nothing but her frustration,"" he said.

The West Bengal Chief Minister did not deliver her speech ""in protest"" during the event at Victoria Memorial to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose after 'Jai Shree Ram' slogans were raised when she was invited to speak.

The Chief Minister said ""government programme should have some dignity"" and it ""is not fair to insult somebody whom you have invited"".

The event was presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In her brief remarks, a visibly upset Mamata Banerjee said it was a government programme and not that of a political party.

The Trinamool Congress leader also said that she was grateful to the Prime Minister and Cultural Ministry for organising the event at Kolkata.

As of Monday, Jan. 25, Prisma Health says it will not take any first dose walk-ins at any vaccination sites in its Midlands locations. The same applies to the Upstate locations.

According to Prisma, since the COVID-19 vaccine was made available in December, they have administered the most vaccinations of any provider in South Carolina with 68,867 doses as of Jan. 22, which is 25% of all the Pfizer vaccine doses received in the state.

Because of the quantity of doses administered, their supply is low, according to the health system.

Prisma Health will only take patients with scheduled appointments in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Vaccination Administration Management System (VAMS) for that day, and those who need their second dose. The second dose is recommended within 17-25 days after the first dose.

“We are asking the public for their patience, as right now the number of individuals who want a vaccine far, far exceeds the number of vaccine doses we have received from public officials,” said Dr. Saria Saccocio, Prisma Health chief medical officer for Ambulatory Services and co-chair of the Prisma Health Vaccine Task Force. “Today’s announcement means that across our entire system – Upstate and Midlands – we are no longer taking walk-ins.”

According to Prisma Health, if patients received a cancelation notice of their CDC VAMS appointment for your Prisma Health location, the appointment should be kept as scheduled.

“We have no excess inventory of vaccine,” Saccocio continued. “We only received 25% of what we requested from the state for this week’s vaccine supply. Next week we have requested 60,000 vaccine doses to meet our demand. This is a national vaccine supply problem that is affecting the entire country.”

Eligible people with an appointment must go to get their vaccine when schedule, and bring a QR code, according to Prisma Health. They also need some sort of ID.

Those 70 and older who do not have access to computers or smart phones should call 1-833-2PRISMA for assistance or reach out to community members.

The state is currently in Phase 1a, where those hospitalized age 65 and older and those community members aged 70 and older can receive their vaccination.

Recipients of Covaxin, India’s indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, would have to sign informed consent forms before they are administered the vaccine, the Centre informed officials of the state health department on Saturday.

The state health department or the vaccinating site has to call the person after seven days and again after 28 days to enquire about the person’s health. The recipient must also fill up a form if they experience any serious events after receiving Covaxin, said Ajay Chakraborty, the director of state health services.

Simultaneously, the Union health ministry announced on Saturday that Bengal would be among seven new states that would begin administering Covaxin next week in addition to 12 states that started administering the vaccine last week.

Till now Bengal had been administering only the Covishield vaccine, which is developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.

India has vaccinated 15.37 lakh healthcare workers since the nationwide campaign started on January 16.

Bengal received its first batch of 1.6 lakh Covaxin doses on Friday. During a video conference on Saturday, the state health department officials were told by officials of the health ministry that recipients of Covaxin must give a written consent that they have agreed to take the home-grown vaccine.

There is no such requirement for administering Covishield, manufactured in India by the Serum Institute of India. The state has received 13.88 lakh doses of Covishield and is administering the vaccine to all healthcare workers.

Senior officials of the state health department held a meeting among themselves on Friday where many raised concerns what would happen if recipients refused to be administered Covaxin doses. During Saturday’s video conference, officials of health ministry told the state officials that there was no possibility of taking back the Covaxin doses.

“The Centre will send us a consent form where recipients have to sign before they are administered the vaccine. They will give their informed consent before they are inoculated with Covaxin,” said Chakraborty, the state health services director. He said the consent was required since full data of phase-III trial of Covaxin is still not available. “There would have been no requirement of a consent form if phase-III trial results were available. But this is just an added precautionary measure. Covaxin has passed the safety trial and there is no reason to be afraid. The vaccine has been prepared using a time tested technology, which is using an inactivated virus,” he added.

State health department officials did not have clarity on the content of the consent form till Saturday.

The fact sheet supplied with Covaxin — which contains general information about the vaccine — mentions that the vaccine is undergoing efficacy trials. “A phase III efficacy study is ongoing in 25,800 participants and administered with first dose of vaccination with Covaxin, no vaccine related adverse events were observed”.

Chakraborty added that the phase-III trial results of Covaxin will be available only after at least another three of four months. “But we cannot solely depend on Covishield because that will slow down the vaccination programme,” he said.

Dipyaman Ganguly, an immunologist with the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, explained the three phases of trial. “The phase I trial assessed whether the vaccine is safe to administer to a person. In case of Covaxin, phase II trial only assessed if the vaccine generated immune response in the recipient. The phase III trial will assess whether the vaccine has efficacy in preventing the disease for a considerable period of time,” he said.

The Covaxin fact sheet also mention that those with fever or severe infection, pregnant and lactating mothers, individuals below 18 years and those who are sensitive to the ingredients of the vaccine should not take it. “Covaxin should be administered as two doses on Day 0 and Day 28,” the fact sheet added.",Coronavirus outbreak: consent form for Covaxin recipients,www.telegraphindia.com

RJD chief Lalu Prasad was flown to AIIMS, New Delhi, in a chartered flight on Saturday evening after he complained of breathing discomfort caused by pneumonia.

Lalu, the former Bihar chief minister who is serving a jail term in fodder scam cases, had been receiving treatment at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (RIMS) in Ranchi. After a medical team advised better care, the 72-year-old leader was flown to Delhi around 6pm, Jharkhand inspector-general of prisons Birendra Bhusan told The Telegraph.

“It was on the recommendation of the eight-member medical team that we decided to shift him for better treatment to AIIMS, Delhi. He was flown to Delhi in a chartered plane, accompanied by a doctor from RIMS. Medical experts at Ranchi expect him to recover in a fortnight,” Bhusan said.

Sources at RIMS, where Lalu had been undergoing treatment for more than a year, said the leader had been suffering from a kidney ailment and diabetes, and his health worsened on Friday when a bout of pneumonia caused breathing discomfort.

“We constituted a medical team and decided to recommend that he be shifted to AIMS in Delhi for better treatment considering his comorbidities and age. We have sent a senior doctor from the medicine unit with him. He will accompany Lalu Prasad till his admission at AIIMS,” said RIMS director Dr Kameshwar Prasad.

Lalu had been receiving treatment at Ranchi’s Birsa Munda central jail since December 2017 after his conviction in the multi-crore fodder scam. He had been shifted to RIMS in 2018.

On Friday night, Lalu’s wife Rabri Devi, daughter Misa Bharti and younger son Tejashwi met him in Ranchi.

Tejashwi, the leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly, had on Friday told the media that his father’s condition was serious.

61,62,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2021/01/24/finally-in-the-dock-after-18-years,"IT has taken more than 18 years but finally Indonesian terrorist Riduan Isamuddin @ Hambali and his two Malaysian lieutenants – Mohammed Farik Amin and Mohammed Nazir Lep – will be formally charged for their terror acts.

Farik and Nazir will become the first Malaysians to be charged with terrorist activities in a US court.

The Star first reported in 2009 of the plan by the United States to charge the three, regarded as “highly dangerous” by international intelligence agencies.

Farik and Nazir were members of the outlawed radical Jemaah Islamiyah, which wanted to set up a pan-Islamic region spanning Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei through violent means, and the al-Qaeda terror network.

All three (Hambali, Farik and Nazir) were implicated in the nightclub bombings in Bali in 2002, in which 202 people were killed, and the 2003 bomb attack at the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta which killed 12 people.

The Malaysians have also been implicated in a planned al-Qaeda plot to crash a hijacked plane into the 73-storey Library Tower/US Bank Tower in Los Angeles.

Farik and Nazir had the dubious distinction of being listed among 14 key terror suspects by the United States.

They were held in Camp Delta in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, by the United States.

Both men, who had received arms training in Afghanistan, were arrested in 2003 in Bangkok in a special joint operation involving the Thai national police and the US Central Intelligence Agency.

Their arrests led to the capture of Hambali, a key man for Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda network in South-East Asia.

When the three appear in court, it will be the first time the world will see how they look like now.

Even when Hambali was actively involved in terrorism activities, he was a man who kept changing his facial and physical appearances – but the image of the chubby-faced person which most media use till today – is likely to have turned frail and thin.

The activities of Hambali and the other terrorists had always been a topic that The Star has tracked.

Since 2003, this media group has written extensively about their activities by speaking to former terrorists, intelligence agencies and groups which studied their movements, both local and foreign.

My former colleague Datuk Lourdes Charles and I have a special interest in the latest developments on the three terrorists because we worked on this from day one.

The last known picture was published by Mstar – the Bahasa Malaysia news portal of The Star. It was a world exclusive.

My Sabah colleagues, Datuk Muguntan Vanar and PK Katharason who has since retired, tracked Hambali’s wife, Noralwiza Lee Abdullah, 39, a Malaysian from Sandakan, Sabah.

She was also detained under the Internal Security Act in 2003 but was released in 2007.

The Star team obtained from her the picture as she was allowed to exchange correspondence with her husband with the International Red Cross Society’s assistance. There were also Hari Raya cards sent from Hambali to her.

Since news of the formal charges against Hambali and the two Malaysians broke on Thursday, we have tried to locate Noralwiza but with no success yet.

There is talk that she may have moved to Cianjur, West Java in Indonesia, to be with Hambali’s family, including his siblings.

It is understood that at the high security block at Guantanamo Bay, the US naval base, they were probably being kept in one of the seven detention camps at Camp Delta.

These are maximum security camps that can house up to 800 detainees, including those in solitary confinement.

For Farik from Selangor and Nazir, a Johorean, they would have probably been held at the maximum security Camp Three when they first arrived.

“The 2m by 2.4m cells only have a squatting toilet, metal sink and sleeping berth fixed to the walls. They would probably be allowed out of their cells three times a week, but they cannot exercise with the other inmates, ” said a source.

They have to wear orange uniforms and items such as toilet paper and shampoo will only be available on request. Cell lights are turned on 24 hours a day.

Intelligence sources said the two were arrested in a joint operation involving the CIA and Thai police in Bangkok in 2003.

Several days later, their mentor – Hambali – was arrested.

In covering the network of the terrorism groups, Charles, now a businessman, obtained very in-depth information from Indonesian sources on their terror ambitions.

They included meetings in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, which had a reputation of being a hotbed of radicalism.

It had attracted the attention of militants such as Abubakar Ba’asyir and Agus Dwikarna.

Abubakar, 82, who headed the Jemaah Islamiyah with links to al-Qaeda, was released on Jan 8 this year after being sentenced to 15 years in 2011 for supporting militant training in conservative Aceh province.

But the term was later cut due to sentence reductions. Officials reportedly said he had “served his punishment well”.

Dwikarna, who led the militant Laskar Jundullah (Army of Allah), is serving a 17-year jail term in the Philippines for illegal possession of explosives and suspected involvement in bombings in Manila and Jakarta.

Laskar Jundullah achieved notoriety when its 50,000 members forcibly raided hotels for American tourists in 2002.

In December 2020, Dwikarna reportedly said he was mulling an appeal of the court’s verdict that handed him a prison term of 10 to 17 years for illegal possession of explosives.

Dwikarna expressed his intention to appeal his conviction at a meeting with a 13-member Indonesian delegation that visited him in jail at Camp Crame in Manila.

In carrying out our investigations, Charles also scored major news exclusives by getting jailed terrorists like Dwikarna and others to speak to him while in prison.

They included Taufik Abdul Halim aka Dani, the Malaysian who was sentenced to death by the Indonesian authorities for his involvement in terrorist activities, including the bombing of churches in the republic in 2001, but had the sentence commuted to life imprisonment.

Taufik, a Universiti Institut Teknologi Mara (UiTM) graduate, gained notoriety when he was caught setting off a bomb at the Plaza Atrium in Jakarta on Aug 1 two years ago.

His target was the church worshippers leaving the premises on the third floor of the complex.

Charles also met Abubakar through his contacts at the Cipinang Penitentiary Institution in Jakarta. But Indonesian officials who found out about his surprise visit cut short the meeting and insisted that there would be no interviews while threatening to act against our reporter.

But in carrying out our work, which spanned nearly a decade, we faced numerous threats and had to seek the advice of our Malaysian police, which certainly has one of the best anti-terrorism outfits in the world.

We reported on a meeting of the mujahidin in Yogyakarta in 2002, which was attended by quasi-military groups from all over south Sulawesi.

We named some famous Malaysian political figures who were also present. We did not imply anything but merely stated a fact. But both of us were decreed as “anti-Islam” and “infidels” at a gathering of thousands of people.

We subsequently received death threats and police reports had to be made. The police traced some of these calls but we decided not to pursue the matter even though the culprits were identified.

The Star has had its articles plagiarised by international TV news networks without crediting us.

Interestingly, for this writer, the interest in terrorism began in 2001 when I walked into a bookshop selling religious books in Jalan Masjid India, Kuala Lumpur, where you can meet and interact with all kinds of colourful characters, as well as those one should stay away from.

One book caught my attention – Zainon Ismail had written about his exploits in a book titled Jihad Anak Melayu di Afghanistan – Merintis Jalan Syuhada (Young Malays in Afghanistan – Following the Syahid Route).

The then PAS branch committee member used a pseudonym, C.N. Al Af Ghani, and while giving sketchy details of himself, used pictures of himself dressed up as a mujahid in his book.

The 112-page book also carried pictures of other heavily-armed Malaysians who had decided to fight the Russians who occupied Afghanistan then.

But everyone in PAS and the Special Branch knew the author was Zainon, a farmer who was active in the party’s grassroots operations.

He had made his way to Peshawar, Pakistan, before heading towards Afghanistan to join a group called Harakat Ul Jehad al Islami, headed by commander Khalid Zubir.

The author wrote about his experience using the famed Russian made AK-47 automatic rifle, favoured by terrorists, in his pursuit. In the group was another Malaysian, one Fauzi Ismail.

Upon his return to Malaysia, Zainon was eventually arrested under the ISA and seven others for alleged involvement in Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia (KMM), a local militant religious group with international links.

The eight, aged between 32 and 45, were picked up in Terengganu, Perak, Kedah and Johor in August 2001.

The party also sacked Zainon due to his big fight with the PAS leadership over the use of funds collected for party members and their widows in the Memali incident.

In the 1985 incident, 18 people including four policemen, were killed in Memali, Baling, during the clash between the police and followers of Ibrahim Libya, a PAS member who believed jihad was the only way to topple the government.

In the case of the KMM members, they were detained under the ISA for alleged links to the murder of Lunas assemblyman Dr Joe Fernandez in 2000.

They were also believed to be responsible for bombing a church and a Hindu temple, and also the attack on the Guar Chempedak police station on Feb 4,2001.

Finally, it is now 2021, and for a world which has been gripped by terrorism, we will finally get to see the faces of the alleged killers.

Interestingly, before Sept 11,2001, no one was interested in the militants.

Malaysia was constantly criticised for using the Internal Security Act to lock up these dangerous people and not filing formal charges.

But the irony is that the United States has kept Hambali, Nazir and Farik for years and only filed formal charges now.

Many others continue to be detained without trial in Guantanamo Bay and other secret locations.",Finally in the dock after 18 years,www.thestar.com.my
62,63,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/obama-wanted-to-close-gitmo-will-biden-be-able-to-finally-do-it,"President Biden’s Secretary of Defense, General LLoyd Austin has said he would follow through on President Obama’s efforts to close Guantanamo Bay, the prison for terrorism detainees. Today, its population is down to nearly 40, including six detainees cleared for release. Michel Paradis who has represented Gitmo detainees and has authored the book “ Last Mission To Tokyo” joins for more.
• It's been 19 years since the United States opened a prison at the Guantanamo Bay Navy base for war on terrorism detainees, the population, once close to 800 prisoners, now stands at 40. Most were held without a trial. Six of those 40 detainees have been cleared for release, but the office to relocate them was closed four years ago. The Obama administration failed to close Guantanamo. President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense General Lloyd Austin said he will follow through on closing it, but there are still hurdles in the way. Michel Paradis is a leading human rights lawyer who has represented Guantanamo detainees. He's also a scholar of national security law and author of the book ""Last Mission to Tokyo."" First, just to bring our audience up to speed, Gitmo has been up and running for so long now that there's an entire generation that has grown up with it their whole lives that they don't really realize what it is. So what is Guantanamo Bay?
• Yes. So the population has largely been sent to foreign countries. In fact, six of the men in Guantanamo today have been cleared for release, some for as much as a decade. And there have been a variety of political, legal, diplomatic obstacles to simply making good on that release recommendation to send them to a foreign country where they can be held. Although one detainee, in fact, a number of Guantanamo detainees have actually been held for various periods in the United States, most people don't know that. There was one individual by the name of Yasser Hamdi, who was a Guantanamo detainee who turned out to have American citizenship. He was brought and held for a number of years in the Charleston brig. Another Guantanamo detainee by the name of Ahmed Ghailani was brought to New York in 2009, prosecuted for his role in the bombing of the African embassies in 1998, and is now serving a life sentence in a supermax prison in Colorado. And I bet most of your viewers have never heard of him. So it's not entirely true that no detainees have ever come to the United States. But the vast majority, as you said, have been sent to third countries, typically their country of origin or a closely related country.
• Well, the Trump administration closed what was called the Guantanamo transfer office, the Guantanamo closure office, which was an office in the Department of State that was responsible for finding places for the detainees to go. So that was closed four years ago. There were actually an effort by a number of the detainees to try and get it out of the door in January of 2017 before it was deemed too late. So I think one of the major things divide the administration has to do in order to essentially make good on President Barack Obama's promise to close Guantanamo and to sort of resolve that unfinished business is to reopen the Guantanamo closure office who will spearhead the efforts to find a place for those six individuals who are currently cleared to go, as well as other individuals who are likely to be cleared in the years to come.
• Absolutely. The hard cost, just in dollar terms for detaining the detainees is $13 million a year each. So this is the most expensive gated community in the Caribbean you've ever heard of. But the soft costs are astronomical. They are costs to our diplomatic credibility around the world, there are costs to our ability to cooperate with allies in warfighting efforts. There are a lot of countries who actually now traditional allies in Europe, for example, who now have to think twice before interacting with the United States on a, on defense objectives because of the risk, for example, of individuals being sent to Guantanamo. I think there's also a cost here at home. I don't think you can see children in cages on the southern border if we hadn't in some way or another created the legal and social infrastructure of seeing men in cages in Guantanamo a few years before that. Guantanamo is a place that, from its very inception was designed to be a place where people were not people. And once you start creating a legal regime around the idea that there are people who have no rights at all, they are merely objects, it's very easy for that to spill over into all aspects of American society, whether or not it's the tactics used in policing, whether or not it's the treatment of immigrants at the border or near the border, the treatment of refugees. Very quickly, the law of Guantanamo has become infected in a way, has infected the law of the United States.
• It's not just an opportunity, it's a primary recruiting tool. There is a long tradition going back to the 1950s of radical Muslim terrorists using the imprisoned, essentially political prisoners, as their primary recruiting tool. And Guantanamo has been the most spectacular example of that around the world. There's a reason, thinking back only a few years to when ISIS was doing horrible things on the news every night, there's a reason that ISIS put men in orange jumpsuits before burning them alive or beheading them because they were making it a moral equivalence to Guantanamo, a moral equivalence that I certainly would object to, and I'm sure you would. But a moral equivalence that can probably seem fairly appealing to a lot of people around the world, particularly people who might be ambivalent about whether or not the United States is still the, the shining city on the hill that they always believed it to be.
• Sure. So the easiest, most tried and true way to bring people to justice, such as the five men charged for perpetrating the attacks of September 11th, are the federal courts. Eric Holder, when he became the attorney general back in 2009, put together a plan to prosecute all of the 9/11 conspirators in a federal court. And people at the time, I remember, balked at the idea that it could possibly cost $100 million to do that. We spend that every year in Guantanamo. So if it's if it's simply a matter of cost where we are acting irrationally in Guantanamo. So you could bring the people who need to be charged for serious crimes, including 9/11, solve those, resolve those cases, definitively resolve them, credibly resolve them publicly in New York City. You could do that very easily in federal courts. The federal courts have a sterling track record of not only convicting people in terrorism cases, but of giving them extremely stiff sentences very easily. Under the federal sentencing guidelines, anyone charged with the terrorism offense gets a minimum of 17 years. So it would, the federal courts are there and open. So for the people who need to be charged, you can try them in a federal court for the other detainees, the detainee population.
• Certainly during the Obama administration, there became this, I would call it, a faux machismo around the war on terrorism that you saw former President Trump often play up, ""the Guantanamo. We're going to fill it with bad dudes."" To seem tough on terrorism on TV, you would say you're in favor of Guantanamo when in reality it's the softest thing you can do to respond to the threat of terrorism. So I think that's a big part of it. Politics has played a tremendous part in making Guantanamo as dysfunctional as it is. I think there are also vested interests inside, not so much the Department of Defense, but a much lower level. As we're conducting this interview, yesterday, as something of a parting shot an outgoing Trump official charged three more men in the military commissions in Guantanamo. By all accounts and by all measures only to complicate Secretary Austin's ability to make good on his promise to the Congress that he was going to really make an initiative to close Guantanamo. There is a kind of political and legal vandalism that Guantanamo has attracted. And the, and that's just something that's made it an incredibly intractable problem for a number of years.
• I wouldn't put my money on it, to be perfectly candid. These men have been in Guantanamo or at least in US custody since, I think, 2003. They have been theoretical targets for prosecution since 2010 without any action by either the the Obama or Trump administrations in that direction. It's only, again, this parting shot by an official sort of very deep down in the Department of Defense. But to give you a measure of how any trial might go, the 9/11 conspirators, the five 9/11 conspirators have been facing trial since 2008. There's no trial date set yet. They're not looking to actually have a trial in that case, probably for years and maybe never. The one, the only thing that has been true about the military commissions, which are these tribunals created in Guantanamo, has been that they are dysfunctional. They are constantly beset by errors and and issues that would never occur in the federal court. To give you just one example, in the 9/11 case, I think they've now had six judges in the past two years. And you can't blame all of that dysfunction on the COVID-19 pandemic. The only thing that has been unflagging, true about the military commissions is delay and one thing after another, whether it's the six judges now in the past two years in the 9/11 case, whether it's judges in some of the other cases who were actually applying for jobs secretly with the government and therefore required the Court of Appeals to throw out years of their proceedings on the grounds of essentially judicial corruption — one thing after another has made these, sort of, these trials into a 'Waiting for Godot' experience. They're the trials that everyone's waiting for but never come. And these three Indonesians, if, assuming the Biden administration doesn't take fairly rapid steps to to pull back that order to prosecute them, they're going to be in some form of rope-a-dope trial process for the next decade. And I think it's really just a startling feature of Guantanamo and the military commissions that we actually are having fairly realistic conversations about the 9/11 case not actually being resolved until the people who were not yet born on September 11th are approaching middle age. And I think that's, that's a tragedy. That's a deep tragedy for this country. It's a tragedy for the victims. I live in New York. It's a tragedy for all New Yorkers who still every time, you know, if you're of a certain age like I am, every time you see the Freedom Tower, you're reminded of the two towers that aren't there anymore. And it's a scar on our country that has yet to heal. And Guantanamo is the primary reason that scar continues to fester.",Obama wanted to close Gitmo. Will Biden be able to finally do it?,www.pbs.org
63,64,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/diversity-tied-to-economy-rahul-gandhi/cid/1804614,"Rahul Gandhi on Saturday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s poor understanding of the importance of diversity in India, arguing that economic growth was not possible without social harmony.

In a conversation with representatives from the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector in Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore, the Congress leader said the economic slide began much before the pandemic struck, citing as reasons the demonetisation and the faulty GST rollout apart from the atmosphere of social disharmony which is not conducive for business. “You cannot have disharmony and economic growth together,” he said.

Responding to a question about the “role of diversity”, Rahul said: “What will happen if somebody says you can’t speak Tamil? What will happen if somebody goes to Manipur and says you cannot follow your customs? Economic activities will cease. The foundation of economic growth in India is diversity. Without diversity, you won’t have economy. You won’t have India either. India itself is an idea of diversity.”

The Congress MP explained: “The notion that the Prime Minister has that he can reduce diversity and grow faster is ignorance. It is lack of understanding. Also, lack of respect. When I come to Tamil Nadu, I view your language, your culture, your tradition as an asset. The current dispensation views this as a liability. They believe power should be centralised, that one man and one organisation should control everything.”

Insisting that social harmony is an imperative for business, Rahul said: “You can see the Prime Minister came with huge announcements. What happened? What has happened to the economy, what has happened to the level of violence in the society, what has happened to creation of jobs? Harmony is the central thing. The current government has created a huge amount of disharmony.”

Rahul was asked about the frequent protests in the country. He replied: “Protests are happening because there is an attempt to impose one idea, one ideology, to force this country to do what it doesn’t want to do. There is an attempt to capture institutions… we are heading in a dictatorial direction.

“Instead of conversations about how to solve problems, the government thinks it can impose its views. They will soon find out this is not possible. Farmers are not listening. Tamil Nadu has questions, the Northeast has questions…. It is about style of governance. You have to talk to people with respect, kindness, love and affection.”

Claiming that the GST was not a case of faulty implementation alone as it was designed to harm small businesses, Rahul said: “The government’s entire focus is on the largest players while the need of the hour is to do hand-holding of MSMEs, which is the future. We can’t compete with China without empowering the MSMEs. You talk of ‘Make in India, five big industrialists are there. Talk of telecom, defence… and the same five fellows. Now agriculture, the same people. Banks are working for 10-15 big industrialists,” Rahul said.

Participants bitterly complained about the GST and the economic slide, lamenting that over 30 per cent of micro industrial units had died during the lockdown, affecting over 20 crore people.

Later in the evening, interacting with industrial workers in Tirupur, Rahul alleged that the demonetisation and the faulty GST rollout were not mistakes but done on purpose to break the backbone of India’s workers and small businesses. This was a systemic and organised assault on workers, Rahul said, adding that even the inadequate response to Covid-19 was on purpose and now farmers were facing a similar fate.

“Modi is an arrogant person. He does not understand the power of poor people. Our job is to make him understand the power of the poor. I can sense you don’t believe the nonsense that the Prime Minister speaks,” Rahul said.

On a question about joblessness, he said: “This is because the economy is stuck, like the traffic that doesn’t move in a jam. This has happened because Modi gave thousands of crores to 10-15 largest businessmen and waived those loans instead of taking the money back.”",Diversity tied to economy: Rahul Gandhi,www.telegraphindia.com

The same flight later returned to Delhi with 21 fliers on board.

Sikkim’s health minister M.K. Sharma and senior officials of the state’s tourism and civil aviation department were present at the Himalayan state’s lone airport in Pakyong town near capital Gangtok to welcome the fliers with the traditional khadas or ceremonial scarves.

Fliers who to spoke reporters at the airport said the flight had been comfortable and they enjoyed the trip. “The birds’-eye view of the mountains was good. The airport is also very good and we were given a great welcome,” smiled one of them, pointing to a yellow khada draped around his neck.

Flier Arun Upadhyaya, a doctor from Agra in Uttar Pradesh, said he was on a five-day trip to Sikkim and was looking forward to explore the place that he was visiting for the first time.

“I will go sightseeing and meet the people of the state. I want to see the local culture and tradition,” he said.

Sikkim chief minister P.S. Tamang (Golay) said he believed that the resumption of flights would be the start of a new era of travel in Sikkim.

He added that the flights will help in mitigating issues faced by the state in terms of transport. “I also believe that this will be a big boost for the tourism sector in Sikkim in years to come,” added the chief minister.

J. Jayakumar, the additional chief secretary and head of the tourism and civil aviation department, said the resumption of commercial flights from Pakyong Airport was possible due to the combined efforts of Union ministry of civil aviation, the Airports Authority of India and the state government.

He added that talks were on with the Centre for introducing flights to popular destinations Kathmandu (Nepal), Thimphu (Bhutan) and Bangkok (Thailand) from Pakyong.

Among the fliers who took the return flight to Delhi was Reshmi Biswakarma, a local girl studying nursing in Himachal Pradesh. “This (introduction of Pakyong-Delhi flight) will help us immensely. For instance, my college has already started and taking this flight to Delhi will help me reach my college early,” Reshmi said.

The greenfield airport, built under the Centre’s regional connectivity scheme, UDAN, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2018. Commercial flight operations began at the airport on October 4, 2018. However, seven months later from June 2019 onwards, all operations were suspended because of teething problems, including unpredictable weather, poor visibility and lack of proper landing facility.",Flights resume at Pakyong Airport,www.telegraphindia.com

The protesting farmers on Saturday claimed a breakthrough in talks with police over finalising routes for the kisan parade on Republic Day amid indications from Delhi cops that the tractor rally would be allowed to enter the national capital, but there was no official confirmation.

The official announcement is expected to be made on Sunday once the final contours of the agreement are drawn up.

Delhi police sources said the tractor rally would be permitted after the main Republic Day parade but not in New Delhi and central Delhi areas.

The protesting farmers had always maintained that they only wanted to move along the Outer Ring Road, and not disrupt the main parade. From the day they announced their parade on January 2, the farmers have said that they would bring out their tractor rally only after the main parade is over.

Also, the police said the farmers would have to give a written undertaking about their programme before permission is granted. Delhi police have also told farmers that medical services will be provided to them on the designated routes.

Earlier, in a statement, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha — the banner under which the farmers’ protest against the new agriculture laws is being held — said: “In a breakthrough with police officials of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, SKM leaders were able to jointly finalise routes for the Kisan Republic Day Parade. Preparations are on in full swing for disciplined conduct of the same.”

Some farmer union leaders said the parade would be allowed to enter Delhi from five borders and move along a route designated by Delhi police without going on to the Outer Ring Road. Essentially, the farmers and the police have met halfway with the SKM giving up the insistence on going along the Outer Ring Road if the farmers are allowed to enter Delhi on Republic Day.

Yogendra Yadav of the Jai Kisan Andolan and Hannan Mollah of the All India Kisan Sabha — both constituents of the SKM — said there was broad agreement on the routes and they would be made public on Sunday. The police have said the barricades at the border points to Delhi will be removed, Mollah added.

Since the Supreme Court earlier this week refused to step in to take a decision on the farmers’ proposed parade, Delhi police have been in regular contact with the SKM leadership. The police at first tried to persuade the farmers to give up their plan to enter Delhi, taking the plea that the security set-up will be as it is strained on January 26 owing to Republic Day events.

Farmers, too, have been working overtime to not only make their parade a success but also ensure that it remains peaceful. The SKM has made it clear that only the national flag and flags of the various farmer unions can be placed on the tractors, strictly barring flags of political parties. Further, they are dissuading participants from trying out stunts during the parade.

Going by videos flooding social media and intelligence reports received by the security agencies, the participation for the parade is likely to be even more than anticipated.

The highways leading to Delhi from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are already witnessing a steady stream of bedecked tractors heading for Delhi.",Farmers' protest: Republic Day tractor parade plan inches forward,www.telegraphindia.com
66,67,https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/narendra-modi-ties-netajis-vision-to-government-slogans/cid/1804609,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday strenuously attempted to associate the vision of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose with the “achievements” of his government, steering clear of the secular hero’s inclusive philosophy.

Quoting Netaji repeatedly in laboured Bengali, the Prime Minister allowed saffron to paint what was to be an apolitical event of the ministry of culture at the Victoria Memorial Hall lawns on Saturday, not unlike his January 12, 2020 address at Belur Math, where Modi had used the occasion of Swami Vivekananda’s birth anniversary to defend the controversial amended citizenship law.

Modi — in the presence of chief minister Mamata Banerjee — went to the extent of raising his party’s pitch for its Assembly poll campaign, urging people in the name of Netaji and his legacy not to rest till “Sonar Bangla” was achieved.

“Netaji Subhas, along with Atmanirbhar Bharat, is the greatest inspiration for Sonar Bangla. The role he played towards India’s Independence, Bengal must play that role in Atmanirbhar Bharat…. Bengal must come forward, add to its own glory, and that of the nation. Like Netaji, we must also not stop till we achieve the goals we have set for ourselves,” he said, towards the end of what virtually became a BJP campaign speech.

Modi’s speech was replete with attempts to underscore Netaji’s Hindu background — such as references to how Netaji supposedly carried a copy of the Bhagvad Gita with him, how he sent a niece to seek blessings for his mission from the Dakshineswar Kali Temple — while keeping mum on the icon’s secular, tolerant, humanist worldview.

Referring to Netaji’s request to nephew Sisir Kumar Bose — “Amar ekta kaj kortey parbey (Can you carry out a task for me)?” — for help with the historic escape from under British surveillance from his Elgin Road residence in January 1941, which paved the way for his epic transcontinental war effort for India’s Independence, Modi launched into a series of associations between Netaji’s aspirations and the things attempted by the present central government.

“Today, if every Indian puts his hand to the chest and experiences Netaji once again, everyone would hear that (request to Netaji’s nephew)…. That task, that goal is of making Atmanirbhar Bharat…. There is no power in the world that can stop India from achieving Atmanirbhar Bharat,” Modi said.

“It pleases me that this country now is working tirelessly for the empowerment of the downtrodden, the exploited, farmers, women…. Today, every poor person is getting help for healthcare (apparent reference to Ayushman Bharat),” he added. “Farmers of the nation, from seeds to the markets, are being given modern aid...what they spend on agriculture, there are efforts underway to reduce that (apparent reference to the contentious farm laws),” he added.

Adding the National Education Policy and even the acquisition of Rafale aircraft to the mix of things that, according to Modi, would have pleased Netaji, he broached the subject — albeit only in passing — to the conflicts with Pakistan and China.

“Netaji is watching us, blessing us, loving us… the strong India he had imagined, today from the LAC to the LoC, that is the avatar of India that the world is watching. From wherever there is an attempt to challenge India’s sovereignty, today, this country responds fittingly,” said the Prime Minister.

Modi, who in his very first year as premier, decided to replace Planning Commission envisioned by Netaji with the NITI Aayog, attributed to the icon his government’s propensity to commit to contentious policies despite opposition. “Something Netaji said that influences me, the relentless effort to achieve your own goal…. He taught me that if some idea is not simple, not common, has difficulties, despite that, there should be no fear in trying out something new...”

“If you believe in something, you have to show the courage of starting it. It might seem that you are going against the tide. But if your goal is pure, there should be no hesitation,” he said.",Modi ties Netaji’s vision to govt slogans,www.telegraphindia.com
67,68,https://wiky.com/2021/01/23/scottish-nationalists-lay-groundwork-for-second-independence-referendum/,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Scottish National Party published a ""Roadmap to Referendum"" on Saturday, laying out plans for another vote on Scottish independence just as the United Kingdom grapples with COVID-19 and the impact of Brexit.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who would have to agree to a new referendum, argues there is no need for a new vote after independence was rejected by Scottish voters in 2014.

But the SNP has said that if it wins a parliamentary majority at elections scheduled for May 6, it will pass its own bill so that a referendum can take place once the pandemic is over.

It says that the UK government will either have to agree to it or take legal action to dispute the legal basis of the referendum.

""Such a legal challenge would be vigorously opposed by an SNP Scottish government,"" said the document, dated Jan. 24.

Polls show that Scottish nationalists are on course to win a record majority in elections for Scotland's devolved parliament.

Scots voted 55-45% against independence in a referendum in 2014, but Brexit and the British government's handling of the COVID-19 crisis have bolstered support for the SNP, with most polls showing a majority now favour breaking away.

A poll published on The Times website on Saturday showed another potential threat to the future of the UK, with 51% of Northern Irish voters saying they favoured a referendum about their future within the next five years, compared to 44% who oppose it.

Support for a United Ireland stands at 42% according to the polls, versus 47% who object to Northern Ireland leaving the UK.",Scottish nationalists lay groundwork for second independence referendum,wiky.com

[ Editor’s Note: This is a totally baloney Saudi Foreign Minister report, crying crocodile tears about the poor Mideast situation. We are asked to believe that its autocratic regime that crushes all dissent is open to a fair resolution to anything.

Such a concept does not inhabit Saudi Royal DNA. What would be the point of being Royal? Think of its war crimes against Yemen and how easily the Royals take that in stride.

The first main goal with the Saudi FM is to get SA into a veto position over any ‘resolution’, or work with the US in an endless, going nowhere, fake diplomatic attempt where its failure is always blamed on others, the standard ploy in Mideast failed negotiations.

The second is to try to fool Biden that he is a member of the team, when Saudi Arabia is already a member of the Israeli team, and Israel only joins any team to be in a position of steering them were it wants.

They know Biden will want to look like he is the peacemaker-in-chief, and will play him on that, for his wanting to think that he might pull a peace deal off, while getting as much out of the US as possible in the process, only to leave the bride at the altar, again.

So Mideast talks will continue to be initiated with the caveat of everyone wanting their own marked deck of cards be the one used. We have all been here before… Jim W. Dean ]

Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister has said Riyadh stands ready for rapprochement with Iran, but claimed that the Islamic Republic does not commit itself to de-escalating tensions.

Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran in January 2016 following angry protests outside its embassy in Tehran over Riyadh’s execution of a prominent cleric. Ever since, the country has followed a hostile policy which intensified in line with former US president Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” on Tehran.

In an interview with Al Arabiya TV channel, however, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud alleged that Tehran is “not serious about talks with Riyadh”.

“Our hands are outstretched for peace with Iran, but it does not commit itself to agreements,” he said.

The remarks came two days after Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif welcomed his Qatari counterpart’s call for the Persian Gulf Arab countries to hold talks with Iran, saying Tehran has long demanded neighborly cooperation towards establishing a strong Middle East.

Tehran has on many occasions announced its readiness to hold talks with its neighbors directly. It has already put forward an initiative called the Hormuz Peace Endeavor (HOPE) to promote security in the Persian Gulf and facilitate such neighborly negotiations.

Prince Faisal claimed that Iran’s “calls for dialogue are meant to divert attention away from its own crises”.

Riyadh acted as one of the main forces behind Washington’s 2018 withdrawal from the 2015 landmark nuclear deal with Tehran, after which the US returned its draconian sanctions against Tehran.

Commenting on the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the top Saudi diplomat claimed that new US President Joe Biden had pledged to include Persian Gulf allies and Israel in any future talks that focused on Iran’s nuclear program as well as its missiles and regional role.

The JCPOA was “weak” because there was a lack of coordination with the countries in the region, Prince Faisal said.

“We will consult with the US regarding the agreement so that it will be a strong basis,” he added. “The European countries understand that the previous agreement with Tehran has flaws.”

Iran has categorically dismissed negotiating the nuclear deal with the regional countries. Tehran has also rejected any renegotiation of the JCPOA, saying the US must lift the sanctions before returning to the nuclear deal.

Elsewhere in his interview, the top Saudi diplomat indicated his country’s readiness to reach a political solution on Yemen, but threw the ball in Houthis’ court.

“The Houthis will facilitate reaching a solution if they decide that the interest of Yemen is the most important,” Prince Faisal said.

The conciliatory remarks come as Yemeni forces, including Houthi fighters, are going from strength to strength against the Saudi-led invaders.

Riyadh is additionally worried by the exit of the Trump administration which was a staunch supporter of the kingdom and its war on Yemen.

Biden pledged in his campaign to reassess ties with the kingdom, demanding more accountability over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Riyadh’s Istanbul consulate and calling for an end to US support for the Yemen war.

The Saudi foreign minister, nevertheless, voiced optimism that relations with the United States would be “excellent” under Biden.

“The Biden administration will see that we have common goals with regards to the situation in Yemen,” he said.

A spokesperson at the US State Department said Friday Washington has started a review of a decision by the Trump administration to designate Yemen’s popular Houthi Ansarullah movement as a foreign terrorist organization.

Prince Faisal, however, defended the blacklisting, saying it was “justified”.

Saudi Arabia launched a devastating military aggression against Yemen in March 2015 in collaboration with a number of its allied states, and with arms and logistics support from the US and several Western countries.

The aim was to return to power a Riyadh-backed former regime and defeat the popular Houthi Ansarullah movement that has been running state affairs in the absence of an effective government in the Arab country.

The Saudi war has failed to achieve its goals, but killed tens of thousands of innocent Yemenis and destroyed the impoverished country’s infrastructure.

According to Channel 12, Netanyahu is looking to cut the number of Israelis returning from abroad for fear of new, highly infections coronavirus strains.

Action will reportedly be taken within the coming 24 hours, with even those who have already received two vaccine shots reportedly set to be unable to leave for tourism.

In the meantime, Channel 13 reported that the Health Ministry is looking to set up digital surveillance over Israelis returning from abroad.

Contrasting reports paint a vague picture of when the travel ban could end, with sources cited as expecting it to remain in place for at least several weeks.

During discussions, it was requested that Israel’s skies be reopened only after five million Israelis have received the vaccine. However, the ministry understands that it will take approximately six weeks to reach that number, and keeping the skies closed harms the economy. Therefore, the ministry has requested to renew electronic tracking of those arriving in Israel.

The new British and South African coronavirus mutations reportedly account for 40% of new infections in Israel and are partly responsible for the high morbidity rate, despite the general containment in force for several weeks.

Prosecutors asked a judge on Friday to keep the man, Garret Miller, in jail ahead of a court appearance, according to court records. They revealed five criminal charges in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia against Miller on Wednesday, including for making death threats and trespassing offenses.

Images of social media posts allegedly authored by Miller, which appear to announce his trip to the Capitol and threaten the life of Ocasio-Cortez as well as a Capitol Police officer, are cited in the court filing.

Prosecutors said Miller made numerous threatening remarks online, including one instance in which he commented “next time we bring the guns” on a Twitter video showing rioters exiting a Capitol building.

As rioters broke into the Capitol, Ocasio-Cortez worried that her colleagues in Congress might divulge her location to the mob, putting her at risk for kidnapping or worse, according to an Instagram Live video she recorded on Jan. 12.

Ocasio-Cortez also said she experienced “a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die” on Jan. 6, adding that she could not get into specifics for security reasons, according to a Washington Post account of the video. “I did not know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive.”

74,75,https://www.997wtn.com/news/customer-leaves-covid-sucks-message-and-a-1400-tip-at-a-colorado-restaurant/,"After a big breakfast at a Colorado restaurant, a generous customer left employees a $1,400 tip and a message that said “COVID Sucks!”

Notchtop Bakery & Cafe owner Nailya Khametvalieva says the patron, who she only identified as David, came into her Estes Park eatery on Wednesday for some eggs, bacon, sausage and biscuits and gravy.

When it came time to pay the $20.04 check, David asked his server how many people were working that day.

He ended up leaving the $1,400 tip with instructions to give each of the seven employees $200.

“That brought truly tears to all the servers [and] cooks — you know, nobody ever thinks of cooks — the cooks were just so surprised and shocked. We were all shocked,” Khametvalieva said. “We did thank him, but I felt like we didn’t do it enough.”

She said David lives in the area, but it was only the second time he’s been to the restaurant.

Gloria Fuentes waited on David both times he came in and told CNN affiliate KMGH that she couldn’t believe it when she saw the bill.

“I was like ‘Oh my God, am I dreaming or what’s going on?'” Fuentes told KMGH.

Another server tolkd KMGH that the money would be a big help to her family.

“It’s $200 to me, but it’s also $200 for my husband. It’s also $200 for my daughters, for things that we needed to make it,” Jayme Johnson said.

Khametvalieva never closed the restaurant that she’s run for almost 10 years because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but said business has been tough. Last year’s wildfires also added to the challenge.

She said she’s been able to give all of her employees hours and also got a PPP loan.

Estes Park is about 70 miles outside of Denver, and Khametvalieva says she gets a lot of business in the summer from out-of-state tourists.

She said many of those customers have bought gift cards to support the restaurant, since they haven’t been able to come in person.

75,76,https://krdo.com/news/2021/01/23/schumer-trump-impeachment-trial-to-begin-week-of-feb-8/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trial for Donald Trump over the Capitol riot will begin the week of Feb. 8, the first time a former president will face such charges after leaving office.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced the schedule Friday evening after reaching an agreement with Republicans, who had pushed for a delay to give Trump a chance to organize his legal team and prepare a defense on the sole charge of incitement of insurrection.

The February start date also allows the Senate more time to confirm President Joe Biden’s Cabinet nominations and consider his proposed $1.9 trillion COVID relief package — top priorities of the new White House agenda that could become stalled during trial proceedings.

“We all want to put this awful chapter in our nation’s history behind us,” Schumer said about the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol siege by a mob of pro-Trump supporters.

“But healing and unity will only come if there is truth and accountability. And that is what this trial will provide.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment late Monday, with senators sworn in as jurors Tuesday. But opening arguments will move to February.

Trump’s impeachment trial would be the first of a U.S. president no longer in office, an undertaking that his Senate Republican allies argue is pointless, and potentially even unconstitutional. Democrats say they have to hold Trump to account, even as they pursue Biden’s legislative priorities, because of the gravity of what took place — a violent attack on the U.S. Congress aimed at overturning an election.

If Trump is convicted, the Senate could vote to bar him from holding office ever again, potentially upending his chances for a political comeback.

The urgency for Democrats to hold Trump responsible was complicated by the need to put Biden’s government in place and start quick work on his coronavirus aid package.

“The more time we have to get up and running ... the better,” Biden said Friday in brief comments to reporters.

Republicans were eager to delay the trial, putting distance between the shocking events of the siege and the votes that will test their loyalty to the former president who still commands voters’ attention.

Negotiations between Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell were complicated, as the two are also in talks over a power-sharing agreement for the Senate, which is split 50-50 but in Democratic control because Vice President Kamala Harris serves as a tie-breaking vote.

McConnell had proposed delaying the start and welcomed the agreement.

“Republicans set out to ensure the Senate’s next steps will respect former President Trump’s rights and due process, the institution of the Senate, and the office of the presidency,” said McConnell spokesman Doug Andres. “That goal has been achieved.”

Pelosi said Friday the nine House impeachment managers, or prosecutors, are “ready to begin to make their case” against Trump. Trump’s team will have had the same amount of time since the House impeachment vote to prepare, Pelosi said.

Democrats say they can move quickly through the trial, potentially with no witnesses, because lawmakers experienced the insurrection first-hand.

One of the managers, California Rep. Ted Lieu, said Friday that Democrats would rather be working on policy right now, but “we can’t just ignore” what happened on Jan. 6.

“This was an attack on our Capitol by a violent mob,” Lieu said in an interview with The Associated Press. “It was an attack on our nation instigated by our commander in chief. We have to address that and make sure it never happens again.”

Trump, who told his supporters to “fight like hell” just before they invaded the Capitol two weeks ago and interrupted the electoral vote count, is still assembling his legal team.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday deferred to Congress on timing for the trial and would not say whether Biden thinks Trump should be convicted. But she said lawmakers can simultaneously discuss and have hearings on Biden’s coronavirus relief package.

“We don’t think it can be delayed or it can wait, so they’re going to have to find a path forward,” Psaki said of the virus aid. “He’s confident they can do that.”

Democrats would need the support of at least 17 Republicans to convict Trump, a high bar. While most Republican senators condemned Trump’s actions that day, far fewer appear to be ready to convict.

A handful of Senate Republicans have indicated they are open — but not committed — to conviction. But most have come to Trump’s defense as it relates to impeachment, saying they believe a trial will be divisive and questioning the legality of trying a president after he has left office.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally who has been helping him find lawyers, said Friday there is “a very compelling constitutional case” on whether Trump can be impeached after his term — an assertion Democrats reject, saying there is ample legal precedent. Graham also suggested Republicans will argue Trump’s words on Jan. 6 were not legally “incitement.”

“On the facts, they’ll be able to mount a defense, so the main thing is to give him a chance to prepare and run the trial orderly, and hopefully the Senate will reject the idea of pursuing presidents after they leave office,” Graham said.

Other Republicans had stronger words, suggesting there should be no trial at all. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso said Pelosi is sending a message to Biden that “my hatred and vitriol of Donald Trump is so strong that I will stop even you and your Cabinet from getting anything done.” Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson suggested Democrats are choosing “vindictiveness” over national security as Biden attempts to set up his government.

McConnell, who said this week that Trump “provoked” his supporters before the riot, has not said how he will vote. He said Senate Republicans “strongly believe we need a full and fair process where the former president can mount a defense and the Senate can properly consider the factual, legal and constitutional questions.”

Trump, the first president to be impeached twice, is at a disadvantage compared with his first impeachment trial, in which he had the full resources of the White House counsel’s office to defend him. Graham helped Trump hire South Carolina attorney Butch Bowers after members of his past legal teams indicated they did not plan to join the new effort.",Schumer: Trump impeachment trial to begin week of Feb. 8,krdo.com

The beloved host died on Saturday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles, reported Fox News. The news of Larry's demise was confirmed by a statement posted online by his company, Ora Media on the late star's official Twitter handle.

The statement read, ""With profound sadness, Ora Media announces the death of our co-founder, host, and friend Larry King, who passed away this morning at age 87 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.""

""For 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry's many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster. Additionally, while it was his name appearing in the shows' titles, Larry always viewed his interview subjects as the true stars of his programs, and himself as merely an unbiased conduit between the guest and audience. Whether he was interviewing a U.S. president, foreign leader, celebrity, scandal-ridden personage, or an everyman, Larry liked to ask short, direct, and uncomplicated questions. He believed concise questions usually provided the best answers, and he was not wrong in that belief.""

""Larry's interviews from his 25-year run on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" and his Ora Media programs ""Larry King Now,"" and ""Politicking with Larry King"" are consistently referenced by media outlets around the world and remain part of the historical record of the late 20th and early 21st centuries,"" the statement said.

Along with details about Larry's life and condolences for his family, the statement further revealed that the funeral and memorial services will be announced later in co-ordination with the King family, who for now have asked for privacy at this time of grief.

""We mourn the passing of our colleague Larry King,"" CNN President Jeff Zucker said in a statement.

""The scrappy young man from Brooklyn had a history-making career spanning radio and television. His curiosity about the world propelled his award-winning career in broadcasting, but it was his generosity of spirit that drew the world to him. We are so proud of the 25 years he spent with CNN, where his newsmaker interviews truly put the network on the international stage. From our CNN family to Larry's, we send our thoughts and prayers, and a promise to carry on his curiosity for the world in our work,"" the statement said.

Larry had reportedly been admitted to a hospital earlier this month after he was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus. His death comes after years of health problems that plagued the late star including his battles with lung and prostate cancer.

In a career spanning over six decades, Larry interviewed a staggering number of celebrities, political leaders, and public figures, including every US president from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump.

Over the years, Larry fathered five children and welcomed nine grandchildren, along with four great-grandchildren. The legendary host suffered a terrible tragedy last year when two of his children, daughter Chaia King and son Andy King, both died within three weeks of each other unexpectedly over the summer.

79,80,https://www.dudleynews.co.uk/news/national/19034217.2-600-arrested-protesters-across-russia-demand-navalnys-release/,"More than 2,600 people have been arrested after protests erupted in at least 60 Russian cities to demand the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin’s most prominent foe.

The protests, which took place in temperatures as low as minus 50C in some place, highlighted how Navalny’s influence stretches far beyond the political and cultural centres of Moscow and St Petersburg.

In Moscow, an estimated 15,000 protesters gathered in and around Pushkin Square in the city centre, where clashes with police broke out and demonstrators were dragged off by riot officers to police buses and detention trucks. Some activists were beaten with police batons.

Navalny’s wife Yulia was among those arrested.

Police eventually pushed demonstrators out of the square. Thousands then regrouped along a wide boulevard about half a mile away, many of them throwing snowballs at the police before dispersing.

Some demonstrators later went to protest near the jail where Navalny is being held. Police made an undetermined number of arrests there.

The protests stretched across Russia’s vast territory, from the island city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk north of Japan and the eastern Siberian city of Yakutsk, where temperatures plunged to minus 50C, to the more populous European cities.

The range demonstrated how Navalny and his anti-corruption campaign have built an extensive network of support despite official government repression and being routinely ignored by state media.

The OVD-Info group, which monitors political arrests, said at least 1,045 people were detained in Moscow and more than 375 at another large demonstration in St Petersburg.

Overall, it said 2,662 people had been arrested in some 90 cities, revising the count downward from its earlier report of 3,445. The group, which conducts its count through regional associates and runs a hotline for information, did not give an explanation for its revision, and Russian police did not provide arrest figures.

Undeterred, Navalny’s supporters have called for fresh protests next weekend.

Navalny was arrested on January 17 when he returned to Moscow from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a severe nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin, and which Russian authorities deny.

Authorities say his stay in Germany violated terms of a suspended sentence in a 2014 criminal conviction, while Navalny says the conviction was for made-up charges.

The 44-year-old activist is well known nationally for his reports on the corruption that has flourished under President Vladimir Putin’s government.

His wide support puts the Kremlin in a strategic bind — risking more protests and criticism from the West if it keeps him in custody, but apparently unwilling to back down by letting him go free.

In a statement, the US state department condemned “the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists this weekend in cities throughout Russia” and called on Russian authorities to immediately release Navalny and all those detained at protests.

Navalny faces a court hearing in early February to determine whether his sentence in the criminal case for fraud and money-laundering – which Navalny says was politically motivated – is converted to three and a half years behind bars.

On Thursday, Moscow police arrested three top Navalny associates, two of whom were later jailed for periods of nine and 10 days.

Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on August 20.

He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.

Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning.

Russia refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned.

Last month, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up.

The FSB dismissed the recording as fake.

Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side for a decade, unusually durable in an opposition movement often demoralised by repressions.

He has been jailed repeatedly in connection with protests and twice was convicted of financial misdeeds in cases that he said were politically motivated.

He suffered significant eye damage when an assailant threw disinfectant into his face. He was taken from jail to a hospital in 2019 with an illness that authorities said was an allergic reaction but which many suspected was a poisoning.","More than 2,600 arrested as protesters across Russia demand Navalny’s release",www.dudleynews.co.uk
80,81,https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/adf-cases-reveal-culture-of-bullying-abuse/4184478/,"Bullying, bashings, naked romps and acts of indecency - just another day in the military court of the Australian Defence Force.

The outcomes of the ADF Superior Service Tribunal proceedings for 2020 paint a disturbing pattern of cases across all three military services, including some which have inflicted life-changing physical and mental injuries.

The court martial results have seen troops stripped of rank, fined and dismissed for offences that in some cases in a civilian court may well have attracted more significant penalties and jail time.

In one case, a hazing initiation ritual saw a young soldier kidnapped and cable-tied then chased into the night by men barking like dogs, while in another a soldier had to skol a drink or be given a ""kick to the testicles"".

That soldier who wouldn't skol was kicked so hard by RAAF corporal Brendan Storer, doctors considered having to remove one testicle. Instead he endured multiple medical procedures to change nerves.

""The injury has been life-changing,"" the court declared in finding the corporal guilty and sentencing him to a demotion and 40 days in a military jail.

In another case, an Australian Defence Force Academy officer cadet Daniel Igoe filmed a threesome sex act with a female and male colleague only to share the explicit looping video with others on Snapchat. He was spared jail but was booted out of the ADF.

Captain William Howieson, on a posting to Papua New Guinea, was charged with prejudicial conduct after telling a local female captain he had been ordered to provide a semen sample and asking her to help, while Army Major Kane Dalton faked papers and dressed to pretend he was a Lieutenant Colonel.

RAAF Flight Officer Rebecca Gabriela Hall was able to serve in the military for three years before it was discovered she had used a maiden name to enter the service, despite five years earlier being deemed unfit to join due to a medical condition when she applied under her married name. She was found guilty and escaped imprisonment but was still dismissed from service.

Deakin University Law School professor and recognised military law expert Matthew Groves said the military justice system had long been dogged by Constitutional doubts, culminating in the 2009 declaration as such by the High Court.

But since then legislative design reforms and greater transparency have led to a settling in the debate over operations and existence.

""Part of the paradox of all of this is that there are some things that are treated more severely in the military system and others that are not,"" Professor Groves said.

""In one sense it is like every profession, if you are a doctor and give drugs of dependence to somebody you know has a problem that is a strike-off offence because wrongly prescribing is a big thing, but if you write a dud cheque as a doctor people would say you shouldn't do that … every profession has its own quirks and deals with things differently and like the old (military) saying 'things are different in every walk of life but in the military they are very, very different'.""

Prof Groves said the community might consider being kicked out of a profession insufficient punishment but was devastating for a military person, from which some never recover.

He said some cases can go to civilian courts but how and who in Defence makes that decision is an ""obscure"" part of the system.

In the financial year to 2019, there were 1000 trials (Navy 162, Army 772 and Air Force 66) with Superior Tribunal trials (including court martials and Defence magistrate trials) accounting for an annual average of 30 hearings a year. Since March 2019 the military were prompted to publish cases publicly for transparency and general deterrence.","ADF cases reveal culture of bullying, abuse",www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au

Right-wing extremism has previously played out for the most part in isolated pockets of America and in its smaller cities. The deadly assault by rioters on the U.S. Capitol, in contrast, targeted the very heart of government.

""The events themselves, and participation in them, has a radicalizing effect. And they also have an inspirational effect. The battle of Capitol Hill is now part of the mythology,"" said Brian Michael Jenkins, a terrorism expert and senior adviser to the president of the RAND Corporation think tank.

Among those who participated in the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol were members of the Oath Keepers, which often recruits current and former military, police or other first responders; the Proud Boys neo-fascist group; followers of QAnon, which spreads bizarre conspiracy theories; racists and anti-Semites; and others with nearly blind devotion to then-President Donald Trump.

""January 6th was kind of a Woodstock of the angry right,"" Jenkins said in an interview. ""The mere fact those groups were coming together, mingling, sharing this anger, displaying this passion — it is going to have effects.""

Supposedly planned armed protests at all 50 state capitals and Washington this past week that the FBI issued a nationwide warning about drew virtually no one. That could indicate the groups are demoralized, at least temporarily.

Donald Trump is no longer president and his social media reach has been severely curtailed, with Twitter banning him. The extremists had come together in Washington on Jan. 6 because of their fervent belief in Trump's lies that the presidential election had been stolen, and in response to Trump's tweeted declaration that the protest in Washington ""will be wild.""

But now, some are clearly angry that Trump disassociated himself with the very insurrection that he stoked. They're upset that he failed to come to the rescue of rioters who were arrested while he was still president and are still being detained and charged.

""No pardons for middle class whites who risked their livelihoods by going to 'war' for Trump,"" a Telegram channel associated with the group said after Trump issued many pardons, but none for the insurrectionists.

""We gave it our all. Now we need to keep our chins up and go back to our lives as best we are able,"" Watkins wrote on Telegram after President Joe Biden was sworn in and Trump flew off to Florida.",Capitol attack reflects US extremist evolution over decades,www.wltx.com

84,85,https://www.srilankasource.com/news/267624725/roundup-cbot-agricultural-futures-in-correction,"CHICAGO, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- CBOT agricultural futures were in correction in the past week following weeks of rallies, Chicago-based research company AgResource noted.

Nevertheless, the Chicago company remains bullish on agricultural futures as the U.S. dollar declined on the growing prospect of a new U.S. COVID stimulus package with the U.S. Government debt pile to exceed 30 trillion dollars in the second quarter of 2021.

CBOT corn futures settled weaker for the first time in seven weeks. Fundamental input stays bullish as world cash feed markets rise and the U.S. corn remains the world's cheapest feed supply into summer. Yet, a technical correction was needed. AgResource holds that the recent break allowed a gap left open after the release of U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) January World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) being filled while finding support at short-term uptrend line. With weak longs being liquidated, the outlook remains bullish as there's no sign that U.S. corn demand is being rationed.

U.S. corn end stocks are projected to fall to 1.1 billion bushels as the USDA's export forecast is 200-300 million bushels too low. The longer-term concern remains historically low soil moisture across key parts of Central Brazil, where safrinha corn seeding begins in the next 45 days. The need for North Hemisphere acreage expansion and record yield in 2021 is sharply elevated. Current prices provide an opportunity for end users to extend forward coverage. AgResource are anticipating new rally highs in late winter/spring.

U.S. wheat futures ended lower in sympathy with corn's collapse on Friday. Some in the trade were disappointed that Russia will not place an outright quota on wheat exports during the spring months. However, Russia will leave its plan of taxing exports 1.65-dollar per bushel beginning March 15.

Amid Russia's looming export tax, the goal of Europe's market is to prevent a swelling of export demand and instead shift interest to North America. AgResource holds that USDA's U.S. 2020-2021 wheat export forecast is 30-50 million bushels too low.

The longer-term issue for wheat remains the need for trend/above trend North Hemisphere yields this spring. Otherwise, exporter stocks/use will tighten further. This will in turn mandate new highs in global cash markets. AgResource holds that strong support rests at 6.20-6.25 dollars for March wheat, and further breaks must be used to advance wheat & flour supply coverage.

After closing higher for 6 consecutive weeks, CBOT soybean reported its largest decline in 6.5 years. Fundamentally, there is no good reason for such a sizeable correction, AgResource noted. China continued to book both old and new crop soybeans, with announcements nearing 16 million bushels. Meanwhile, the weekly export sales report showed that U.S. exporters booked another 67 million bushels last week, pushing U.S. export commitments to 95 percent of the WASDE annual forecast. The U.S. soybean usage pace is record large and the break will encourage fresh demand into summer.

There is no sign that the U.S. soybean supply is being rationed in exports nor in domestic crush. Based on the record large export commitment figure, AgResource holds that USDA should raise the export forecast by 150-225 million bushels.

Initial support for spot futures will be found just below 13 dollars, and AgResource stays strongly bullish on soybean's outlook.",Roundup: CBOT agricultural futures in correction,www.srilankasource.com
85,86,https://www.metro.us/police-crack-down-on-2/,"MOSCOW (Reuters) – Police detained more than 3,000 people and used force to break up rallies across Russia on Saturday as tens of thousands of protesters ignored extreme cold and police warnings to demand the release of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.

Navalny had called on his supporters to protest after being arrested last weekend as he returned to Russia from Germany for the first time since being poisoned with a nerve agent he says was slipped to him by state security agents in August.

The authorities had warned people to stay away from Saturday’s demonstrations, saying they risked catching COVID-19 as well as prosecution and possible jail time for attending an unauthorised event.

But protesters defied the ban and, in at least one case in temperatures below -50 Celsius (-58 Fahrenheit), turned out in force. Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally, called on them to do the same next weekend to try to free Navalny from what he called “the clutches of his killers”.

In central Moscow, where Reuters reporters estimated up to 40,000 people had gathered in one of the biggest unauthorised rallies for years, police were seen roughly detaining people, bundling them into nearby vans.

The authorities said just some 4,000 people had shown up, while the foreign ministry questioned Reuters crowd estimate.

“Why not just immediately say 4 million?” it suggested sarcastically on its official Telegram messenger channel.

Ivan Zhdanov, a Navalny ally, put turnout in the capital at 50,000, the Proekt media outlet reported.

Some protesters chanted “Putin is a thief”, and “Disgrace” and “Freedom to Navalny!”

Navalny’s wife Yulia was briefly detained at the rally before being released. Some of Navalny’s political allies were detained in the days before the protest, others on the day itself.

At one point, protesters surrounded a sleek black car with a flashing light used by senior officials, throwing snowballs at it and kicking it. A group of policemen were also pelted with snowballs by a much bigger crowd.

The OVD-Info protest monitor group said that 3,435 people, including 1,360 in Moscow and 523 in St. Petersburg, had been detained at rallies in around 100 towns and cities.

The United States condemned what it described as “harsh tactics” used against protesters and journalists and called for Navalny’s “immediate and unconditional” release.

“We call on Russian authorities to release all those detained for exercising their universal rights,” U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.

The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a post on Twitter that he deplored the authorities “disproportionate use of force”, while Britain’s foreign minister, Dominic Raab, condemned the “use of violence against peaceful protesters and journalists”.

Navalny, a 44-year-old lawyer, is in a Moscow prison pending the outcome of four legal matters he describes as trumped up. He accuses President Vladimir Putin of ordering his attempted murder. Putin has dismissed that, alleging Navalny is part of a U.S.-backed dirty tricks campaign to discredit him.

Some protesters marched on the prison, where police were waiting to arrest them.

Images of protesters with injuries such as bloodied heads circulated on social media.

The scenes were reminiscent of the months-long unrest in Russia’s neighbouring ally Belarus where anti-government protests flared last August over allegations of voter fraud.

One Moscow protester, Sergei Radchenko, 53, said: “I’m tired of being afraid. I haven’t just turned up for myself and Navalny, but for my son because there is no future in this country.”

There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, which had previously called the protests illegal and the work of “provocateurs”.

State prosecutors opened criminal cases into alleged violence against police officers by protesters.

In Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, nearly 1,000 people demonstrated against Navalny’s arrest. Small demonstrations were also held in Bulgaria and some 200-300 people protested in Paris.

Police in Siberia’s Yakutsk, one of the coldest cities in the world, where the temperature was -52 Celsius (-62 F) on Saturday, grabbed a protester by his arms and legs and dragged him into a van, video footage showed.

In Moscow, some journalists covering the protests were detained, drawing a rebuke from the U.S. Embassy.

“Russian authorities arresting peaceful protesters, journalists,” spokesperson Rebecca Ross said on Twitter. “Appears to be a concerted campaign to suppress free speech, peaceful assembly.”

There were outages on mobile phone and internet services, the monitoring site downdetector.ru showed, a tactic sometimes used by authorities to make it harder for protesters to communicate among themselves.

In a push to galvanise support ahead of the protests, Navalny’s team released a video this week about an opulent palace on the Black Sea they alleged belonged to Putin, something the Kremlin denied. As of Saturday the video had been viewed more than 70 million times.

Navalny’s allies hope to tap into what polls say are pent-up frustrations among the public over years of falling wages and economic fallout from the pandemic.

But Putin’s grip on power looks unassailable for now and the 68-year-old president regularly records an approval rating of over 60%, much higher than that of Navalny.",Police crack down on Russian protests against jailing of Kremlin foe Navalny,www.metro.us
86,87,https://www.middleeaststar.com/news/267625583/tens-of-thousands-protest-in-russia-against-navalny-arrest,"Moscow [Russia], January 24 (ANI): Tens of thousands took to the streets in Russia on Saturday to protest against the arrest of opposition activist Alexey Navalny.

Rallies were organised in several cities of Russia. However, violence was also reported in several parts including in Moscow and St Petersburg as protestors clashed with police.

Russian police arrested more than 2,000 people and used force to break up rallies around the country, Al Jazeera reportedThe OVD-Info protest monitor group said at least 2,131 people - including 300 in the capital Moscow and 162 in Saint Petersburg - had been detained across Russia, a number likely to rise. It reported arrests at rallies in nearly 70 towns and cities.

Some 4,000 protestors were gathered in Moscow's Pushkinskaya Square, about a mile north of the Kremlin, on Saturday, police told Sputnik.

""Around 4,000 people have gathered in Pushkinskaya Square in Moscow for an unsanctioned event,"" the police said.

Scuffles broke out when riot police began to get targeted by projectile water bottles and eggs, leading to several detentions.

At least three officers were sprayed with white paint after protesters threw a can at the riot police, a Sputnik correspondent said.

A police source told Sputnik that 39 officers had been injured in Moscow protests, all of them lightly.

The protests broke out after Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was jailed this week upon returning from Germany where he was recovering after being poisoned by a nerve agent.

With the court's order on Monday, Navalny will have to remain in prison till February 15 and a different court has been set to decide whether to convert his suspended three and a half year sentence into real jail time, Al Jazeera reported.

He had arrived in Germany five months ago in a coma after being poisoned by Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent developed by Russia during the Soviet years. Several Western officials along with Navalny himself have openly blamed Russia for the poisoning, while the Kremlin has denied the allegations.

Navalny was placed on the country's federal wanted list during his time in Germany at the request of the Federal Penitentiary Service FSIN's, which had accused him in December 2020 of violating probation terms in a fraud case that was dismissed by Navalny as ""politically motivated"".Now the FSIN alleges that Navalny has been in violation of the terms of his suspended sentence by failing to show up for scheduled inspections.

Meanwhile, Germany, the UK, France, Italy and the European Union have called for Navalny's release. (ANI)",Tens of Thousands protest in Russia against Navalny arrest,www.middleeaststar.com
87,88,https://www.columbian.com/news/2021/jan/23/supporters-words-may-haunt-trump-at-impeachment-trial/,"WASHINGTON — The words of Donald Trump supporters who are accused of participating in the deadly U.S. Capitol riot may end up being used against him in his Senate impeachment trial as he faces the charge of inciting a violent insurrection. At least five supporters facing federal charges have suggested they were taking orders from the then-president when they marched on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6 to challenge the certification of Joe Biden’s election win. But now those comments, captured in interviews with reporters and federal agents, are likely to take center stage as Democrats lay out their case. It’s the first time a former president will face such charges after leaving office. “I feel like I was basically following my president. I was following what we were called to do. He asked us to fly there. He asked us to be there,” Jenna Ryan, a Texas real estate agent who posted a photo on Twitter of herself flashing a peace sign next to a broken Capitol window, told a Dallas-Fort Worth TV station. Jacob Chansley, the Arizona man photographed on the dais in the Senate who was shirtless and wore face paint and a furry hat with horns, has similarly pointed a finger at Trump. Chansley called the FBI the day after the insurrection and told agents he traveled “at the request of the president that all ‘patriots’ come to D.C. on January 6, 2021,” authorities wrote in court papers.

Chanley’s lawyer unsuccessfully lobbied for a pardon for his client before Trump’s term ended, saying Chansley “felt like he was answering the call of our president.” Authorities say that while up on the dais in the Senate chamber, Chansley wrote a threatening note to then-Vice President Mike Pence that said: “It’s only a matter of time, justice is coming.” Trump is the first president to be twice impeached and the first to face a trial after leaving office. The charge this time is “inciting violence against the government of the United States.” His impeachment lawyer, Butch Bowers, did not respond to call for comment. Opening arguments in the trial will begin the week of Feb. 8. House Democrats who voted to impeach Trump last week for inciting the storming of the Capitol say a full reckoning is necessary before the country — and the Congress — can move on. For weeks, Trump rallied his supporters against the election outcome and urged them to come to the Capitol on Jan. 6 to rage against Biden’s win. Trump spoke to the crowd near the White House shortly before they marched along Pennsylvania Avenue to Capitol Hill. “We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn’t happen,” Trump said. “You don’t concede when there’s theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore.”

Later he said: “If you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore.” He told supporters to walk to the Capitol to “peacefully and patriotically” make your voices heard. Trump has taken no responsibility for his part in fomenting the violence, saying days after the attack: “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate.” Unlike a criminal trial, where there are strict rules about what is and isn’t evidence, the Senate can consider anything it wishes. And if they can show that Trump’s words made a real impact, all the better, and scholars expect it in the trial. “Bringing in those people’s statements is part of proving that it would be at a minimum reasonable for a rational person to expect that if you said and did the things that Trump said and did, then they would be understood in precisely the way these people understood them,” said Frank Bowman, a Constitutional law expert and law professor at University of Missouri. A retired firefighter from Pennsylvania told a friend that that he traveled to Washington with a group of people and the group listened to Trump’s speech and then “followed the President’s instructions” and went to the Capitol, an agent wrote in court papers. That man, Robert Sanford, is accused of throwing a fire extinguisher that hit three Capitol Police officers.

Another man, Robert Bauer of Kentucky, told FBI agents that “he marched to the U.S. Capitol because President Trump said to do so,” authorities wrote. His cousin, Edward Hemenway, from Virginia, told the FBI that he and Bauer headed toward the Capitol after Trump said “something about taking Pennsylvania Avenue.” More than 130 people as of Friday were facing federal charges; prosecutors have promised that more cases — and more serious charges — are coming. Most of those arrested so far are accused of crimes like unlawful entry and disorderly conduct, but prosecutors this week filed conspiracy charges against three self-described members of a paramilitary group who authorities say plotted the attack. A special group of prosecutors is examining whether to bring sedition charges, which carry up to 20 years in prison, against any of the rioters. Two-thirds of the Senate is needed to convict. And while many Republicans — including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky– have condemned Trump’s words, it remains unclear how many would vote to convict him. “While the statements of those people kind of bolsters the House manager’s case, I think that President Trump has benefited from a Republican Party that has not been willing to look at evidence,” said Michael Gerhardt, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who testified before the House Judiciary Committee during Trump’s first impeachment hearings in 2019.",Supporters’ words may haunt Trump at impeachment trial,www.columbian.com

SEE THE LIST BELOW

Nor does the list include any representatives of the signature companies that Governor Gina Raimondo attracted to the state -- Johnson & Johnson, General Electric or others.

Perhaps the most surprising is that the list does not include any senior members of Raimondo’s staff or cabinet. GoLocal has learned that of Raimondo's personal staff of 40, fewer than ten have voiced an interest in staying with McKee.

“I will bring a grassroots, community-oriented philosophy to the Governor’s office because I believe state policies and programs should have the active input of our community leaders and citizens,” said McKee. “I believe Rhode Islanders deserve a leader who will listen to and engage them, and I will reach out to all 39 of our cities and towns to ensure they are heard. Our citizens want results that flow from their values and priorities – my transition has been built around this idea.”

McKee is faced with significant challenges -- near record unemployment, a $500 million deficit and the greatest public health emergency of the past century.

""Every single one of our 39 cities and towns will be represented, and its membership will reflect Rhode Island’s diversity. I believe that every voice counts and that everyone can make a contribution to defeat COVID-19, reopen our economy, and get our children back in the classroom safely. I will value every single transition member’s unique perspective and I look forward to working with them,"" said McKee.

""Everyone involved in this transition knows the stakes are high, and we won’t let Rhode Islanders down. The COVID-19 pandemic has closed schools, devastated small business, caused record unemployment, and created a significant budget shortfall. This team and my administration are ready to tackle those challenges from our first day in office. We all look forward to getting to work,” he added.

The Incoming Governor will announce additional transition advisors in the coming weeks. This week, he will meet virtually with a grassroots group of over 150 Rhode Islanders representing all 39 cities and towns to identify issues that are important to them and discuss ways to engage them in the transition.

The positions are not being added, but the funding for them is being transferred from the Department of State to the Department of Environmental Conservation. In Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s proposed 2022 Executive Budget, the state Department of Environmental Conservation would get $1.8 billion in new appropriations — an 11% increase — with most Adirondack programs’ funding staying level. The funding does not include new forest rangers or other staff but allots $800,000 for High Peaks overuse abatement, plus hundreds of millions for statewide clean water and green programs. “Given that this is a very tough budget year, given that there’s a lot of unknowns about what support may or may not come from Washington, the governor has put forth a budget that is consistent with the past few years for Adirondack priorities,” Protect the Adirondacks Executive Director Peter Bauer said. “Given the challenging times that we’re in, we think that the funding the governor has proposed makes sense.” The environmental advocate said he was bracing for potential cuts to DEC programs but was pleasantly surprised to not see them, at least not in the Executive Budget.

These cuts could still be made later in the year by the Division of Budget, which has been given powers to do so if the federal dollars Cuomo has requested do not come in. “We’re cautiously optimistic about this budget,” Bauer said. Most of the DEC funding is for the state’s larger green projects. Around $500 million is set aside for the Clean Water Infrastructure Act, and $300 million for the Environmental Protection Fund. These have remained the same since last year, though Bauer said a plan to scale up the EPF funding to $500 million a year has been postponed. DEC staffing would stay around the same with this proposed budget. Forest rangers have for years now said they do not have the staffing levels to adequately care for the people and the environment in the backcountry, especially in the increasingly busy High Peaks Wilderness. This budget would add seven new full-time employees to implement the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. “The Adirondacks and Catskills are at a disadvantage in the Legislature because so many of our legislators are Republicans who are in the minority and are largely spectators,” Bauer said.

He said increased DEC staffing is likely to need to come through an Executive Budget, as adding a few new forest rangers is not a high priority for most of the representatives in the Legislature. He said lobbying the governor as he forms his budget is the best way to get it done. He also said he finds it difficult when forest rangers tell the state they are in need of more staff and DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos says DEC staffing is adequate. Forest Ranger and union delegate of the Police Benevolent Association of New York State, Scott Van Laer, who is a vocal advocate for increased staffing, was not able to be contacted by publication time. State Sen. Dan Stec, the leading Republican on the Senate’s Environmental Conservation Committee, was also not able to be contacted by publication time, according to the Enterprise. According to data compiled by The Nature Conservancy, this year’s Environmental Protection Fund would include $30 million for state land purchases — down $1 million from last year. Bauer hopes that could be used toward the state purchasing Whitney Park — a 36,000-acre estate in Long Lake that green groups have asked the state to buy after its owner announced he wants to sell it for $180 million in 2020. Bauer also said it could be used to purchase the Three Rivers Forest, which the Conservation Fund bought two yeas ago. These lands would be added to the state Forest Preserve.",Breaking down the DEC's budget,poststar.com

92,93,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nancy-grace-on-larry-kings-passing-theres-never-been-anybody-like-him,"Fox Nation host Nancy Grace mourned the passing of her mentor and friend Larry King in an interview with Fox News on Saturday.

""There’s never been anybody like him,"" she said, ""and there will never be anybody like him from now on.""

King, a longtime CNN host and icon in the news industry, died Saturday at age 87 in Los Angeles.

The broadcasting legend became a household name because of his interviewing style, and ability to have seemingly meaningful conversations with celebrities, world leaders and everyday people.

LARRY KING, TV TALK-SHOW ICON WHO QUIZZED THE FAMOUS AND INFAMOUS, DIES AT 87

""He had such a rapport with people,"" Grace recalled. ""I don’t know if anyone could measure up to his style of interview. He set the bar for many, many other people.""

""He wanted to go out with a clean slate in his mind and ask the interviewee questions off the top of his head, questions like anyone who met that person on the street would want to know,"" she continued.

Grace attributes her career in part to her relationship with King, who she first met in 1997 after she was asked to come onto his show, following the launch of the legal commentary show ""Cochran & Grace.""

Grace continued to appear on ""Larry King Live"" for years before landing her own decade-long show in 2005, ""Nancy Grace"" on HLN, which is owned by CNN.

""Without Larry’s help, my career may not have been possible,"" Grace told Fox News on Saturday. ""For a girl that grew up on a red dirt road in the middle of Georgia, even meeting Larry King, much less having his support to launch my own program, was just unthinkable.""

""I tried to tell him over the years how much I appreciated him, but I don’t know that I ever had the words to tell him how much he meant to me,"" she said.

Grace remembered King as a ""genuine"" person, whose character came through -- both on and off camera.

""He was so gracious to people he knew, people he didn’t know, the waiter, the waitress – he was that way to everybody. The same way he was on the air when he would interview people, was the way he would speak to people in real life,"" she said.

LARRY KING OUT OF ICU AFTER BEING HOSPITALIZED WITH COVID-19

""In a world where it’s all about the sound bite, Larry wasn’t like that. He wanted to hear the whole story, and I learned that from him,"" she continued.

King was a journalistic icon in not only the vast number of interviews he conducted, including every sitting U.S. president from Gerald Ford to Barack Obama, but his casual manner that enabled the interviewee to open up.

King’s Q&A style transformed the perception of journalistic interviews, by allowing the interviewee to be the subject of importance, rather than the host – a style that Grace says has been lost in today’s media.

""In our TV culture now, it’s who speaks the loudest. It was not like that on the Larry King show at all, everybody got their say,"" she added, noting that he would sit three feet from the interviewee and look right into their eyes the entire interview.

""He was really listening,"" Grace said.

""I have a horrible, horrible habit of getting excited during an interview or a Q&A and jumping in,"" Grace told Fox News laughing. ""Larry hated that. And he was right.""

""Because he wanted to hear every last word a person had to say and he did not want me cutting anybody off, so I had to try and stop myself,"" she added remembering fondly.

94,95,https://www.hillsdale.net/news/20210123/seniors-struggle-with-vaccine-schedules,"HILLSDALE - As websites and complex online tools are used to schedule COVID-19 vaccine appointments across the United States, many seniors, who are prioritized for early vaccinations, are uncomfortable and unfamiliar with the technology used.

The systems are hard to navigate for many people, but they’re particularly inaccessible for older adults. Many people over the ages of 65 don't own a computer or have the ability to access the internet.

Lois Struther, 82, of Hillsdale, believes she's not the only one who is struggling.

""People can't get the shots and they should be,"" the former nurse said.

Not only that, she has been trying to schedule an appointment and can't get one.

""The Health Department kept telling me the 25th,"" Struther said. ""They also told me at 9 a.m. they would have appointments filled. So, I called the Senior Center to find out if they were doing shots. They said no, but they did give me a different phone number. I left my name, age and phone number, but they haven't called.""

Struther was reluctant to give that number, but according to the Hillsdale County Senior Center executive director Terry Vear, the information in on the center's Facebook Page and if people call the center, the number is given.

""I don't do anything on the internet and that's a problem,"" Struther said. ""People assume all old people do. I am a retired nurse and that's why I know (the vaccine's importance). I worked at the McGuire Unit for five years and then I moved to Florida.""

Struther currently lives at Evergreen Estates in Jonesville and said she knows of ""one lady who went to Detroit to get a shot. I don't know of others,"" she said. ""I have seen stories on CNN of others having the same trouble in other areas of the country - apparently it's nationwide. There was a couple in Florida, but I can't speak of their difficulties because things are different there.""

Struther said she has a daughter in the Jonesville area, another grown child lives in Detroit and another in Florida.

But information is sporadic and often confusing for all ages, she said.

Vear said the senior center is aware of the problem and they are doing what they can.

“Yes, we’ve helped people navigate and those without internet,"" Vear said. ""There’s a number to call and set up an appointment - they’ve been filling up quickly. The next vaccine clinic by the health department is scheduled in Jonesville Jan. 30. More information is on our website Facebook page.""

The information listed says if you are one of many that are trying to receive your Covid vaccine, the following information is needed: name, date of birth, address, phone number and email address. The notice asks for continued patience.

""If you have access to the internet or have a trusted family or friend that can help you to schedule your vaccine you can go to: www.bhsj.org,"" the post notes. ""For the time being, schedules and locations are being posted on Mondays at 9 a.m. If you do not have access to the internet, or need help to schedule, there is a dedicated number at Area Agency on Aging that you can call. Please leave a detailed message with your name, date of birth, address and phone number. When they schedule your vaccines they will call you. That phone number is 517-592-1705.""

Finding help across the country is an issue.

""The most vulnerable people are left behind even more so than if we hadn’t used more of a technology-oriented solution,” said Ethan Basch, a medical oncologist at the University of North Carolina.

Across the country, registration websites for vaccine appointments have been slammed with demand as soon as they launch, filling up within minutes. Many Florida county health departments turned to the event management platform Eventbrite to schedule appointments. New York City has multiple registration websites, some of which have dozens of fields to fill out and ask people to upload attachments. Navigating those platforms quickly enough to secure an appointment slot may be challenging for anyone not comfortable with computers or the internet and impossible for someone who doesn’t have access to those tools.

Only around half of people over the age of 75 use the internet at all, says Susan Nash, a visiting scholar at the Stanford Center on Longevity studying digital literacy options for older adults.

“The great irony of this problem is that the people we need to reach with the vaccine and get information to are the ones who are least likely to be online,” she said on a news website operated by Vox Media. “As we’ve experienced the pandemic, some of the easiest fixes have been to go online — and that leaves this whole population behind.""

Struther said many who would benefit most from the vaccine are being left to figure out how to get one on their own. She said she'll keep trying because she knows ""it's important.""

95,96,https://www.kristv.com/news/texas-news/democratic-colleagues-file-ethics-complaint-against-u-s-sen-ted-cruz-after-capitol-riot,"Seven Democrats in the U.S. Senate have filed an ethics complaint against U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for his role lending “legitimacy” to false claims of election fraud ahead of the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection in the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump.

In a letter addressed to the Senate Committee on Ethics, the Democratic senators argue that Cruz and U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, “made future violence more likely.” The Democrats called for the committee to conduct an investigation into the two Republican senators and consider “disciplinary action,” which could include the rare move of expulsion from the Senate. The Constitution also grants Congress the ability to censure its members, which is essentially just a strong condemnation from the chamber.

Leading up to the destructive Capitol riot, Cruz, Hawley and other congressional Republicans vowed to object to the 2020 election results based on Trump’s unfounded claims that the election was stolen from him. There is no evidence of widespread fraud on a level that would have affected the result. Even after a mob of Trump supporters desecrated the U.S. Capitol, Cruz objected to certifying Arizona’s electoral results, and he’s been in political hot water ever since.

Cruz told Politico that his objection “was the exact opposite of inciting violence.”

“What I was doing is debating principle and law and the Constitution on the floor of the United States Senate. That is how we resolve issues in this country without resorting to violence,” he said.

In a statement to The Texas Tribune, a Cruz spokesperson accused the seven Democrats of “playing political games,” calling the ethics complaint “frivolous.”

The Senate’s ethics manual lays out various rules for U.S. senators on campaign activity, conflicts of interest, gifts and what’s considered “improper conduct.” Once an ethics complaint is filed, the manual states that a preliminary inquiry is to be carried out “to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.” The process includes allowing the accused to officially respond to the complaints.

At any point in the investigation, the Senate ethics committee can hold a public or executive hearing to examine documents and hear testimonies.

Expelling a sitting Senator requires a two-thirds vote in the chamber; censuring requires only a majority vote. But not many federal lawmakers have faced such discipline. According to senate.gov, only 15 senators have been expelled since the 18th century — all for their allegiance to the Confederacy — and only nine were censured between 1811 and 1990, for a variety of “transgressions” like fighting in the chamber.

Cruz denounced the violence, but he has faced fierce backlash from Democrats, and even some Republicans.

“You have some senators who, for political advantage, were giving false hope to their supporters, misleading them to believe somehow yesterday’s actions in Congress could reverse the results of the election,” U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, said during a Fox News interview. “That was never going to happen, yet these senators, as insurrectionists literally stormed the Capitol, were sending out fundraising emails.”

96,97,https://keyt.com/politics/2021/01/22/ted-cruz-and-josh-hawley-have-been-playing-with-dynamite/,"Remember that time a violent mob smashed its way into the Capitol, killed a police officer and occupied the Senate chambers, hunting for terrified members of Congress who were forced to hide?

Remember how some in the mob constructed a gallows with a hangman’s noose outside the Capitol, then rampaged through the halls searching for the vice president and the speaker of the house — the officials second and third in line of succession to the President — chanting “Hang Pence!” and “Where’s Nancy?”

And remember how the specific goal of the violent attack — overturning the election of President Joe Biden — was being advanced by sycophantic lawmakers who shamefully tried to invalidate the votes of an estimated 10 million Americans in Arizona and Pennsylvania and declare Donald Trump the winner?

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri apparently hope you don’t remember any of that. Or that you’ll treat it like one more bit of the normal back-and-forth of politics.

Cruz and Hawley, like others who endorsed and/or sought political benefit from the lies that brought chaos at the Capitol, are up against an enraged public. A public that will never forget one of the most vicious and serious attacks ever launched against American democracy.

Law enforcement officials are diligently tracking down and arresting lots of people — nearly 100 as of this writing — suspected of participating in the mob attack. The probe is expanding to include members of far-right organizations like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.

But what about the people who were attacking democracy from inside the Capitol building? What about the lawmakers who dishonestly pretended that, despite multiple recounts and dozens of legal rulings, the 2020 election was somehow so tainted that the outcome should be overturned?

What, in short, about Cruz and Hawley?

Seven senators filed an ethics complaint against Cruz and Hawley, calling their support for the wholesale overturning of election results “improper conduct reflecting on the Senate” that should result in an investigation and “recommendations for strong disciplinary action, including up to expulsion or censure, if warranted by the facts uncovered.”

That sentiment was echoed by members of the public, who made the phrase “As a Texan” trend on Twitter on the day the ethics complaint was filed, with one person tweeting, for example, “As a Texan, as an American, I’m outraged in the treasonous actions from @SenTedCruz to incite an armed insurrection at the Capitol. @tedcruz resigning is an easy out, he must be expelled.”

Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington (CREW), a watchdog group, tweeted: “There is no room in Congress for people who incited the January 6th insurrection like Ted Cruz or Josh Hawley. They must go.”

Predictably, the opportunists Hawley and Cruz have struck a defiant tone, with Hawley vowing to “never apologize” for trying to overturn election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania, and Cruz telling a Texas radio station: “What I was doing and what the other senators were doing is what we were elected to do, which is debating matters of great import in the chamber of the United States Senate.”

What the senators may not understand is that there’s a very big difference between debating matters of legitimate dispute — like where to set tax rates or how to fund bridges, roads and schools — and giving credence and political support to dangerous, fact-free conspiracy theories.

It’s unlikely that the Senate will expel Cruz and Hawley from their ranks: Such strong measures haven’t been taken since the 1860s, when a raft of traitorous lawmakers — including two each from Texas and Missouri — were kicked out for supporting the Confederacy against the United States.

But Cruz and Hawley now stand exposed as the kind of cynical politicians whose misleading statements, phony outrage and outright lies contributed to the attack on the Capitol, and on the recently concluded election.

This season’s crop of blunt, commanding and steely female protagonists — seen in 'Ammonite,' 'The Forty-Year-Old Version,' 'Nomadland,' 'Pieces of a Woman' and 'Promising Young Woman' — provide strength in numbers.

Frances McDormand’s van-dwelling character utters these unequivocal words during a crucial exchange in Nomadland, one that unfolds in the guest room of a suburban house. A strikingly similar rejection of a well-meaning offer — of shelter, of security — takes place near the end of Ammonite when Kate Winslet’s 19th century paleontologist surveys a well-appointed chamber meant to inspire her with its creature comforts. “You presumed I’d just be fitted into your life here,” she tells the woman she loves. “You don’t understand me.”

Delivering two of the most indelible lead performances of 2020, McDormand and Winslet portray ferociously independent women. On that front, they’re hardly alone in what has been a strong year for female actresses. In very different ways, Carey Mulligan (Promising Young Woman), Viola Davis (Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom), Vanessa Kirby (Pieces of a Woman) and Radha Blank (The Forty-Year-Old Version) also play women who refuse to be placed in a nice, neat room. None of these characters is vying for a Miss Congeniality trophy, and they don’t care if you like them.

Ribbon-tied boxes of “likability” have long been the domain of too many women onscreen. Is there anything more sexist than the notion that no one will be interested in a female character if she isn’t likable — or its dreaded corollary, relatable? It’s the storytelling equivalent of being accosted on the street and urged to “smile!” When it comes to the cheery fictional places women have been expected to occupy, with all their faux comforts, does a robust assortment of awards contenders, fueled by take-me-as-I-am firepower, signal that time’s up?

It’s not that complex female characters are something new in high-profile fare, as a glance at recent winners of the lead actress Oscar makes clear. But the latest offerings signal a shift away from certain conventions. In past portraits of “difficult” women, there’s often a redemptive angle at work, a reason to forgive them for the supposed sin of being brusque, contrary or demanding — or to punish them for it. Renée Zellweger’s Judy Garland in last year’s Judy is an emotional wreck, but whatever damage she inflicts is counterbalanced by her musical genius. In 2013’s Blue Jasmine, Cate Blanchett plays a modern-day Blanche DuBois, the epitome of feminine vulnerability, whose self-absorption and emotional fragility are her undoing. And for McDormand’s vengeance-bent Mildred in 2017’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, her relentless cruelty and violence are propelled by maternal grief.

This year’s group of flinty protagonists have their backstories and their reasons, but the details of their experiences aren’t packaged as mitigating circumstances. Without apology or pleading, the films embrace their characters’ complexity and rough edges. Their redemption or forgiveness is not the goal any more than their comeuppance is.

Vengeance is at the heart of Promising Young Woman. A guileful manipulator like none we’ve ever seen, Mulligan’s Cassie is an avenging angel conceived by a writer-director with an established interest in what she calls malevolent women: former Killing Eve showrunner Emerald Fennell, making her feature debut. With its elaborate layers of performance, Mulligan’s breathtaking turn is a bitter fusion of sugar-coating and payback. Turning the tables on everyday nice-guy predators, Cassie calculates and weighs her every move, a feline entrapping her prey but trapped too in the enormity of her mission: redressing a crime and making the world — or at least her neighborhood — a safer place for women. She’s hyperreal yet fully in the groove of someone who knows the brutal score.

If anyone knows the score, it’s Davis’ Ma Rainey, the commanding center of director George C. Wolfe’s screen version of August Wilson’s play. As the real-life blues great, Davis embodies the inescapable politics of race and class and gender in the story’s 1927 setting. But Ma knows her worth and the power of “no.” She struts and stomps and lays down the law, a vision of defiance with her unfeminine ways and mouth full of gold. “They wanna take your voice and trap it in all them fancy boxes with all them buttons and dials,” she says — an echo of the pretty rooms in Ammonite and Nomadland.

A world away from the Chicago recording studio of Ma Rainey, Francis Lee’s Ammonite is no less concerned with matters of talent, recognition and respect. Set on the wind-whipped southern coast of England in the 1840s, the story of Mary Anning finds her selling beach souvenirs to tourists while pursuing her life’s work as an accomplished but unsung scientist. She’s caught between the near-at-hand business of tchotchkes and the unattainable boys’-club academy. Customer-service niceties are as foreign to her as they are to Mulligan’s hostile barista, and her bluntness has an exquisite power. (As strong as Lee’s film is, the need to explore a fascinating real-life figure through a fabricated love story, with another real-life character played by Saoirse Ronan, remains debatable — and is perhaps a concession, on some level, to conventional measures of relatability, a way of softening the dramatic sting.)

When Winslet’s Mary says, “I had my work. I didn’t need a child as well,” she means it. Usually when a woman says this in a movie, we’re to understand that she’s mistaken, deluded, suffering from a lack that needs to be remedied. But there are many ways to define what it means to create and nurture, and the movies discussed here take their protagonists outside stereotypical confines. With one exception, none of the central characters has children, that outlier being Kirby’s Martha in Pieces of a Woman, a drama that spins around the wrenching death of a newborn. The movie itself is not always as courageous as Martha, but at its strongest it’s a study in the contrast between busyness and stillness. Those around Martha occupy themselves with legalities and blame for the baby’s death; she mourns. She does so on her own terms, not by ingratiating herself to the audience with the therapy-speak and tears we’ve come to expect in stories of loss, but with a steely reserve that alienates everyone she knows.

Fern, Nomadland’s resilient protagonist, is also in mourning. On top of being widowed, she loses her livelihood to the vagaries of the economy after a plant closure essentially wipes her Nevada company town off the map. Placing her lead actor among real-life American nomads, filmmaker Chloé Zhao paints a portrait that resists easy labels and tidy solutions. Fern is quick to point out that she’s houseless, not homeless. Something deep in her soul responds to the subculture she’s found, cut loose from ordinary conceptions of a good life.

One of the year’s most striking debuts belongs to a writer-director-actor working in the realm of comedy, where unconventional female characters have always been an easier fit (though not exempt from the traditional requirement of “redeeming qualities”). Radha Blank’s character in the The Forty-Year-Old Version is exceedingly easy to like, but not because she strives to be accommodating. As a struggling playwright who finds her voice as a rapper, Blank is enacting a spin on her own story. Like Mary Anning and Ma Rainey, Radha knows she has talent, but it takes her a while, and some hilariously awful concessions to the power players of Broadway, to stand strong. The movie’s turning point is a Bronx rap battle in which four women vie to be Queen of the Ring, throwing down blistering rhymes. This is a room where the insults fly and the voices are strong. Check your likability at the door.

As they reject well-worn paths and decline the supposed “solution” of romantic or maternal love, the women in these dramas don’t explain themselves to make sure we approve. This suggests that filmmakers, actors and audiences alike might be done with female characters who conform to an outdated checklist for likability. Maybe it’s enough that they’re compelling.

99,100,https://www.veteranstoday.com/2021/01/23/trump-plotted-to-overturn-georgia-election-result-report/,"Media reports have unveiled a plot by former US President Donald Trump to oust former acting attorney general Jefferey Rosen in an effort to turn the undo Georgia’s election result.

The New York Times reported on Friday that Justice Department attorney Jeffrey Clark had convinced Trump in early January to remove then-acting AG, who was head of the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) and the chief lawyer of the federal government, and use the DoJ to turn Georgia’s election results which could have changed the presidential election in Trump’s favor.

Trump, who publicly claimed after the US presidential election in November 2020, that election fraud had tainted the election results, agreed to replace Rosen with Clark who would follow-up on the former President’s claims of election-rigging by the Democrats, and use the legal authority vested in the DoJ to undo the vote in Georgia which had been counted in favor of Trump’s rival.

Clark, who had met Trump earlier this month through a Pennsylvanian politician, had vowed use the DoJ to stop Congress from certifying the election results in then-President-elect Joe Biden’s favor, according to the paper.

The New York Times report said that after being informed of the plot to fire him to change the Georgia vote-count, Rosen arranged a meeting with Trump and Clark, with another top DoJ official in attendance, in addition to White House counsel Pat Cipollone and other lawyers.

At the meeting, after nearly three hours of arguments between Rosen and Clark, Trump retreated from the move, allowing Rosen to remain in his post.

However, the paper cited four former Trump administration officials as noting that what had changed Trump’s mind was a joint threat by other members of the DoJ leadership to resign if Rosen were fired, added to fears of congressional investigations, in addition to looming blowback from fellow Republicans.

In this regard, the Times talked to Clark. The DoJ attorney, who had been promoted to the acting head of the civil division in September, claimed the report about the plot to oust Rosen and put him in his place by Trump contained inaccurate material in it.

He, however, declined to tell the Times what the accurate material would be, claiming he was not at liberty to talk about the meetings with Trump and other White House officials which he claimed were all legal and lawful.

“Senior Justice Department lawyers, not uncommonly, provide legal advice to the White House as part of our duties,” he told the paper.

Earlier reports said that immediately after Trump replaced former US Attorney General William Barr with Rosen, he had exerted pressure on him to appoint special counsels to probe the election fraud he was after.

However, Rosen, like his predecessor, had refused to give in to the demand, telling Trump that launching such probes required evidence of election fraud which dd not exist, the paper reported. Trump continued to press Rosen, blaming the DoJ for the failure to find evidence on election fraud.

Trump’s defiance of the presidential election result and complaints about the US election system, which continues till this day, has tainted the image of US democracy echoed by its politicians in propaganda dictated by Washington.

Trump loyalists stormed the Capitol Hill on January 6 after Trump announced that he will never concede, to show support for the former president’s “Stop the Steal” campaign.

Garret Miller, who is from the Dallas suburb of Richardson, was arrested on Friday after being named in a five-count federal complaint.

Authorities allege that Miller posted photos and videos on his social media accounts that show him inside the Capitol during the January 6 storming of the building by supporters of then-president Donald Trump.

It is also alleged that he called for violence in online posts, including a tweet that simply read: “Assassinate AOC,” a reference to Ms Ocasio-Cortez.

In another tweet, Miller posted: “They are right next time we bring the guns,” an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit.

Miller also threatened a US Capitol police officer during an exchange on Instagram, writing that he planned to “hug his neck with a nice rope”, the affidavit states.

After posting a photo on Facebook showing him inside the Capitol, Miller responded to a comment on the picture with: “just want to incriminate myself a little lol,” according to an FBI affidavit.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez posted Miller’s charging documents on Twitter on Friday and then tweeted: “On one hand you have to laugh, and on the other know that the reason they were this brazen is because they thought they were going to succeed.”

Miller’s lawyer, Clint Broden, said his client regrets the actions he took “in a misguided effort to show his support for former President Trump.

“His social media comments reflect very ill-considered political hyperbole in very divided times and will certainly not be repeated in the future,” Mr Broden said.

“He looks forward to putting all of this behind him.

“We are hopeful that, given his family support and regret for his actions, he will be released so that he can resolve the charges against him in a timely fashion.”

Five cases of the coronavirus variant, B.1.1.7., have been identified and additional tracing continues for other possible positive cases , county health officials said.

""Brief, public exposures are not normally a COVID-19 exposure concern but the B.1.1.7. variant is more easily transmitted and could lead to more cases, hospitalizations and deaths,"" the department said in a release Saturday.

As a precaution, residents should immediately get tested if they visited Meijer on Saline Road on Jan. 17 between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. or Briarwood Mall, located at 100 Briarwood Circle, from 1-2 p.m., where the new variant was circulating.

“The possibility of additional spread of the variant is a concern,” said Dr. Juan Luis Marquez, medical director with Washtenaw County Health Department, in the statement. “At this point and with the guidance of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, we are encouraging extra precautions.

""Seek testing if you have symptoms, have recently been exposed to COVID-19, or have recently traveled to a place where the new variant is circulating. And everyone should make sure they are using all COVID-19 precautions consistently. This includes face masks, social distancing, hand cleaning, avoiding crowds or gatherings, and following isolation and quarantine guidance.”

MDHHS, in a separate release, also detected a case of the B.1.1.7 variant in a Wayne County resident.

The first reported case of the variant in Michigan was identified on Jan. 16 in a woman part of the University of Michigan community. She recently traveled to the United Kingdom, where the variant originated, according to the statement by the department. The person's close contacts have been informed and are in quarantine.

However, it’s not clear if all cases are connected to that first case, the department said.

B.1.1.7. is believed to be more contagious, but there has been no indication that it affects the clinical outcomes or disease severity compared to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has been circulating across the United States for months, the health department said in a press release.

Washtenaw County Health Department, MDHHS and UM are working closely to implement additional containment strategies to slow the spread of the variant.

“We have been warning people for weeks that this variant would likely be identified in the State of Michigan,” said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state's chief medical executive, in the release. “Now is the time for people to take additional precautions and limit any potential exposures. Wear your mask, wash your hands, avoid gatherings and make an appointment for a vaccine when it’s your turn. We all have a role to play in ending this pandemic.”

Residents can receive free testing Sunday from 12-5 p.m. at Pioneer High School, located at 601 W. Stadium Blvd. in Ann Arbor. Pre-registration is available but not required.

It’s been widely — indeed, endlessly — noted that Peloton has been a rare “winner” of the pandemic. With gyms reeling, many have opted for the high-tech home bike system, which involves a $1,900 piece of hardware and a $39 monthly subscription for custom exercise classes. The latest dramatic twist: Now the eight-year-old publicly traded company is reportedly “threatened” by its own struggles to meet the demand and fulfill orders for impatient customers. “The hype surrounding Peloton is like no other,” one analyst told the New York Times earlier this week.

This insulated slice of America — the million or so Peloton owners and their professional-class peers Zooming and home-ordering from Whole Foods through the pandemic recession — is the Peloton Economy. It’s gotten quite a bit of attention in a year when health and economic forces have simultaneously upturned and ended lives month after month. But ultimately, we need to face up to the fact that the Peloton Economy is not a bellwether — it’s a warning signal underscoring a serious problem that should be a top priority not just for the new Biden-Harris administration, but for business at large.

For the millions of Americans who experienced the coronavirus era as a calamity of lost jobs, lost health care, and stunted wages, the Peloton Economy is an alternate universe. As Marker’s Steve LeVine noted recently in a skeptical take on the theory that we’re entering a new Roaring Twenties, “The pandemic has deepened the modern U.S. wealth gap: The top 1% holds 15 times as much wealth as the bottom half combined.”

Covid-19 obviously did not cause income inequality, but as with so many issues, the virus has laid bare and exacerbated this deep national flaw. DealBook’s Andrew Ross Sorkin recently reported on a manifesto-like document being circulated by an advisory group to JPMorgan Chase, made up of business and policy leaders. Their message in part: “Unless and until the core problem of inequality is addressed, all other overarching objectives and desires will remain elusive.” In other words, business has “a commercial stake in advocating for a fairer, more equitable system” because that’s what expands the marketplace in the long run. The big-picture economy transcends the short-term interest of any single player.

The new presidential administration faces an array of urgent crises — public health, economic despair, racial injustice, climate change — but addressing income inequality is a theme that runs through all of them. That needs to be backed with concrete steps to directly help those who need it most, like the new round of proposed Covid-19 economic relief that reportedly includes boosting the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. (It’s been stuck at $7.25 for about a dozen years; that’s around $15,000 a year for a full-time job.) Or serious tax reform that rolls back Trump-era breaks for corporations and the wealthy. Or additional stimulus money put into mainstream hands to get pumped back into mainstream businesses like restaurant chains — proof of why it’s in companies’ best interests to exercise their newfound political courage to back efforts that address inequality head-on.

With a nation facing as many intersecting dilemmas as this one, the Peloton Economy — hyped through slack-jawed reports of that company’s 5X stock price rise over the past year — isn’t just a distraction. Ultimately, it’s a damaging sideshow. As of September, about 1.3 million people owned Peloton equipment. As of December, before Congress acted to extend unemployment benefits, an estimated 12 million people were on the verge of being pushed into “some form of destitution,” as the New York Times put it.

Robertson shared an excerpt from a letter citing “conduct unbecoming an officer” as the reason for his firing. The letter states he will be terminated Tuesday. The town is giving the officers the chance to resign before that date, “or in my case retire,” Robertson wrote Saturday. “I will not be resigning. I’ll fight this at every step.” He claimed the town violated procedure in order to “make it quick” and that his fellow former Officer Jacob Fracker “is a good kid who doesn’t deserve it.” Fracker did not respond to messages seeking comment. Saturday, Rocky Mount Town Manager James Ervin declined to comment on Robertson’s statements. “The officers’ state was changed to suspended without pay Friday,” he said. The town is continuing to review Robertson and Fracker’s situation. “We expect to have our review completed by Tuesday morning,” with a statement to follow, Ervin said.

On Jan. 13, federal authorities charged Robertson, 47, and Fracker, 29, with a misdemeanor of knowingly entering a restricted building without authority to do so to engage in conduct that disrupts government business; and a petty offense of engaging in disruptive conduct in the Capitol in order to interfere with a session of Congress. The penalty for the misdemeanor is up to a year in jail. The penalty for the petty offense is up to six months. In a selfie that Fracker took inside the Capitol Crypt, Fracker is making an obscene gesture. Robertson is pointing at Fracker while holding a wooden pole. The men have stated repeatedly in interviews that they did nothing illegal and did not participate in any of the violence that unfolded during the insurrection in the Capitol. Robertson maintained that stance Friday in an interview conducted via text messages about a newly unsealed federal warrant that alleges he and Fracker might have participated directly in the riots. First unveiled through a story published Friday evening by the Daily Beast, the warrant filed by a Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent alleges that Fracker bragged to a friend in a Facebook message that he urinated in U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s toilet while he was in the Capitol. “S—- was wild lol I p——- in Nancy P’s toilet,” Fracker wrote, according to the warrant.

Fracker shared videos of himself inside the building wearing a gas mask, according to the warrant, and wrote, “We did hahaha it was f——— amazing. Flash bangs going off, CS gas, rubber bullets flying by. Felt so good to be back in the s—- hahaha I was like 8th person inside the building,” comparing the experience to action he saw as a U.S. Marine serving in Afghanistan. Fracker, now a corporal in the Virginia Army National Guard, was the first active serviceman known to have been charged in connection to the riot, according to a Jan. 14 story in the Army Times. Robertson served in Iraq in the U.S. Army Reserve and later went to Afghanistan working for defense contractor DynCorp, then Xe, he has said. Both men are trained snipers. Robertson wrote Friday that even if Fracker made those claims, those events could not have happened. “He didn’t get close to Pelosi’s office unless he’s Superman because I lost sight of him for maybe two minutes? Then found him in the statue room.” Fracker wasn’t wearing a gas mask in the Capitol, Robertson wrote. “None of us had gas masks … we were wearing street clothes,” he wrote. In an on-camera interview aired Jan. 19 by Channel 4 in Great Britain, Fracker acknowledged violence took place in the Capitol, “but not while we were there.” The FBI warrant alleges that Robertson sent a photo of a bruise to a friend on Facebook along with the text, “Shot in the ass with a rubber bullet.”

Robertson wrote that the “rubber bullet” claim was a joke. “I was shot by my son two days later with a paintball,” he wrote, “and sent it to a few people.” Federal investigators searching his private social media communications are misinterpreting statements made in jest, he wrote. “Ministry of Truth type stuff. ‘1984’ was supposed to be fiction,” he wrote. “We have had our homes searched, First Amendment rights restricted and Second Amendment rights removed over a misdemeanor trespassing charge.” A video posted by nonprofit news organization Pro Publica shows a large crowd milling in the Capital Crypt at 2:30 p.m Jan. 6. After viewing the video multiple times, Robertson confirmed in a text message that he is the man wearing a blue backpack with black stripes who twice appears briefly, standing by a pillar with his back to the camera. The video “shows even better what I’ve been saying all along about where I was,” he wrote. “That was certainly the area and the general mood of where I was at. No rioting or fighting police obviously.” When the violence took place in the Capitol, “it was not around me.” Late Friday, Robertson provided The Roanoke Times with the written statement he gave to town officials Friday morning about what he and Fracker did at the Capitol on Jan. 6. The statement is consistent with accounts he has relayed to The Roanoke Times in interviews.

He and Fracker walked up the main Capitol steps “without barricades with 1000s of others,” he wrote. Capitol Police handed out water and directed people to stay within public areas, he wrote. “I did observe areas being blocked off by them and stayed away from those areas as instructed, as did all others I observed. I and Officer Fracker had gotten separated at this point by the large volume of people, so I made my way to the statue room, a public area, where I located him again,” Robertson wrote. The photo Fracker and Robertson took in the Capitol Crypt has circulated worldwide. Robertson has said they posed for the photo after a fellow Rocky Mount officer asked about their well-being. “An officer from the department had called us and said, ‘Hey, we heard things are getting pretty crazy up there, are y’all okay?’ and we sent that picture to say, ‘Yeah, we’re okay.’ It was meant to be a personal photo that went to another officer,” he said. The response Robertson received from town officials stated that “your response did not provide sufficient exculpatory information” and that Robertson has “engaged in actions that permanently impact your credibility as a witness.” In interviews, the town manager has said and written that town staff first learned about the photo Jan. 7.

“To the extent that some of our other officers may have been privy to the image before management, that’s a separate issue that we will have to address as we go forward,” Ervin said. On Jan. 8, the men were debriefed to determine whether their involvement “went beyond free speech and assembly,” Ervin said. “They claimed that their entry into the Capitol was authorized and that they were allowed into the building.” Town management learned about the photo Jan. 9 and “researched the open-closed status of the building, determining that the building was in fact closed,” Ervin said. “I myself turned the operation over to the FBI.” Fracker and Robertson were placed on paid administrative leave the morning of Jan. 10, with the notice of termination from the town coming 12 days later, Robertson wrote. “I don’t deserve the treatment that I am getting over a simple protest,” Robertson wrote. Earlier this week, the Franklin County Chapter of Black Lives Matter and activist group Franklin County Voters Matter released statements calling for the firing of Fracker and Robertson and the resignations of Town Manager Ervin and Police Chief Ken Criner. “While we support the firing of the officers, we continue to ask for the resignation of the Town Manager and the Police Chief,” Franklin County Voters Matter founder Eddie Seay wrote in an email Saturday.

“Two down, two to go,” said Bridgette Craighead, founder of the Black Lives Matter chapter. The town should have placed the officers on unpaid leave when they first became aware of the photo in the Capitol, she said. “The severity of the Capitol riot, that was a serious situation. People died.” Seay has expressed skepticism that town officials weren’t aware of militant social media posts the men made in the weeks after the U.S. presidential election. A few of Robertson’s comments are cited in the new FBI warrant, such as one from Dec. 19 supporting “open armed rebellion.” Craighead pointed out that Fracker’s and Robertson’s actions have brought the world media’s attention to Franklin County. She recently gave an interview to Dagens Nyheter, a daily newspaper in Stockholm, Sweden. “The world has heard my voice more than my county has,” Craighead said. “Since our leaders here don’t see a problem, maybe the world can tell them the problem.” Be the first to know Get local news delivered to your inbox!",Rocky Mount officer says he and colleague fired for participating in U.S. Capitol riot,martinsvillebulletin.com
110,111,https://www.neworleanssun.com/news/267624410/jonas-gwangwa-embodied-south-africas-struggle-for-a-national-culture,"Music is not a zero sum game with only one 'best'. But if you seek to name one musician whose life embodies the South African people's struggle for a national culture, it must be trombonist, composer and cultural activist Jonas Mosa Gwangwa, who was born on 19 October 1937 in Orlando East, Johannesburg, and died on 23 January 2021 in Johannesburg aged 83.

Through 65 years on stage, Gwangwa's playing contributed to every genre of South African jazz. Overseas, he was hailed as player, producer and composer. Yet he chose to step away from mainstream success for ten years, leading the Amandla Cultural Ensemble of the African National Congress (ANC) to win hearts for the anti-apartheid struggle everywhere and present a vision of what post-apartheid national culture could be.

He battled painful injury (accidents shattered the same femur three times), was hunted for his life by the regime's forces and experienced both the heyday of South African liberation culture and the far more ambivalent times since.

Throughout, he cherished a half-century-plus, love affair with his wife Violet, and brought his family - scattered across half the globe - home intact to a free South Africa. Violet's death, only a few short weeks before his, had left him and the rest of the family devastated.

Gwangwa started his career in the 1950s in the Father Huddleston Band at St Peter's College in Johannesburg. When instruments were allocated he hoped for a clarinet, but was shy to object to the offered trombone.

There was music in the family, lessons at school, and from American jazzmen on the bioscope screen at the Odin Cinema in Sophiatown. From Dizzy Gillespie, the schoolboy Gwangwa borrowed his lifetime trademark: a jaunty black beret. He became, in his own words ""this little bebopper"".

Politics shaped Gwangwa too. The 1954 Bantu Education Act ended Father Huddleston's St Peters, but not before the band had played at the adoption of the Freedom Charter in Kliptown. He said

Because trombone was a scarce sound in African jazz bands, Gwangwa's tricky bebop chops caught the ears of the elite Jazz Dazzlers. His vision expanded with the Jazz Epistles, whose Jazz Epistles: Verse One became the first modern jazz album from a black South African band.

That was the first of several firsts. Gwangwa was co-copyist for the first all-black South African stage musical, King Kong, travelling with the show to London and starting a lifelong love affair with the stage musical format:

London contacts helped Gwangwa secure a place at the Manhattan School of Music in New York. There, sharing a flat with Hugh Masekela, his meagre allowance went as often on gig tickets as food, as he imbibed mainstream classics and the new 'free jazz'.

Equally active in politics, he helped organise South African students in America, and served as first eye on the text drafted by old schoolfriend, poet Keorapetse Kgositsile, of Miriam Makeba's 1963 anti-apartheid address to the UN.

He worked with Makeba and Harry Belafonte, most famously as arranger, adapter and conductor for the 1965 Grammy-winning Best Folk Album An Evening with Harry Belafonte and Miriam Makeba: another first.

Then came residencies, film scores, multiple recordings across genres, musical direction, and tours; with the Union of South Africa, and with Herb Alpert, when the trombonist won seven curtain calls for a barnstorming solo on his own Foreign Natives. Despite its painful interruption midstream by the reckless driver who first crushed his leg, Gwangwa's American jazz star was rising.

But he had loyalties bigger than the stage.

In 1980, Gwangwa answered the call from ANC President OR Tambo to scour the military camps of Angola for young talent to establish the campaigning Amandla Cultural Ensemble. The call was too politically important to ignore, and the opportunity to create an entire stage show excited Gwangwa so much that ""sometimes ... I couldn't sleep"".

He spent most of the next decade between Amandla (rehearsing in Angola and touring the world) and Botswana (with his family and contributing to the local cultural scene with the Medu Arts Ensemble). In both settings he was an innovator. Botswana musicians say he helped build their professionalism and shifted their focus towards indigenous inspirations. In Amandla, he consciously re-visioned traditions, casting female performers in previously all-male traditional dance roles:

Some cynical analysts suggest Amandla's winning musical arrangements and dramatic stage interludes simply prettied-up struggle culture for overseas audiences; they miss the point. Gwangwa's love for the struggle was genuine and deep, never cosmetic - and he couldn't have written an unattractive tune if he tried.

Gwangwa believed that political theatre deserved exactly the same high aesthetic standards as any other stage performance, and according to the memories of other Amandla performers, he enforced these relentlessly at rehearsal. Audiences everywhere responded to that combination of passion and professionalism.

Amandla's impact put the Gwangwa family home on the SADF hit list for the 1985 raid on Botswana.

It was razed (fortunately the occupants were elsewhere) and the regime's hunt did not cease. Roots were pulled up again, for London, then America. During that uneasy, unsettled time, Gwangwa scored another first: an Oscar nomination (and more) for his Cry Freedom film score, co-composed with George Fenton.

Finally home again in 1991, some recognition arrived: Orders of Ikhamanga for both him and Amandla; commissions for various official and pan-African causes; honorary degrees and more.

Yet he still constantly struggled to earn from tours, shows and recordings, encountered record label problems over material deemed ""political"" - and 'state composer' was not who he wanted to be. Although he was committed to the new South Africa and happy to contribute, he really ""wanted to be on the ground with the guys,"" he told me in 2019 from his sickbed, ""doing something important"".

He was saddened by globalised, commoditised official perspectives on the arts, and by the sidelining of everything Amandla had tried to build. His music had always explicitly been his weapon, and

In June 2019, Gwangwa was struck by a serious illness that left him bedridden. He struggled valiantly towards recovery and was never bitter.

Interviewing him for his forthcoming biography, I asked him what he was proudest of. ""Amandla. Because it involved all the things in music that excited me the most, and gave me the opportunity to bring them together ... for the most important reason possible: it was for the people.""

The remarks were made by John Nkengasong, director of the Africa CDC, after the announcement that the African Export-Import Bank will facilitate payments by providing advance procurement commitment guarantees of up to 2 billion U.S. dollars to the manufacturers on behalf of the African Union (AU) members.



 “The biggest challenges to COVID-19 vaccine access in Africa have been financing of the vaccines and the logistics of vaccinating at scale, but we are glad that this gap is being filled by the African Export-Import Bank financing facility,” said John Nkengasong, Director of Africa CDC.



 “The critical decision now is how to get started so that once we start there will be no disruptions, and this is where the Africa Medical Supplies Platform (AMSP) will play a very big role,” the Africa CDC Director said.



 On Tuesday, the Africa CDC had announced the commencement of a COVID-19 vaccines pre-order program for all the AU members.



 The move by the AMSP, on behalf of the Africa CDC, came a week after the announcement by the South African President and African Union (AU) Chairperson, Cyril Ramaphosa, on January 14 that the AU has secured a provisional 270 million COVID-19 vaccine doses for Africa through its COVID-19 African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT).



 The AMSP, in order to support vaccination operations, has also launched a new category of vaccine accessories which will help member states to procure products such as ultra-low temperature freezers, personal protective equipment, cotton wool rolls, syringes and needles.



 While AVATT has secured a provisional 270 million COVID-19 vaccines doses from Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca, AMSP — the single-source platform enabling faster, more transparent and cost-effective access to COVID-19 supplies — has opened the pre-orders program.



 According to the Africa CDC, the initiative offers equitable access to COVID-19 vaccine doses for the AU members.



 President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the African Export-Import Bank, Benedict Oramah, also stressed that the Afrexim Bank is proud to expand its support to African economies in their bid to contain the pandemic.",Africa CDC Commends African Export-Import Bank for Financing COVID-19 Vaccine,www.peacefmonline.com
112,113,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/the-inner-eye-lessons-for-new-india-from-a-british-empress/cid/1804579,"His wife heavily gravid and going to deliver any moment, barrister M.K. Gandhi picked up pen and paper on May 21, 1900, in Durban, Natal, South Africa for ‘public work’. This time it was to draft and send a felicitatory cable to Queen Victoria (1819-1901) on the monarch’s 81st birthday. Herself a mother of nine and sceptical of husbands’ concern for wives, she might well have addressed to the thirty-one-year-old the remark famously (if without authentication) ascribed to her: “We are not amused.” And added the other comment of hers: “Being pregnant is an occupational hazard of being a wife.”

Already a celebrity in that British colony as an advocate for the rights of Indian South Africans, with no distinction being allowed between them and any Briton there, Gandhi’s sending that message was about good politics. But he being the man that he was, it was also, essentially, his own style. The writing of this message done, he then wrote to the Natal government to forward it to London, not forgetting to do another thing typical of him. He remitted Pound 1 to the authorities towards transmission charges.

In less than a year, Victoria was to make him put pen to paper again. When news came on January 22, 1901 of the monarch’s death, British Indians in Natal sent a cable to the royal family “... bewailing the Empire’s loss in the death of the greatest and most loved sovereign on earth.” This was, it need hardly be explained, Gandhi writing. And it was also to lead to Gandhi doing what he was to become known for: hitting the street. “On the weekend following,” he records, “a great procession was taken out in Durban from West Street to her statue and a wreath placed there, M.H. Nazar and I carrying the wreath on our shoulders.” Going further, some four weeks later, in March, he had an address on the reign of Queen Victoria delivered to Indian children in the Town Hall, Durban, and a memento distributed to each of them. This comprised a photograph of the late Queen and an extract from her Proclamation to the people of India of 1858 at the top, six dates in her life from her association with India at the bottom, a map of India (1901) showing it as a British possession and her remark, “I will be good,” when she was informed at the age of twelve that she was the future Queen of England.

His equation with the raj was going to have a complete metamorphosis. But the respect in which he held Victoria was not going to change. He was to continue to not only hold her in esteem, but publicly state that position on more than one occasion, perhaps most famously at the National Language Conference held in Calcutta on December 30, 1917. Lokamanya Tilak, presiding, spoke in English. When his turn came, Gandhi said (speaking in his own not very practiced Hindi): “It would be a great advantage if Lokamanya Tilak would speak in Hindi… Even Queen Victoria learnt Hindi.” On June 27, 1947, he said, “If an English girl of seventeen could become the British Queen and later even Empress of India there is no reason why a Bhangi girl of robust love of her people and of unimpeachable integrity of character should not become the first President of the Indian Republic.”

One hundred and twenty years after her death, it is worth reflecting on the respect in which the raj’s future and most formidable adversary held its most celebrated monarch. Three reflections emerge, on the roots of this respect and their relevance today: first, a Head of State is part of its architecture but also above it, levitating, almost, in a space that exculpates her or him from its actions’ minutiae. A ‘robust love of the people’ and ‘unimpeachable integrity’ make the occupier of that office the nation’s conscience. Not a carping, nagging trouble-maker, but an honest counsellor, unafraid because unimpeachable as to motives and means. Queen Victoria respected the prime minister’s powers and her own constitutional position as explained by Walter Bagehot. But she never doubted what she so uniquely enjoyed: influence. In a letter to Lord Salisbury dated May 27, 1898, she wrote: “The future Viceroy [of India] must… not be guided by the snobbish and vulgar, over-bearing and offensive behaviour of our Civil and Political Agents… not trying to trample on the people and continuously reminding them and making them feel they are a conquered people.” Not trying to trample on the people is not policy. It is not a directive. But it is a nostrum and one that, coming from the monarch, cannot but inform the State’s attitude to the people. And who are those? Not the ruling race, not the demographically or politically powerful but, in a country like India, all of them as a peoplehood. Equality and secularism are about letting no community feel it is a subject denomination.

Second, Victoria’s statue on West Street, Durban and her statues in Bengaluru, Chennai and Calcutta remind us, timeously (to use a South African phrase), of her respect for language and cultural difference. The handsome one in Bengaluru’s Cubbon Park, sculpted by Thomas Brock, bears inscriptions that date back to its installation at the hands of the visiting Prince of Wales — the future George V — in 1906. They are in four languages — English, Kannada, Tamil and Urdu. The raj in its imperial and colonial astuteness and correctness knew the need for balance among the different language communities in its territories. And, of course, of Victoria’s desire to ‘not trample’. Gandhi perhaps had an exaggerated notion of Victoria’s learning of Hindi (Hindustani, more accurately) but he was exactly right about the reasons for her wanting to do so. She wanted to be on a proximate, if not the same, wavelength as her Indian subjects. At least in her own mind.

Third, the statues stand, in their own quaint way, for what may be called Victoria’s federating spirit. What? An unapologetic royal standing for federalism? Strange as that may sound, it is so. She is unlikely to have studied the evolution of federal theories, or derived conceptual lessons from the American Civil War. And her 63-year-long reign (1837-1901) coincided with some of the raj’s most egregious acts against the people and the institutions of India, notably, during the governor generalship of Lord Dalhousie when princely state after princely state was outrageously annexed to British India and, in an act that has etched itself into India’s collective memory, the Koh-i-noor, a palladium of Indian sovereign pride, was snatched from its lodgement in the Punjab and presented to the Queen as a token of India’s submission to the raj. And, yet, there was in her instincts, if not quite a touch of Asokan remorse, still, a conscience about what Britain had done in India as an imperial and colonizing power, especially post-1857. That — a conscience about deeds done that should not have been done by its political class — is silent in India today. It is asleep. It snores.

We do not need lessons in political morality from a regime that took control of India without any justification, ruled over it without any compunction, and left it only when continuance had become untenable. But behind that truth the example of a Queen who had an active inner monitor with which ‘to encourage and to warn’ her government and guide her people is of value today. And this, because that monitor needs to be applied not just to the government of the day but to something even more trampling of peoples’ feelings — the ‘vulgar, overbearing and offensive’ majoritarianism that has spread among us as a society.",The inner eye,www.telegraphindia.com
113,114,https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/ladies-of-the-land/cid/1804584,"The languages we speak in, the very words we use, betray our seminal beliefs. In Bengali, for instance, there is a goalini for every goala (milkman), a methrani for every methar (scavenger), a naptini for every napit (barber), but no mahila sainik for every sainik (soldier) and no chashini for a chasha (farmer). The Hindi word kisan has no feminine form. The Gujarati word for farmer is khedut; but khedutani is not used as much. Between the fashioning of this vocabulary and now, whole contexts have changed. And that is why, when the Chief Justice of India appealed to “women” alongside children and senior citizens at Delhi’s farmers’ protests to return home, his statement elicited howls of protest. After all, the protesting women are at Singhu in their capacity as farmers as well. Indeed, a large percentage of Indian’s agricultural labour force constitutes women, no matter the gendered land ownership pattern. In Bengal, there is a new trend among women farmers. But first, farmlands here as compared to the rest of the country are small. This has to do with the aggressive land reform measures including ceilings on the upper limit of landholding implemented by the Left Front government. The average landholding size declined from 1.20 hectares in 1970-71 to 0.92 hectares in 1985-86, according to the agriculture census. There are no large farms except for tea plantations. Says Koushik Brahmachari of Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, “The number of marginal farmers is large here and in places like Bolpur and the Sunderbans, the landholdings are on a homestead scale.” Saleha Khatun of Hariharpara in Murshidabad married Sahabuddin in 2012. She was barely 16 at the time. Her husband too was young and had not completed his studies. Saleha’s father-in-law owned a one-and-a-half bigha agricultural plot and Sahabuddin helped his father till the land. What they grew on the plot was barely enough to feed the family. There was nothing left to sell. Small holdings typically yield marginal farmers next to nothing and they are ultimately forced to sell their holdings to large landholders and turn into farmhands. But that did not happen to Saleha’s family. Soumyajit Das, who is the special secretary of the Comprehensive Area Development Corporation of the panchayat department, says, “Unlike states such as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, where commercial agriculture is practised in large landholdings, in Bengal, we have fragmented landholdings that are used for backyard cultivation of vegetables, oilseeds, floriculture, fruits. Women are engaged in these.”

Saleha’s mother-in-law, Sabira Bibi, was part of the Hariharpara Nilakar Mahila Samabay, a co-operative of self-help groups (SHGs) set up in 2000. Now, there are 8,65,000-odd registered SHGs in the state. About 30-40 per cent of these are involved in agriculture, says Partha Mandal, who is the deputy general manager of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development or Nabard. The Hariharpara co-operative has 4,000 shareholders, 400 SHGs, and a corpus of 15 bighas where shareholders grow coriander, cumin, onions and sundry varieties which they sell at a profit. The way it works is this — the smallest SHG comprises 10 women. Each of them contributes anything between Rs 10 and Rs 200 per month and a corpus fund is formed. This money is used by members of SHGs to cultivate vegetables or raise poultry individually or collectively. Whatever profit the group makes, members divide among themselves equally. When a group does well, it is granted credit linkage to banks by Nabard. This means they become eligible for loans. Typically, if a loan amount of Rs 1,25,000 is given to a 10-member group, each member gets Rs 12,500. They then engage in group agricultural activity on leased land. Like her mother-in-law, Saleha too has joined the co-operative. She explains, “About 75 per cent of the profit is distributed among the women who work and 25 per cent is split among the shareholders who give out loans or engage in other group activities.” The SHGs also offer other support. When Saleha wanted to complete her master’s and BEd, the group gave her an education loan at 2 per cent interest. In 2019, the Hariharpara co-operative cultivated 15 bighas of land and made a profit of Rs 29,000. The following year, it took out a year-long lease of 18 bighas of land in Samserganj, also in Murshidabad, from local farmers. Samserganj is at least 100 kilometres away from Hariharpara, but Saleha and many of her neighbours work the fields there. Saleha explains, “We women water the plants, sow seeds, cut paddy. Men plough the field with tractors.” The co-operative cultivates onions, garlic, ginger, vegetables, turmeric, coriander seeds, cumin seeds. It has also purchased its own grinding machine and packaging machine. It seems, apart from the Comprehensive Area Development Corporation, who is their biggest customer, they have other loyal customers. Manju Bala of Uttaran Bahumukhi Sangha Primary Co-operative Society Limited from Duttapulia in Ranaghat block of Nadia district has a different story to tell. It was the floods of 2000 that sowed the seeds of community cohesiveness among residents here. Says Manju, “About 8-10 families lived together till the waters receded. It was then that we formed a self-help group — the Seema Mahila Samity.” The women collected Rs 20 from every member. Says Manju, “In addition, we took a loan of Rs 5,000.” With that money, group members started their own businesses. She adds, “Some of us bought ducks and reared them to sell their eggs, some started a whole poultry farm, while a few of us started growing vegetables, and others, flowering plants.” Vegetables and flower nurseries turned out to be profitable businesses. In the meantime, Manju’s children grew up and she, too, found the time to pass the board exams. She says, “You can’t become a trainer or keep accounts in an SHG if you haven’t passed the boards.” Next, she formed her own cluster in 2007 — the Uttaran Bahumukhi. No matter what the Sabiras, Salehas and Manjus’ contribution to the Indian agriculture scene, agricultural holdings continue to be in the name of the men of the household. The SHG movement is aimed more at empowering women economically within the traditional societal structure. Manish Anand of Delhi’s The Energy and Resources Institute has co-authored a paper on enhancing the role of women in agriculture and allied activities and providing them institutional support. He says, “Women provide critical support to the health of farmlands... Being unpaid in nature, these efforts of women are dampened as they are not recognised as primary producers. They continue to face constraints in accessing land, credit, technology, agricultural inputs, services and market opportunities.” Anand draws attention to women’s groups in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu that have managed to work around these. He says, “Federated structures of women’s co-operatives have been largely successful in Kerala.” One day, for sure, this change afoot in Bengal will cover all of the state, it will spread across the rest of India too. The accepted vocabulary will be updated; and ways of seeing will change too — even from high places.",Ladies of the Land,www.telegraphindia.com

“Foreign vaccines are a necessity until local vaccines are available,” Rouhani said in televised remarks, without giving details of what foreign vaccines would be used.

His remarks came as daily COVID-19 deaths fell to a low of more than seven months and officials announced that there were no more high-risk “red cities” in the country.

Earlier this month Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s highest authority, banned the government from importing vaccines from the United States and Britain, which he said were possibly seeking to spread the infection to other countries.

Rouhani himself, in compliance with Khamenei’s ban, said at the time that his government would purchase “safe foreign vaccines.”

Iran launched human trials of its first domestic vaccine candidate late last month, saying this could help it defeat the pandemic despite U.S. sanctions that affect its ability to import vaccines.

“There have been good movements in the field of local and foreign vaccines,” Rouhani said, adding that three domestic vaccines - Barekat, Pasteur and Razi, some of which have been developed with foreign collaboration - could begin in the spring and summer.

Cuba said earlier this month that it had signed an accord with Tehran to transfer the technology for its most advanced coronavirus vaccine candidate and carry out last-stage clinical trials of the shot in Iran.

Tehran and Havana are under tough U.S. sanctions that while they exempt medicine often deter foreign pharmaceutical companies from trading with them.

Iran is also participating in the COVAX scheme that aims to secure fair access to COVID-19 vaccines for poorer countries.

The country has recorded nearly 1.37 million cases and about 57,300 deaths, according to government data, but there has been a decline in new infections in recent weeks. Deaths fell to 69 in the 24 hours to Saturday, the health ministry said, the lowest since June 5.

“We can fortunately announce today that we have no ‘red cities’ across the country,” Alireza Raisi, spokesman for the national coronavirus task force, told state TV. But officials warned people should still follow health precautions.",Iran to begin COVID-19 vaccinations in coming weeks: President Rouhani,www.reuters.com

Some of Australia's brightest horticultural minds are trying to change that by selectively breeding for macadamias with thinner shells, larger kernels and tougher exterior husks to protect the nuts from birds and insects.

In the Queensland Alliance for Food and Agriculture's nut lab on the Sunshine Coast, Professor Bruce Topp and his team have set a cracking pace, studying nuts from a selection of 5,000 trees.

Professor Topp, the leader of Australia's macadamia breeding program, explained that just 33 per cent of the average nut is edible.

""We're looking at selecting for increased kernel recovery.""

Borers have been released into bags to test the performance of the green husks that protect the nut and kernel on macadamia trees.

""Some varieties have a thicker husk and some have have a harder husk and so one of the things that we're looking at is, can we increase the kernel recovery, but get protection for the kernel by having thicker or harder husks?"" the University of Queensland scientist explained.

Australian Macadamia Society CEO Jolyon Burnett said despite the impact of COVID-19 on service industries and duty-free sales at airports, demand for macadamias remained as strong as ever.

""People still cannot get enough macadamia nuts, whether that's here in Australia or one of the 44 countries around the world that we export to,"" Mr Burnett said.

""Every year there are new product developments that include macadamias, they are one of the few products available in over seven aisles of the supermarkets.

In 2019, growers were paid an average price of $5.81 per kilogram of nut in shell and those returns are expected to increase to $6.00 or higher when figures are tallied for last year.

Professor Topp collaborates with the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries and the University of the Sunshine Coast on projects which are funded by Horticulture Innovation Australia.

Its research and development manager, Vino Rajadran, said the $2.2 million breeding program used the best genetics available to generate the best returns for growers.

""What we're working with is a crop that hasn't really been bred for agriculture, so we're at the start of the journey.

With a few hours to go before the fight, McGregor was a -330 favorite to beat Dustin Poirier, according to Caesars Sportsbook by William Hill. Poirier was listed as a +270 underdog.

A month ago, when the fight was made official, McGregor was around a -260 favorite, but the betting action has been lopsided, causing the price to grow steadily. At William Hill books, 84% of the money wagered was on McGregor.

FanDuel reported taking $80,000, $65,000 and $55,000 bets on McGregor on Saturday, in addition to a $188,900 bet on the favorite that was placed last Friday in New Jersey. Sportsbook PointsBet said it took a $100,000 bet on McGregor last Friday.

118,119,https://hamodia.com/2021/01/23/police-clamp-russian-protests-jailing-navalny/,"Police detained more than 2,500 people and used force to break up rallies across Russia on Saturday as tens of thousands of protesters ignored extreme cold and police warnings to demand the release of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.

Navalny had called on his supporters to protest after being arrested last weekend as he returned to Russia from Germany for the first time since being poisoned with a nerve agent he says was slipped to him by state security agents in August.

The authorities had warned people to stay away from Saturday’s protests, saying they risked catching COVID-19 as well as prosecution and possible jail time for attending an unauthorized event.

But protesters defied the ban and, in at least one case in temperatures below -50 Celsius (-58 Fahrenheit), turned out in force. Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally, called on them to do the same next weekend to try to free Navalny from what he called “the clutches of his killers.”

In central Moscow, where Reuters reporters estimated at least 40,000 people had gathered in one of the biggest unauthorized rallies for years, police were seen roughly detaining people, bundling them into nearby vans.

The authorities said just some 4,000 people had shown up, while the Foreign Ministry questioned Reuters’s crowd estimate.

“Why not just immediately say four million?” it suggested sarcastically on its official Telegram messenger channel.

Ivan Zhdanov, a Navalny ally, put turnout in the capital at 50,000, the Proekt media outlet reported.

Some protesters chanted “Putin is a thief” and “Disgrace!” and “Freedom to Navalny!”

Navalny’s wife Yulia was briefly detained at the rally before being released. Some of Navalny’s political allies were detained in the days before the protest, others on the day itself.

At one point, protesters surrounded a sleek black car with a flashing light used by senior officials, throwing snowballs at it and kicking it. A group of policemen were also pelted with snowballs by a much bigger crowd.

The OVD-Info protest monitor group said that at least 2,509 people, including 952 in Moscow and 374 in St Petersburg, had been detained at rallies in around 100 towns and cities.

The United States condemned what it described as “harsh tactics” used against protesters and journalists and called for Navalny’s “immediate and unconditional” release.

“We call on Russian authorities to release all those detained for exercising their universal rights,” U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.

Navalny, a 44-year-old lawyer, is in a Moscow prison pending the outcome of four legal matters he describes as trumped up. He accuses President Vladimir Putin of ordering his attempted murder. Putin has dismissed that, alleging Navalny is part of a U.S.-backed dirty tricks campaign to discredit him.

Some protesters marched on the prison, where police were waiting to arrest them.

Images of protesters with injuries such as bloodied heads circulated on social media.

The scenes were reminiscent of the months-long unrest in Russia’s neighboring ally Belarus where anti-government protests flared last August over allegations of voter fraud.

There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, which had previously called the protests illegal and the work of “provocateurs.”

State prosecutors said they would look into alleged violence against police officers by protesters.

In Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, nearly 1,000 people demonstrated against Navalny’s arrest. Small demonstrations were also held in Bulgaria and some 200-300 people protested in Paris.

Police in Siberia’s Yakutsk, one of the coldest cities in the world, where the temperature was -52 Celsius (-62 F) on Saturday, grabbed a protester by his arms and legs and dragged him into a van, video footage showed.

In Moscow, some journalists covering the protests were detained, drawing a rebuke from the U.S. Embassy.

“Russian authorities arresting peaceful protesters, journalists,” spokesperson Rebecca Ross said on social media. “Appears to be a concerted campaign to suppress free speech, peaceful assembly.”

There were outages on mobile phone and internet services, the monitoring site downdetector.ru showed, a tactic sometimes used by authorities to make it harder for protesters to communicate among themselves.

In a push to galvanize support ahead of the protests, Navalny’s team released a video this week about an opulent palace on the Black Sea they alleged belonged to Putin, something the Kremlin denied. As of Saturday the clip had been viewed more than 70 million times.

Navalny’s allies hope to tap into what polls say are pent-up frustrations among the public over years of falling wages and economic fallout from the pandemic.

But Putin’s grip on power looks unassailable for now and the 68-year-old president regularly records an approval rating of over 60%, much higher than that of Navalny.",Police Clamp Down on Russian Protests Against Jailing of Navalny | .com,hamodia.com
119,120,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/the-business-of-speaking-out-when-few-others-do/cid/1804617,"An industrialist has uttered in public what Arnab Goswami would hear out in private but did not dare declare from his TV pulpit. “Out of 7 crore entrepreneurs, MSMEs (micro small and medium enterprises), 30 per cent are almost dead. What is 30 per cent? 2.1 crore…. That 2.1 crore give jobs for almost 20 crore people. They are not bothered,” K.E. Raghunathan told Rahul Gandhi at an interaction in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, on Saturday. “We are seeing only the balance 60 per cent and saying ‘greenshoots’. I am seeing shooting myself as an entrepreneur. How are we progressing?

What answer will I give to my children?” added Raghunathan. “You are the only voice for us. Don’t forget it,” he told Rahul.

Raghunathan is the convener and spokesperson for the Consortium of Indian Associations that he said represents over 3.5 lakh industrial units.

Since the lockdown was gradually eased, the Modi government has been claiming to have spied “greenshoots” of recovery on an otherwise bleak economic landscape. Few industrialists, barring Rahul Bajaj, have voiced so bluntly the concerns of industry although many businessmen and corporate chiefs are known to be candid, if not withering, in private and all praise for the government in public.

The double standard was on display last week when purported WhatsApp chats between Republic TV managing director Goswami and the then BARC chief Partho Dasgupta became public.

In one set of chats on the eve of the 2019 general election, a purported message from Dasgupta tells Goswami: “NM/AS should first rejig finance ministry in the second term — the economy is screwed — no matter what we tell outside.”

Goswami, usually quick on the draw to duel on behalf of the Modi regime, did not only not challenge Dasgupa but agreed “totally” with the ratings boss that Arun Jaitley, the then finance minister, was “their biggest failure”.

In Coimbatore on Saturday, Raghunathan, who came from Chennai for the programme, did not pull any punches when his turn to speak came.

“What are we witnessing today in this country? We moved from Skill India to Digital India to Make in India to Atmanirbhar now. And finally ended where? Fund India. What is Fund India? FDI… asking others to give us money,” he said, drawing applause from the rest of the audience.

As high as 98 per cent of these industries are micro units, which he defined as small businesses run by groups of self-employed people with an annual turnover of less than Rs 5 crore. But today, the dreams of the start-ups are “shattered”, he said, adding: “We are losing them.”

Asserting that micro industries were not on an equal footing with small and medium industries, Raghunathan said a separate ministry for micro enterprises was a must.

He put in a nutshell the key problems being faced by entrepreneurs: “3M” or lack of “money, manpower and material”.

“Banks are chasing us, the NBFCs (non-banking finance companies) are chasing us,” said Raghunathan.

The MSMEs were left high and dry after the economy was rocked by the Covid-19 pandemic as banks were reluctant to lend to borrowers whose fortunes had turned uncertain. The Centre announced a collateral-free loan scheme for MSMEs as part of the Atmanirbhar package and the initial plan was to limit it to 45 lakh units.

Raghunathan is basically complaining that the MSME universe has more than 7 crore establishments and the provision of collateral-free credit to 45 lakh borrowers would only scratch the surface of the problem.

The MSMEs provide large-scale employment in the country and their survival is crucial to tackling unemployment — a problem that the Modi has failed to address in the six and a half years he has been at the helm of the Union government.

Raghunathan later told The Telegraph over the phone that he had taken part in the interaction “to draw the attention of the government to these burning issues”.

“Rahul Gandhi is a national leader who can understand the gravity of the situation,” he said.

Raghunathan, former president of the All India Manufacturers Organisation, added: “Rahul gave me a patient hearing and, during lunch, told me that he was touched by my statement. Entrepreneurs cannot cry openly, for if they did, nobody will give business. But everybody is crying today.”",The business of speaking out when few others do,www.telegraphindia.com

(CSE:COOL)(OTC PINK:CLABF)(Frankfurt:LD62)(WKN:A2P8K3) (the 'Company') is pleased to announce its wholly-owned subsidiary Vocan Biotechnologies Inc. ('Vocan') has assembled the necessary equipment, which will allow the laboratory to commence the process of recombinant production of psilocybin. The process that engineers bacteria incorporating optimized biosynthetic genes from the Psilocybe cubensis mushroom, will enable the bacteria to act as a biological factory and synthesize psilocybin that is cost effective using simple building blocks.

Vocan's platform can make the active compounds that occur naturally, by using a gene mimicry process and simple chemical modifications to enable the creation of bioidentical compounds as well as known and novel analogs. The analog compounds could prove to be more effective, targeted and safer.

Vocan has now received and assembled equipment required to move forward on its plan to produce biosynthesized psilocybin. Due to the cost and long lead times, this is a critical milestone in the company's plan. The equipment enables Vocan to improve on the current work being conducted in the lab and puts Vocan ahead of schedule on its plan to begin the recombinant production of psilocybin.

'Vocan's recombinant production of psilocybin is a significant improvement over the current methods of psilocybin production. Reducing both the cost and time needed to produce and purify psilocybin to only a few days, compared to much longer and more expensive methods for whole mushroom extraction. Having the equipment purchased and assembled positions Vocan to execute on its objectives in the short term.' Stated Joel Shacker CEO of the Company.

Further to the Company's press release dated January 15, 2021 announcing the closing of its sale of non-core assets, the Company wishes to correct that it has issued a total of 500,000 common shares as an administrative fee to three arms-length third-parties who assisted with facilitating such sale, not 350,000 shares to two parties, as previously announced.

122,123,https://journalrecord.com/2021/01/22/warren-depolarizing-politics-at-work/,"With spending estimated at over $14 billion, it was hard to escape the rhetoric fostered by one of the most disagreeable and expensive campaigns in American history. Many internalized the politics of the day, causing people to become increasingly polarized.

Divisiveness has been further exacerbated by silos on social media, choice of news feeds pandering to harsh notions about opposing parties, racial divides, religious beliefs and even geographical separation between rural and urban communities. Stereotypes have emerged making nebulous associations of party affiliation with everything from coffee consumption to the clothes we wear.

Try a little test yourself: Visualize someone wearing camo – are they a Democrat or Republican? What about someone who frequents Starbucks vs. Dunkin Donuts? When surveyed, Reds were unconsciously associated with camo and Blues with Starbucks. If you didn’t connect a party with either scenario, then your company needs your help in putting back together our fractured workforces.

While many companies are making positive strides with communications programs like Crucial Conversations, these are not enough to overcome the pervasive underlying suspicions harbored, often subconsciously, about those with opposing views. Nor can issues be addressed through traditional diversity training. Those are important tools and organizations embracing them will be a step ahead, but political depolarization is a bit different.

Enter Braver Angels, a bipartisan 501(c)3 group dedicated to constructive conversations to diffuse polarizing political rhetoric. The good news is that Democrats and Republicans alike are equal contributors to the process of truth-seeking and civil discourse. Nobody feels attacked or undermined in grappling with tough issues. It is based on the realization that each individual has a piece of the proverbial puzzle. To that end, Schnake Turnbo Frank’s Inclusion and Diversity Consortium will be offering a one-hour virtual learning opportunity on Jan. 27 to explore ways to bridge cultural divides and help employees engage in proactive dialogue.

Organizations depend on teamwork to get the job done. Unfortunately, politics have manifested into a visceral dislike and distrust for one another. It is difficult for organizations to promote cooperation and collaboration when hostility abounds. Ironically, there is a positive launching point for better conversations: Members of both parties share a common desire to end the ongoing divisiveness. Employers must provide tools to help them navigate these contentious times, build cohesive workplaces and strengthen community.

The Grammy Award-winning DJ/producer superduo absolutely shine on the track, celebrating the classic house and disco sounds that have inspired them so much throughout their careers. “New Love” rocks nostalgic dance elements and a smooth, zesty groove of its own, as Ellie Goulding’s powerhouse voice cuts through the mix with feel-good attitude. It’s a new school approach to a tried and true method, and we fall a little more in love with the track with each listen.

I’ve known Mark and Wes for years and it seemed only right to make a tune together, at a time where we all need to dance and be free, even if just in our kitchens. The song is about losing yourself on your own, not needing to be seen, knowing that the one that got away could be just as happy as this too. The main concept is dancing on your own not needing to be seen. – Ellie Goulding

Named after the Philadelphia diner where the pair first met more than 20 years ago, Silk City is a celebration of classic dance music. After decades of friendship, Diplo and Ronson entered the studio together in 2018 and churned out hits — “Only Can Get Better” featuring Daniel Merriweather, “Feel About You” featuring Mapei, “Loud” with GoldLink and Desiigner, and “Electricity” with Dua Lipa.

125,126,https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/stimulus-check-lost-in-the-mail-probably-not-11-things-causing-a-holdup/,"If you haven't received your second stimulus check by now, you probably won't -- at least not without claiming it on your taxes this year. That's because the IRS had a Jan. 15 deadline to make stimulus payments.

And while millions of qualified recipients didn't get their payments before the cutoff, there may be other reasons beyond the deadline as to why your check is a no-show, including a banking error or other logistical snag.

Here are some reasons that your second stimulus payment could be delayed, and why the IRS Get My Payment tool isn't showing you the current status of your check. Here's how to claim a missing payment and how to contact the IRS -- including to request a payment trace. And here's everything to know about the next stimulus check. This story is frequently updated.

You used TurboTax, Jackson Hewitt, H&R Block or another tax service for your 2019 taxes

With the first checks the IRS and US Treasury sent last year to bank accounts, millions of people who used a tax preparer like TurboTax or H&R Block may have run into trouble receiving their payment via direct deposit.

The problem stemmed from the IRS sending payments to temporary bank accounts used by the tax preparation services (this is normal and routine). Those temporary accounts that didn't line up with actual people were rejected, causing millions of people a delay in receiving their allocated second stimulus money. The IRS has acknowledged the problem and says it's in the process of fixing it.

Jackson Hewitt, TurboTax and H&R Block alerted their customers that they saw similar issues with the second round of payments. Customers who don't receive their payment through direct deposit as expected will need to claim their money through the Recovery Rebate Credit on their federal tax return this year, which will delay their payment delivery by weeks or months. Tax preparation companies are expected to provide affected customers with more detailed information about what to do.

Did you close the bank account the IRS has on file?



If you closed the bank account the government has on file for you, your payment will get returned without ever reaching your hands.

The IRS said it has a handful of ways to find your banking information, including from your 2019 tax return, from the IRS' Get My Payment app or Non-Filer app if you used it last year, or from another federal agency that uses your banking details to issue benefits, such as the Social Security Administration.

If the IRS has out-of-date bank deposit info for you, the banking institution will return the payment to the government and you'll need to claim the amount you're owed on your 2020 tax return as a Recovery Rebate Credit. Note that if your benefits are deposited to a Direct Express card, your second stimulus payment will also be deposited to that card, the IRS said.

If you don't usually file a tax return, did you need to take an extra step?

The IRS said it will automatically send payments to those who receive Social Security retirement, survivor or disability benefits (SSDI) or Railroad Retirement benefits, as well as to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Veterans Affairs beneficiaries who didn't file a tax return. With the first checks, however, some of these recipients, loosely termed nonfilers, needed to take an additional step to claim a check. If you haven't received your payment by the time tax season starts, the IRS recommends you submit a federal tax return to request your payment.

Are you sure you qualify to receive the second stimulus check?

This might be a painful answer, but if you've used the IRS' Get My Payment tool to check on the status of your payment and you see the message ""Payment Status Not Available,"" you may not be eligible to receive a stimulus payment. If you want to double-check that, we have a stimulus check calculator to give you a quick idea of whether you qualify for a payment and for how much.

It might be that your adjusted gross income from the previous year is high enough that you don't qualify. That's the tax-related income figure the IRS uses as part of the formula to calculate your payment. We have a handy primer on eligibility, or you can check the IRS website directly.

• If you're part of the .
• If you're not a US citizen or if you're a citizen who lives abroad .
• If you're a US citizen who's a spouse or child of .

If you moved, does the IRS have your new address?

If you moved and didn't inform the IRS and USPS, your physical stimulus check or EIP card might not find you. Though you may need to ultimately claim your next stimulus check during tax season, you'll still want to change your address in anticipation of the third stimulus check President-elect Joe Biden is already talking about.

Could your check have been mistakenly garnished to cover unpaid debts?



With the first check, there were several situations where your check could be diverted to cover certain debts, including to cover past-due child support.

For the second check, Congress did away with many of the situations where creditors and debt collectors could garnish your payment -- including to pay overdue child support. But your bank may still be able to use your second check to cover overdraft fees.

The IRS might not have your current banking information

For the first check, the IRS used banking information from your 2018 or 2019 tax return to send your payment. For the second check, the IRS said it's using just your 2019 tax return.

Some tax preparers, however, set up temporary accounts for their clients. If this is the information the IRS had for you with the first check, the agency said, the payment was returned and reprocessed.

Though the IRS hasn't provided information on how it'll handle this situation for the second $600 checks, we recommend checking the Get My Payment tool once it's available again, and, if you don't receive your payment, requesting it when you file your federal taxes this year.

Make sure any dependents you claimed qualify for $600 each



In general, parents who aren't married to each other and don't file a joint return can't claim a qualifying child as a dependent. The parent who claimed the child on the 2019 tax return may receive the payment. Likewise, dependent college students don't qualify for a payment.

But there's a loophole that applied to the first stimulus check that allowed non-married parents in child support situations, filing separately, who claimed a dependent in alternate years, to each receive the $500 payment per qualified dependent. Confusing, yes. It isn't clear if that would also apply to the $600-per-child in the second stimulus check.

Make sure you didn't throw away the envelope containing your payment



With the first payment, some people reported accidentally throwing out the envelope containing their check, not recognizing that it contained a stimulus payment. The IRS recommends you watch your mail for a white envelope with the US Department of the Treasury seal. If you receive a prepaid debit card, it'll have the Visa name on the front of the card and the issuing bank, MetaBank, N.A., on the back.

You could potentially be the victim of a scam



The FBI and IRS warn that scammers are looking to steal your stimulus check. We have a guide for how to guard against and report these attacks. With the first checks, the IRS sent a letter notifying you that the agency had sent your money -- with details on whether it came through the mail or straight to your bank -- and with information on how to report if the money didn't arrive. The IRS said it's sending a similar letter for the second checks.

Again, your check may've missed the Jan. 15 deadline

The IRS and Treasury pushed to meet the Jan. 15 deadline to process payments. But with the agencies having to churn out tens of millions of payments in 17 days (from Dec. 29 through Jan. 15, including weekends), we can expect that some stimulus checks didn't make the final sprint. In that case, you'll need to claim your missing money through the IRS' Recovery Rebate Credit during tax season.

126,127,https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/category/news/income-financial-trust-declares-monthly-distribution-4/,"HONG KONG SAR – Media OutReach – 22 February 2021 – 2020 proved to be a great year for Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs). The market saw more high-profile investors joining the party while a record number of companies went public through this unique structure. With a whopping US$80 billion raised by over 230 blank-cheque companies, SPAC IPOs not only represented approximately 50% of total IPO issuance in the US in 2020, the massive amount raised by SPACs even eclipsed traditional IPOs last year.

While SPACs continue to be favoured by institutional and private investors alike in the US, they are also gaining momentum in Asia. Savvy investors in the East are catching up fast with the trend and among them is Black Spade Capital Limited, the family office of casino magnate Lawrence Ho Yau Lung.

“We aim to be one of the first Asian family offices to build an SPAC-themed portfolio,” said Mr. Dennis Tam, President and CEO of Black Spade Capital. He added that “of course, we have to be selective — only high-quality SPACs with great potential are considered”.

Mr. Tam considers the current close-to-zero or, in some cases, negative interest rate environment as one of the catalysts that contribute to the success of SPAC IPOs. “Loose monetary policy means lower cost of funds and greater incentive for investors to look for new investments. SPACs enjoy a great start this year with over US$45 billion raised by more than 140 new SPACs to-date — the fact that both the number and size of SPAC deals in the first two months of 2021 represent some 56% of the full-year performance in 2020 reflects just how buoyant the SPAC market is. The whole SPAC trend has to do to a certain extent with the abundance of capital in the market seeking return. When the interest rate picks up, the trend may slow down” said Mr. Tam.

Mr. Tam commented that the family office places importance on the sponsors in terms of selection criteria. “There are two main criteria — sponsors’ reputation and their track record. Sponsors are the face of an SPAC. They set out the road map of the investment vehicle. Their track record gives us a glimpse of what the sponsors are capable of. I always find one-on-one investor meeting a good way to learn about the vision and strategy that the sponsors have for their SPACs. A reputable sponsor boosts investor confidence. Some people point out that sponsors typically receive 20% of the equity in the SPAC; in my opinion, this mechanism helps align sponsors’ interest with that of investors which is actually positive — as long as the sponsors deliver, they deserve a matching reward. After all, if the sponsors successfully acquire or merge with a promising target (i.e. de-SPAC), everybody wins” explained Mr. Tam.

The relatively straightforward structure of SPACs also begins to appeal to many family offices. “As the name suggests, an SPAC has the sole purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public. The tenor is usually capped at two years and the sector from which the SPAC identifies its acquisition target is announced before the SPAC is listed. The fund raised by an SPAC usually serves as a good indication of the size of the future target, which is typically 3x to 4x the size of the SPAC. This is the kind of clarity that investors appreciate,” explained Mr. Tam. “Also, SPAC issuers offer to redeem the shares from investors at a call price equivalent to the IPO price if they do not like the acquisition target. This capital protection mechanism affords greater assurance to investors” added Mr. Tam.

Mr. Tam believes that investor education will encourage more Asian family offices as well as other investors in the region to participate in this SPAC trend. “We had several rounds of in-depth discussions with various investment banks and private banks before making our first SPAC investment last year,” recalled Mr. Tam. “In the process, our bankers get to understand our investment appetite and selection criteria and are able to introduce different SPAC opportunities to us” said Mr. Tam.

In terms of Black Spade Capital’s target return with regard to SPACs, “We have seen some truly impressive performance of certain star SPACs, such as QuantumScape and Draft Kings, which have realized a return of close to 10x and 4x, respectively, in 2020. Naturally, we look for above average return and we believe the key to achieve this is to invest in quality SPACs at the time of IPO” said Mr. Tam.

Black Spade Capital Limited is an established family office that manages the private investments of Mr. Lawrence Ho. Headquartered in Hong Kong, its global portfolio consists of a wide spectrum of cross-border investments as it consistently seeks to add new projects and opportunities to its investment mix. Black Spade’s investment strategy maximizes coverage of geographic regions and sectors whilst maintaining a portfolio of diversified asset classes, ranging from equity, fixed income, medical technology, leisure and culture, green energy, real estate to Pre-IPO investments.",Income Financial Trust Declares Monthly Distribution,www.globalbankingandfinance.com

129,130,https://www.princegeorgecitizen.com/news/national-news/spartan-bioscience-says-health-canada-has-approved-its-rapid-covid-19-test-1.24271897,"TORONTO — The federal government has approved an Ottawa company's made-in-Canada rapid COVID-19 test, Health Canada confirmed Saturday as the nation's top doctor warned the virus's impact on the health-care system showed no signs of abating.

The test developed by Spartan Bioscience is performed by a health-care professional and provides on-site results within an hour, a spokeswoman for the federal agency said.

Spartan bills the test as the first ""truly mobile, rapid PCR test for COVID-19 for the Canadian market.""

""The Spartan system will be able to provide quality results to remote communities, industries and settings with limited lab access, helping relieve the burden on overwhelmed healthcare facilities,"" the company said in a news release Saturday.

The company originally unveiled a rapid test for COVID-19 last spring but had to voluntarily recall it and perform additional studies after Health Canada expressed some reservations.

At the time, Spartan said Health Canada was concerned about the ""efficacy of the proprietary swab"" for the testing product.

The new version uses ""any nasopharyngeal swab"" rather than one of the company's own design, Health Canada said, and meets the agency's requirements for both safety and effectiveness.

The Spartan COVID-19 System was developed through clinical evaluation completed in Canada and the U.S., with the University of Ottawa Heart Institute as one of the testing locations.

The company said it has already started production on the rapid tests.

The news comes as Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, warned that COVID-19 continues to strain the health-care system even as daily case counts decline in several long-standing hot spots.

""As severe outcomes lag behind increased disease activity, we can expect to see ongoing heavy impacts on our healthcare system and health workforce for weeks to come,"" she said in a written statement.

Surging new infection rates continued to show signs of easing in multiple provinces, though one jurisdiction was poised to impose new restrictions in a bid to stem the ongoing spread.

Public health officials in New Brunswick reported 17 new cases across the province, 10 of which were in the Edmundston region, which was set to go into a lockdown first thing Sunday morning.

Starting at midnight, non-essential travel is prohibited in and out of the area, which borders northern Maine and Quebec's Bas-St-Laurent region.

The health order forces the closure of all non-essential businesses as well as schools and public spaces, including outdoor ice rinks and ski hills. All indoor and outdoor gatherings among people of different households are prohibited.

Saskatchewan, meanwhile, logged 274 new cases of the virus and three new deaths, while Manitoba counted three more deaths and 216 new diagnoses.

Alberta logged 573 new cases and 13 virus-related deaths in the past 24 hours, while both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador reported no new infections on Saturday.

Both Quebec and Ontario reported fewer cases Saturday — 1,685 and 2,359 respectively.

But officials in Ontario expressed concern about a highly contagious U.K. variant of the virus that was detected at a long-term care facility north of Toronto.

Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit confirmed the variant was behind the outbreak at Roberta Place Retirement Lodge in Barrie, Ont., where 32 residents have died of COVID-19 and dozens of others have tested positive.

""Stringent and consistent efforts are needed to sustain a downward trend in case counts and strongly suppress COVID-19 activity across Canada,"" Tam said. ""This will not only prevent more tragic outcomes, but will help to ensure that new virus variants of concern do not have the opportunity to spread.""

Fears of variants that can circulate quickly come as the federal government considers a mandatory quarantine in hotels for travellers returning to Canada.

How it’s going: well, she’s gone. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Back in 2017, for a first-term Trudeau government still gaga about communicating via symbols rather than words, Julie Payette was pure stardom. Literally. An astronaut, a pilot, a brilliant scientist, a single parent, a woman. In contrast to predecessors such as the Viscount Willingdon or the Earl of Bessborough, she seemed a thoroughly modern choice as the Queen’s representative in Canada. By now, we are all familiar with the extent to which she was a thoroughly terrible choice. And while academic Twitter is breathless with issues of precedence and what happens next, and the rest-of-us Twitter engages in speculation over who will replace her, perhaps it would be prudent to take a step back and put on our HR hats, reviewing the job description before making the next hire.

The position itself is a peculiar one. Parliamentary duties include summoning, proroguing and dissolving Parliament, reading the Speech from the Throne, and providing Royal Assent, by which acts of Parliament become law.

 Then there is the governor general’s function as Commander-in-Chief of Canada, rallying troops and visiting military bases on behalf of Her Majesty. It is the last, less defined part of the role that captures the most attention from Canadians. The one that encompasses general duties as consoler, congratulator, and booster-in-chief. Duties that ought to mostly be a joy to perform. Who wouldn’t be lifted by visiting and delighting enthusiastic schoolchildren, standing as patron to worthy volunteer organizations and handing out Orders of Canada to people on some of the happiest days of their lives? All within the idyllic surrounding of Rideau Hall, one of the prettiest settings in Canada. As jobs go, who wouldn’t be buoyed by it? Apparently not Ms. Payette, who, according to an independent review of her workplace practices, instead spent her time being miserable and making those around her miserable, while doing less official work than those who came before her. But what should come next? More Canadians say “no” to this country remaining a constitutional monarchy for generations to come than say “yes.” For the time being, however, Canada’s head of state remains Queen Elizabeth, and someone needs to act for her while she is here.

The mere existence of the job is a sensitive subject. It comes with a salary of nearly $300,000 annually, a home at Rideau Hall, plus perks that include drivers, and a generous life-after-governing-general package that includes money for support staff and projects. Such courtesies were no doubt once meant to fit the entitlement of overseas nobility appointed by the monarch to a role steeped in a world of class structure. But it is a different world today. The role must reflect the people it is intended to serve, not just Elizabeth Regina. In 2021, at a time when worries about being seen as too elitist have the prime minister himself too scared to fix the house in which he’s supposed to be living, and given that Payette herself refused to even reside at Rideau Hall, should a home and all its associated domestic trappings still come with the job? Would Canadians be better served if the whole building were opened up to them, as a gallery, or museum, or place of learning? If the role is primarily a constitutional function, couldn’t a qualified jurist pull double duty, in the way Chief Justice Richard Wagner of the Supreme Court of Canada is now managing? The prime minister holds the dubious distinction of being the only hiring manager to ever have botched the process as badly as this. The history and weight of this position is too important to screw up again. If a key part of the job’s function ultimately is public relations (for lack of a more elegant phrase), the prime minister must choose someone who actually likes people, wants to interact with them and knows how to treat them well. It’s all about the soft skills. More On This Topic

Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are now in their 777th day of unjust imprisonment by China’s dictators and U.S. President Joe Biden can help to free them.

Canada’s two Michaels have been caught in a legal and diplomatic tug of war between the U.S. and China ever since the Trudeau government honoured Canada’s extradition treaty with the Americans and arrested Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on Dec. 1, 2018.

She’s wanted in the U.S. on charges of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran.

Meng has denied the allegations, while her extradition trial in Vancouver lumbers along.

In retaliation against Canada for arresting Meng, China’s dictators imprisoned Kovrig and Spavor, ostensibly on charges of spying but really in order to engage in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has rightly described as hostage diplomacy.

That is, trading Meng for our two Michaels, who have been held in harsh conditions in China, with limited contacts to the outside world.",EDITORIAL: Biden can help free Canada's two Michaels,torontosun.com
135,136,https://www.timminstoday.com/national-news/couple-charged-after-travelling-to-yukon-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-3287290,"WHITEHORSE — A cabinet minister says a couple from outside Yukon travelled to a remote community in the territory this week and received doses of COVID-19 vaccine.

Community Services Minister John Streiker says he's outraged the man and woman allegedly chartered a flight to Beaver Creek, the most westerly community in Canada near the border with Alaska, to get the shots.

Streiker says he heard Thursday night that the Canadian couple arrived in Yukon on Tuesday and declared they would follow the territory's mandatory two-week self-isolation protocol, but instead travelled to Beaver Creek.

He says the two people have been charged under Yukon's Civil Emergency Measures Act for failure to self-isolate and failure to behave in a manner consistent with their declaration upon arrival.

Streiker says the couple allegedly presented themselves as visiting workers, misleading staff at the mobile vaccination clinic in Beaver Creek.

He says territorial enforcement officers received a call about the couple, who were later intercepted at the Whitehorse airport trying to leave Yukon.

The maximum fine under the emergency measures act is $500, and up to six months in jail.

The RCMP have been notified, he said in an interview on Friday.

Streiker hadn't confirmed where the couple are from, but he said they didn't show Yukon health cards at the vaccination clinic.

Yukon has two vaccination teams that are visiting communities throughout the territory with priority going to residents and staff of group-living settings, health-care workers, people over 80 who aren't living in long-term care, and Yukoners living in rural, remote and First Nation communities.

Beaver Creek was chosen as a priority community to receive doses of COVID-19 vaccine because it's a remote border community, he said.

Yukon's chief medical officer of health has indicated he believes the risk to the community as a result of the couple's visit is low, Streiker added.

Streiker said there may be more scrutiny at vaccine clinics when people show up from outside Yukon, but officials are still working through options to prevent such a situation from happening again.

""I find it frustrating because what that does is it makes more barriers,"" he said. ""We've been trying to remove all barriers to get the vaccine for our citizens and so if there's another sort of layer of check, I just don't want it to make it harder for Yukoners to get their vaccines.""

Moscow 

More than 2,100 people were arrested by early on Saturday evening during protests in Russia calling for the release of leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny, according to volunteer platform OVD Info, which documented the number of people arrested nationwide.

The highest number of arrests was initially made in Moscow, with around 800, followed by more than 300 in St Petersburg, OVD Info reported.

Russian human rights activists listed a total of around 100 cities where protesters were taken into police custody; in most of them the arrests were isolated.

Observers spoke of tens of thousands of participants in the protests across the country. The opposition announced new protests for the coming weekend.

More arrests were expected in the evening. In Moscow alone, hundreds of people were still on the move in the city centre after dark.

Police called on them to go home. Streets were closed. 

Protesters gathered in cities across the length and breadth of Russia, from the far eastern city of Khabarovsk to Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast, for some of the largest demonstrations seen under President Vladimir Putin.

Participants chanted not only “Freedom for Navalny”, but also “Putin, go away!” At least 300 detentions were reported in the largest protest in the capital Moscow, according to volunteer platform OVD-Info, where Navalny’s team said 40,000 people had marched in support of Navalny.

Dozens of people were injured in later clashes between police and protesters, according to dpa reporters in Moscow’s central Pushkin Square.

Hundreds of people remained gathered in the city centre as evening fell. Police called on them to go home and blocked off several streets around the Kremlin.

Protesters broke through metal barriers and threw snowballs and fireworks at police, who responded with batons against the overwhelmingly young demonstrators.

More than 40 officers received minor injuries during the protest in the capital, state agency Tass reported, with media reports suggesting demonstrators were also injured. Exact figures were not immediately available.

Navlany’s wife Yulia Navalnaya was among those briefly detained. She posted a picture of herself in a dark space on Instagram with the caption: “Sorry for the poor quality. The light in the police van is very poor.” 

A previous picture on her feed showed her attending the Moscow protest. She was reportedly released several hours later. Navalny’s team had also posted a picture of his mother at the unauthorised event.

Close Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol, a lawyer, was also detained.

On the streets in Moscow were many young people and members of the middle class. Activists and journalists had earlier said the internet had been shut down.

Passing cars honked their horns in solidarity for the demonstrators.

“I don’t want to live in a Russia like we have now,” 30-year-old Irina told a dpa reporter. “We have no democracy.” Earlier, detentions were reported in cities across the country’s far east, where demonstrations began hours earlier due to the time difference.

Navalny’s team said thousands of demonstrators turned out in the cities of Khabarovsk, Irkutsk and Novosibirsk, braving freezing-cold temperatures.

Crowds shouted slogans including: “We have the power” and “Putin is a thief.” 

Earlier this week, Navalny’s team released a video titled “A Palace for Putin,” claiming to show that the long-standing leader has built a “tsarist empire” on the Black Sea funded by bribes.

The Kremlin has dismissed the accusations as a “lie.” In Khabarovsk, protests also focused on the arrest of the city’s popular former governor, Sergei Furgal.

In the Siberian city of Tomsk, where Navalny was poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent in August, his supporters were expected to stage the largest unauthorised protest in decades.

Navalny has blamed the chemical attack on Putin and the FSB intelligence service - charges which the Kremlin denies.

The rallies were not sanctioned by authorities, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warning people not to take part. Russia has banned all protests during the pandemic.

Navalny, who returned from receiving treatment in Germany last weekend, was sentenced to 30 days of pre-trial detention at a snap trial on Monday.

Navalny and his team have dismissed allegations of parole violations as a politically motivated attempt to silence him.

Authorities have also clamped down on Navalny’s associates and supporters, detaining several of his aides, including his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh.","More than 2,000 arrested as Navalny protests sweep Russia",www.qatar-tribune.com
138,139,https://www.middleeaststar.com/news/267625587/who-warns-of-diseases-spreading-in-tigray-because-of-conflict,"GENEVA - The World Health Organization is warning that conflict in Ethiopia's northern Tigray province and the consequent disruption of health services could lead to the spread of deadly diseases there.

Ethiopia's November military assault on Tigray has caused a major break in the humanitarian pipeline there. The United Nations estimates that over 4.5 million people, about half of them children, need assistance.

The WHO and other agencies have been granted only limited access to the region. WHO officials who recently visited the area say many hospitals and clinics are only partially functioning, health care workers have been displaced and essential services have been disrupted.

WHO health emergency officer Teresa Zakaria warns the disruption of essential health services has severe consequences for the population, particularly children.

""From January to November last year, over 400 cases of measles in children were reported,"" she said. ""With disruptions to routine vaccination, this number may increase significantly in the near future. Over 9,000 cases of malaria were recorded and when compounded with malnutrition, fatality due to malaria among children can increase up to threefold.""

WHO reports the incidence of COVID-19 in the Tigray region is higher than the average for the country. Up to November, more than 6,700 COVID-19 cases and 47 deaths had been reported. Zakaria says COVID-19 response activities initially were shut down and have been slow to pick up, posing a major health risk.

She says referral hospitals cannot accept patients with serious conditions. This, she warns could lead to a surge in preventable illness and death if health services are not resumed immediately.

""With most disease prevention activities interrupted and based on what we know of past history of outbreaks, the risk of spread of COVID-19, measles, cholera, malaria, yellow fever and meningitis is very real,"" Zakaria said. ""And other health conditions are also left untreated. However, without a functional disease surveillance system, we are not able to gauge the epidemiological situation and we are flying blind.""

WHO says with the help of other organizations it has been able to send needed medicines and supplies to health facilities in Tigray, but much more needs to be done.

It is calling for greater access to the region and for more financial support from donors. To date, it has received less than half of the $9.8 million it says it needs for its humanitarian operation.",WHO Warns of Diseases Spreading in Tigray Because of Conflict,www.middleeaststar.com
139,140,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/going-bananas-over-fruit/cid/1804611,"Harry Houdini is no longer the unparalleled master of the vanishing trick. The Bharatiya Janata Party in Gujarat believes that it has pulled off a Houdini. The chief minister, Vijay Rupani, has renamed the dragon fruit as ‘Kamalam’, in the hope that this sleight of hand would purge this fruit of its symbolic connection with China — the fire-breathing mythical creature has had, in the public eye, the ‘Made in China’ tag embossed on it for ages. The disdain of Mr Rupani’s party for history is well-documented. There is now evidence that the BJP scoffs at geography too. The dragon fruit originated in Mexico, not China; the alteration of geographical borders by China could not be prevented under the BJP’s watch either. The failure, so far, to re-establish the status quo has forced the BJP — none should doubt its muscle-flexing or patriotism — to do the next best thing: indulge in futile, comical efforts to erase Chinese imprints, real or imagined, from India. Having run out of Chinese apps to ban, the party has now taken upon itself the formidable task of purifying the world of fruit. The party must march on undeterred, ridding other species of the purported Chinese signature. Why not rechristen the dragonfly next? Bengal, which is in the BJP’s political radar, could well figure in the scheme of things. Would Calcutta’s Chinatown be renamed Kamalnagar in the future?

The belief in the power of new names to obfuscate inconvenient historical facts or narratives is neither novel nor new: it is a shared political trait. In recent times, the BJP has gone about renaming Allahabad to Prayagraj and Mughalsarai Junction to Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction. In this, the BJP may have simply taken a leaf out of its political adversaries. The Congress changed Connaught Circus to Rajiv Chowk; among other renaming ceremonies that Bengal witnessed during the Left Front’s reign, Harrington Street in Calcutta, where the American embassy is situated, underwent a rather symbolic transformation into Ho Chi Minh Sarani. Yet, history is a resilient creature and the mere change of name is not enough to erase symbiotic connections that have been nourished over centuries. The dragon and the elephant, in spite of epochs of bitterness, share such bonds. Would New India agree to give up its beloved cup of chai, China’s most enduring gift to the world? Getting the Bengali to throw away a plate of chow mein could prove to be equally challenging for the BJP.

Instead of trying to rewrite history, there is a case for greater investment — both in terms of scholarship and diplomacy — in old connections that are the embodiment of shared histories. The BJP is desperately trying to prove that it is a disciple of Rabindranath Tagore. This great man had the vision to recognize the importance of fraternity that transcends political and geographical boundaries. Cheena Bhavana at Visva-Bharati is a testament to the need of maintaining the intercourse of culture and friendship especially during times of strife. The fraternity that is the outcome of such a syncretic vision could go a long way in keeping the dragon away from the door.",Going bananas over fruit,www.telegraphindia.com
140,141,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/people/the-art-of-giving/cid/1804574,"Whenever we are stuck in traffic in Bangalore and my husband complains, I remind him that he is responsible for it!” Sudha Murty quips sometime in the middle of a session for the Ladies Study Group (LSG) and a subsequent chat on January 13. Chairperson of Infosys Foundation for the last 25 years, Murty is a woman of many firsts. Incidentally, her meagre savings of Rs 10,000 that acted as seed money for husband Narayana Murthy to start Infosys Limited as she put her own career on hold also helped put India on the IT map of the world. A Padma Shri-recipient, she has aided relief work for 16 national disasters since setting up the foundation in 1996, has written over 30 books in English and Kannada that have been translated into more languages across India, and has set up over 60,000 libraries in the country, and this is just touching the tip of the formidable iceberg that is Murty’s repertoire. “While we have all watched movies, read books and comic strips on fictional female superheroes achieving the impossible, being in conversation with Sudha Murty has been a testimony to the fact that such women do exist and are there for us to emulate. This has truly been a landmark session for all and an absolute honour and privilege for me personally,” said Diya Jaiswal, president, LSG, who also moderated the session. Her books for children are often referred to as the “Panchatantra of modern times” but it is an anthology of shorts she wrote (Three Thousand Stitches — Ordinary People, Extraordinary Lives) that perhaps best summarises her own journey in social work, from getting hit by chappals to being nestled within the folds of trust by the devadasis, which has remained a personal favourite of mine. Warm and generous with her laughter, Murty in the middle of her chat with me takes time to ask if I have read the aforementioned book. Easy to giving, it is not difficult to understand why it is second nature to her to live the way she does. Here are some of the highlights of her story in her own words.

I can’t recollect the first time I gave something to someone but I can easily tell you that I was fortunate to be born in a family where my grandparents and parents were always giving. My father was a doctor who would not want to be unavailable over the phone even when he was eating as it could be a suffering patient at the other end trying to get in touch. I was born in a middle-class family for whom money wasn’t important but concern for people was. My grandfather taught me to give the best to people. Atithi was the most important and spending on ourselves was the least important. Those were the things that were taught to me as a child and that has been a big influence in my life. When I had given a gold ring as a 12-year-old to people collecting money for our soldiers fighting the China war in 1962, I had expected my mother to be very angry. But she said that I had done a good job because she was aware of the cost that the independence of our country came at. That encouraged me to do more in life and I have written about that in Amma, What’s Your Duty?, when my daughter asked me what my aim in life was when I was 45. That’s when I realised I wanted to do something for the society in a more formal way and formed the foundation. That started in 1996 and we are running into its 25th year now. I used to take my children to work and make them help me pack along with volunteers when we would help out during national disasters. When Rohan (her son, Rohan Murty) was very young, he came and told me how his friend in school treated him to a meal at a five-star for his birthday. But I never did that for my children when they were young. He wanted to celebrate his birthday the same way but I did not agree. My sister was a doctor at a government hospital and I took him there on his birthday instead. He was very upset but I asked him to give it a chance. Seeing so many suffering children there, he asked me why that was their predicament. I told him that the only difference between those children and him was that they were born on the other side and could not afford the basics. I asked him if we could save the money spent for his birthday to buy things for the children in the paediatric ward instead. For his birthday, I told him we would have samosas and Frooti to celebrate at home. I have always believed that money does not make us great but it is how useful we are to society. In 2001, on his 18th birthday while he was at Cornell University when I wished him, he wrote an email to me saying he was proud of me as unlike every mother who works for their child, ‘you work for others’ children and your children too’. I felt that was a gift to me on his birthday. In south India, going to Benares for pilgrimage was a dream. I went in 1995 and the rule is that when you go there, you must leave something there that is very dear to you. My husband would make fun saying that he would not go because then he would have to leave his dearest thing there, which was me. (Laughs) I used to love going to shop for saris for anyone as I saw a reflection of nature in the colours. So after taking a dip in the Ganges, I decided to abandon shopping for saris. I realised how impulsive it was a little later and sat on the steps there thinking about it. But I made up my mind as I asked myself why I was wearing new saris. Since then, I genuinely lost my zest for sari shopping. I go with people who insist but I really don’t like it anymore, and did not indulge in it even for my daughter and son’s weddings. Sometimes it is difficult to say no to people gifting me saris with love but I try to not take saris from anyone, including my relatives. I come from a small community that was very conservative. Nobody in our history has married anybody across the river Tungabhadra — men were very intelligent and women used to be great cooks in our family. I was the first to marry across the river and everyone was shocked. Scissors would not touch a woman’s hair in the family — only the man’s, except when you went to Allahabad for pilgrimage. And I had a bob cut because it was easier to maintain. My relatives were so upset and my house became the house of “the girl with the bob cut”! From there I went to engineering college, where I was the only girl in the entire batch. I was alone and it wasn’t easy, but I always believed that it’s all in the mind and that’s how I got through. I never wanted to work in India and had gotten a scholarship to a university in the US for my doctorate. But then I saw a notice in college about “young, bright engineers” being required at Telco (erstwhile Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company, now Tata Motors) Pune and Jamshedpur with a stipend of Rs 1,500, which was pretty good in 1974. There was a line at the bottom of the notice saying: “Women students need not apply”. I felt offended and wrote a postcard to J.R.D. Tata asking how someone like him and his company could not harness the capacity of womenfolk in India. And then came a letter for an interview for me, which I cleared and got an offer. I had decided not to join but then my father questioned my sitting for the interview in the first place if I did not want the job. “If you’re on the topic of equal rights for women then you’re opening a cupboard with many skeletons in it. You must take up this job to open the road for other women instead of being selfish and settling abroad,” my father told me. I took up the Telco job and the rest is history.

Murthy told me, “Look I am 5’4”, not good to look at, I come from a poor family. I cannot make you rich but I will give you happiness, contentment and we will read a lot of books together.” I told him, “I am not a great cook and I always like adventure.” So we told each other what we could and could not do and then decided to not spend any money on our wedding. We got married at home with Rs 800 paid equally by the two of us. Whenever we are stuck in traffic in Bangalore and my husband complains, I remind him that he is responsible for it! He started the software industry here and got more people, more cars and now the city is a concrete jungle. We did start Infosys but Murthy was a bigger dreamer than me. He always wanted software to be birthed in India because he believed that ethical hard work was enough to become rich in India without any malpractice. He believed that the creation of wealth lay in the creation of jobs. I gave my savings of Rs 10,000 to my husband for it. I always say that the secret to my happy marriage is that behind every successful woman is an understanding man. Murthy returned my support when I started the Infosys Foundation. I used to write since I was in school and I started writing more because of Infosys Foundation. My position helped me look at the lives of a variety of people from actors and politicians to the poor from close quarters and got so many stories to tell. It is difficult to pick a favourite book but as I write more, the writing gets better. Amongst the books written about animals, The Gopi Diaries (named after her pet dog, Gopi) series is one of the most satisfying in my life. Getting hit by chappals and rotten tomatoes When I started the Infosys Foundation, I did not know which problem I should have addressed first because in India, there are so many! I started with the devadasi project without knowing its depth and it was very hard. Initially, they did not accept me and threw chappals and rotten tomatoes at me. It took 18 years for them to accept me and then, with Abhay Kumar, we did a lot of good work. My father used to tell me that he would feel very proud of me if I could change the lives of 10 devadasis but I had only managed to change the lives of seven when he died. Since then, it is more than 3,000 now. When these 3,000 women left their old lives, got successfully rehabilitated and then started their own bank, they called me to thank me. I created the Mahila Vimochana Sangh for them so that they could ask for their own rights, pensions, housing, etc. As a gift, they made a quilt with 3,000 stitches, each put in by one of them to remember me. I went to Bangladesh and got them a better quality of quilt with great kantha work on it and told them to try to make it this way, which they did and I sold those on their behalf. The first building I remember seeing in my village with my grandfather was a library and I read all the books.

The industry body for stonefruit growers in New Zealand is reassuring international customers of our Covid-free status, after the virus was reportedly found on fruit packaging in China.

Chinese media organisation The Global Times reported that the virus was found on the inner packaging of imported cherries in the city of Wuxi near Shanghai.

It said it was not clear what country the fruit came from.

Summer Fruit chief executive Richard Palmer said the Ministry for Primary Industries had not been advised by Chinese authorities that the detection was in any way connected with New Zealand fruit.

""As New Zealand officials have not been advised of a Covid-19 detection, and with New Zealand free of Covid-19 in the community, Summerfruit New Zealand can only conclude that this apparent case is not related to New Zealand fruit.

""The last case of Covid-19 in the New Zealand community was on 18 November 2020, before the export summerfruit harvest started,"" Palmer said.

He said the summerfruit industry had rigorous food safety procedures in place, including the monitoring of staff health for Covid-19.

""With strict food safety and quality processes in place, and the country free of Covid-19, New Zealand fruit represents the safest possible source of fresh fruit, a reputation our industry strives to maintain.""","Covid 19 coronavirus: Virus found on fruit packaging in China, NZ growers reassure customers",www.nzherald.co.nz

143,144,https://www.997wtn.com/news/catholic-league-president-remembers-larry-king/,"Catholic League president Bill Donohue on Saturday issued a statement on the death of iconic talk show host Larry King, who’s passing was announced Saturday.

Larry King was perhaps the greatest interviewer of all time. Unlike today’s cable news hosts, Larry came to the table without cue cards. There were no canned questions prepared by a producer, no teleprompter to lean on for support. Most of all, Larry listened.

Larry asked a question and the guest answered. The next question was based on what the guest said. It was a conversation. He would listen attentively to what was said and would then dig deeper. And so on.

Sounds fairly simple. But it isn’t. Larry’s gift was to make his guests feel relaxed, getting them to open up about matters they would usually be reluctant to reveal. He was never confrontational. This explains why he could secure guests who would never go on with any other host.

The rap on Larry was that he was a “soft ball” interviewer. That is grossly unfair. It would be more accurate to say he didn’t insult his guests they way so many commentators do today. His job was to draw his guests out — not to put them in their place.

Beginning in the late 1980s, I had the pleasure of being his guest for many years. Indeed, it was those appearances, including interviews I did on “Crossfire” and the “Phil Donahue Show,” that eventually brought me to the attention of the Catholic League; clips of my segments were previewed by the search committee charged with selecting a new president and CEO in 1993.

Larry and I often spent time together after the show, and I got to know a man who did seem to have a bad bone in his body. He once told me that of all the great people in the world whom he would like to interview, his number-one choice would be the pope (meaning Pope John Paul II).

Larry King was one of a kind. May he rest in peace.",Catholic League President Remembers Larry King,www.997wtn.com
144,145,https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2021/01/black-man-arrested-for-collecting-signatures-says-deputys-firing-is-start-toward-change.html,"BATTLE CREEK, MI -- La’Ron Marshall believes the firing of the Calhoun County sheriff’s deputy who arrested him as he collected signatures is a “start toward change.”

Marshall, a Black resident of Springfield, said he hopes the decision will improve the relationship between police and residents, as well as spur better police policies and training.

“They’re moving in the right direction,” Marshall said Friday, Jan. 22, not long after Calhoun County sheriff’s administrators announced they were terminating the deputy who arrested him Jan. 2. “It’s a start toward change.”

The deputy’s name has been released.

Marshall was collecting signatures in his neighborhood to start a tenants’ association when he was approached by two deputies who said they had received a complaint about a person soliciting in the area. They asked to see his permit.

Marshall told them he was collecting signatures. After a verbal exchange, one of the deputies arrested him after he failed to provide an ID.

Prosecutors later dropped the charges. Marshall and his attorney contend the arrest was a case of racial profiling.

In a statement issued Friday, Calhoun County Sheriff Steven Hinkley and Undersheriff Timothy Hurtt said the deputy made the wrong decision.

“We hold ourselves to high standards of professionalism to the communities we protect. When we are right, we are right. When we are wrong, we admit we are wrong. On January 2, we were wrong,” according to the statement.

“I do think the sheriff handled the situation very well,” she said. “There are so many instances where police departments didn’t do the right thing.”

She said the deputy’s dismissal “sends a really important message to the community” and can help to repair a frayed relationship between police and community members who distrust them.

Related: Racial profiling needs to stop, says Black man arrested while collecting signatures

Marshall’s arrest was somewhat ironic, Lord said.

“The reason he was out there collecting signatures that night was to increase safety and security in the community,” she said.

One of Marshall’s goals with the tenants’ association is to help stop vehicle break-ins, vandalism and speeding in the area.

The interaction between Marshall and the deputies on Jan. 2 was captured on cell phone video by the neighbor he was visiting at the time. Marshall was with his two children, ages 13 and 8.

The video was posted to YouTube and gained considerable attention.

Marshall said he believed the deputy’s termination was appropriate and questions whether the second deputy, who allowed the arrest to proceed, should face repercussions.

“He just let it happen,” he said.

Calhoun County officials say a review surrounding the second deputy is still ongoing.

“The system is broken. The attitudes have to change,” he said.

145,146,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/protesters-in-mississauga-ont-demand-justice-after-siu-clears-officer-in-killing-of-jamal-francique-1.5279606,"TORONTO -- A group of protesters in Mississauga, Ont. is demanding justice for Jamal Francique after a report by the province’s police watchdog found no reasonable grounds to criminally charge the officer who shot and killed the 28-year-old man last year.

On Saturday, members of the Malton People’s Movement (MPM) took to two of the city’s busiest intersections to voice their grievance by hanging signs that read “Peel Police Are Murderers” and “#Justice4Jamal.”

“There is no moving forward without accountability,” a protester named Asher told CTV News Toronto. “It’s angering to constantly see all these cases that have no results or no justice for families or the people who experience trauma from these incidents with police.”

The demonstration comes days after Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) cleared the Peel police officer who shot Francique on Jan. 7, 2020.

According to the report by the SIU, police had been investigating Francique for allegedly dealing drugs and possessing a firearm. Peel police officers had observed Francique ""travelling to various locations in breach of his bail conditions"" and decided to arrest him for allegedly violating the terms of his bail, the report said.

READ MORE: Ontario's police watchdog clears Peel cop who shot and killed Jamal Francique in Mississauga last year

At that time, the SIU said several plainclothes officers in unmarked vehicles attended Francique’s home in Mississauga and waited for him to get into his car.

When Francique got into his vehicle at approximately 5:45 p.m., the SIU said he began to drive away. Officers then attempted to box the car in while others got out of their vehicles with their guns drawn and pointed at Francique.

Francique accelerated toward a grassy area, the SIU said, and struck one car while one officer jumped out of the way. At that point, another officer on foot fired his gun four times as Francique drove towards him, the SIU said.

The car came to a halt 30 metres away after it hit a home.

Officers on scene said they were afraid that Francique had a gun -- which was later found in his satchel -- and did not approach his vehicle, the SIU said, waiting for the arrival of Peel Regional Police tactical officers instead.

At approximately 8:05 p.m. the SIU said tactical officers found Francique in the driver's seat in ""obvious and acute medical distress,"" suffering from a gunshot wound to the left side of his head.

Francique was rushed to St. Michael's Hospital for treatment where he remained on life support for three days before he was pronounced dead on Jan. 10.

Joseph Martino, the director of the Special Investigations Unit, said that the subject officer told investigators that he feared for his life when Francique drove at him during the arrest.

However, he admitted there were aspects of the officer's conduct that raised questions.

""One may question, for example, the wisdom of the (subject officer) placing himself in the vicinity of a vehicle whose driver was evidently attempting to flee from police,"" Martino wrote.

The MPM says it has its own issues with the report, including allegations that Peel police misinformed the SIU about the time they arrived in the area and when exactly the shooting occurred.

The group says its “Peel-wide poster and banner drop campaign” is part of a series of several actions organized to protest the killing of Francique, as well as the deaths of D’Andre Campbell and Ejaz Choudry, who also died following interactions with Peel police in 2020.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Peel Regional Police Chief Nishan Duraiappah said, “Any time a life is lost due to an interaction with police, it is a tragedy that all involved wish could have been averted.”

“Family and loved ones are left behind with questions and the officers involved are forced to deal with the realities of the stress these outcomes cause.”

Police were called to First Works Baptist Church in El Monte around 1 a.m. where they found the walls of the church vandalized and smoke coming out of the church’s window, which appeared to be smashed in.

“We realized that the windows were not smashed, that they had actually blown out from some type of explosion,” said El Monte Police Department Lt. Christopher Cano.

The FBI’s Los Angeles field office said agents responded along with El Monte police and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department to what it called an “IED attack” at the church. IED is an acronym for improvised explosive device.

“Bomb Technicians and an Evidence Response Team are processing the scene which sustained damage. No injuries are reported,” the field office said in a statement.

The field office said a joint investigation is underway and anyone with information on the incident should contact the Los Angeles field office.

Police did not provide any further details and church representatives were not readily available for comment.

The church had been the center of some local protests due to its condemnation of same-sex relationships, according to CNN affiliate KCAL.

The church is described as an “independent, fundamental” Baptist church on its website, which includes a doctrinal statement listing the church’s beliefs. One of the beliefs listed is: “We believe that homosexuality is a sin and an abomination which God punishes with the death penalty.”

A protest scheduled for Sunday by a group called Keep El Monte Friendly has been canceled, according to the group’s Facebook page.

More than 20 people were injured and several homes destroyed by a large explosion Saturday in a residential area of the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials said.

The source of the accidental explosion was apparently the home of a member of one of Gaza's armed groups.

""An explosion occurred in a house in Beit Hanoun this morning, resulting in a number of injuries,"" the interior ministry said, adding that an investigation had been launched into the cause of the blast.

Medical sources said more than 20 people were injured, two of them seriously.

Witnesses said several homes were damaged as a result of the explosion in the home of an ""activist"". Police cordoned off the area.

There was no immediate official explanation of the explosion, but the Israeli military said it was the result of militants ""storing weapons in residential homes"".

Houses ""have been turned into warehouses for weapons... and missiles for terrorist organisations, and those who pay the price in the end are innocent civilians,"" the military's Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee, said.

After a wait of nearly three months, Nakul BK finally received the body of his younger brother on Saturday. Nakul along with his widowed-sister-in-law took the body back to their hometown for cremation.

""It was the time of Tihar (festival of lights) when I last spoke to him over the phone. I talked with him as he was talking with the sisters at that time, he had promised to call and talk to us again but it never happened. We got the news about his death later and we are here to claim his body,"" Nakul said.

Besides Nakul's younger brother, bodies of as many as 19 migrant workers who lost their lives in incidents and in various other causes were flown back to Nepal on Saturday through a Nepal Airlines flight from Kuala Lumpur. The airlines said that it brought in the bodies of Nepali migrant workers as a part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).

""As per the Nepali Embassy in Malaysia, there are 37 more bodies of Nepali workers who lost their lives in due course of work. We are making further preparations to bring those bodies back to Nepal. It is part of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR),"" Deputy Spokesperson for the national flag carrier Sulekh Mishra told ANI over the phone.

In an effort to bring the bodies back home, Nepal Airlines had sent its A-330 Aircraft which got stuck in Malaysia for a long time due to the pandemic and other official procedural issues.

As per government figures, there are about 3.82 lakh Nepali workers working legally in Malaysia. Aside from this, the number of illegal workers who went with a tourist visa and worked there without a proper permit also stands high.

Out of those documented in Malaysia, about 75 per cent are employed in the manufacturing sector followed by 21 per cent in service sectors. An estimated one million undocumented migrant workers were said to be working in Malaysia in the first half of 2020, who were later asked to mend their ways.

Some of them got through the process and have continued to work legally in Malaysia while a few lost their lives before getting through it. One of those who died before receiving the status of the documented worker is the father of Milan Magar, who came all the way from Dhankuta to receive the body of the 41-year-old.

""He was working in Malaysia for 10 years. He passed away during his sleep, he returned back from duty and slept, after which he didn't wake up,"" Milan Magar, who came with his relative to the airport to take back body, told ANI.

Milan said that his father lost his life on December 12 last year, but the family had to wait for nearly a month to receive the body of the deceased.

""It was held on for one-and-a-half months. My father was working there defying the laws, which caused a delay in the completion of procedures, it might have been the reason for the delay in flying back the body. After getting the clearance we are here to receive the body,"" Milan added.

Enlisted as a least developed country by the United Nations, Nepal, with a population of about 30 million recorded an unemployment rate of 1.47 per cent in December 2020 by the World Bank.

As per the data of the World Bank, Nepal's unemployment rate earlier in 2019 stood at 1.41 per cent and has averaged 1.56 per cent from December 1991 to 2020.

Now laden with the responsibility to look after the family for being the son of the family- the result of the so-called patriarchal mindset, Milan plans to work in Nepal itself and work here but states that it mainly depends on time.

With members of the City Council Public Safety Committee describing residents in neighborhoods across Chicago as fearful of being carjacked while running daylight errands, Police Department brass pledged to crack down on the ongoing spree. Chief of Detectives Brendan Deenihan said some of the cars being stolen, often at gunpoint, are being used in other crimes, or cut up or resold by criminal gangs. But in many cases, teenagers are taking the vehicles to drive around in them for a while, then abandon them. “Overall, the biggest spike we see right now is people taking cars, driving around for eight or 10 hours, then dumping the car,” Deenihan said. The increase in carjackings has been seen not just in Chicago, but the suburbs and nationwide, he said. “It’s everywhere,” Deenihan said. Often the robbers are minors, and aldermen called for prosecutors to crack down on those offenders so young people think there are significant consequences rather than just a slap on the wrist for carjackings.","Spike in Chicago carjackings mostly due to joyriding young people, police say",thesouthern.com

Garret Miller, who is from the Dallas suburb of Richardson, was arrested on Friday after being named in a five-count federal complaint.

Authorities allege that Miller posted photos and videos on his social media accounts that show him inside the Capitol during the January 6 storming of the building by supporters of then-president Donald Trump.

It is also alleged that he called for violence in online posts, including a tweet that simply read: “Assassinate AOC,” a reference to Ms Ocasio-Cortez.

In another tweet, Miller posted: “They are right next time we bring the guns,” an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit.

Miller also threatened a US Capitol police officer during an exchange on Instagram, writing that he planned to “hug his neck with a nice rope”, the affidavit states.

After posting a photo on Facebook showing him inside the Capitol, Miller responded to a comment on the picture with: “just want to incriminate myself a little lol,” according to an FBI affidavit.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez posted Miller’s charging documents on Twitter on Friday and then tweeted: “On one hand you have to laugh, and on the other know that the reason they were this brazen is because they thought they were going to succeed.”

Miller’s lawyer, Clint Broden, said his client regrets the actions he took “in a misguided effort to show his support for former President Trump.

“His social media comments reflect very ill-considered political hyperbole in very divided times and will certainly not be repeated in the future,” Mr Broden said.

“He looks forward to putting all of this behind him.

“We are hopeful that, given his family support and regret for his actions, he will be released so that he can resolve the charges against him in a timely fashion.”

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have begun to piece together the events of that day, while attempting to thwart any impending attacks. Scores of people have been arrested and charged over the attack - the vast majority being men.

In the wake of these events, there were stories attributing the violence and destruction to ""white male rage"" ""violent male rage"" and ""angry white men.""

But what about the women?

To distill the violent insurrection into a tale of angry male rage is to overlook the threat that women in the mob posed to congressional officials, law enforcement and U.S. democracy that day.

Several women have been identified as alleged participants in the events of Jan. 6. Among those women are a former school occupational therapist, an employee of a county sheriff's office, a real estate broker and a former mayoral candidate.

At least one woman is being investigated for her role in organizing the attack with fellow members of the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia movement. And Ashli Babbit, a female veteran, was shot dead by police while attempting to breach the Senate floor.

The women who took part in the siege of the Capitol are part of a long history of women's participation in extremist violence, both in the United States and abroad.

Women have buoyed American far-right organizations and causes for centuries. In her recent book on women at the forefront of contemporary white nationalism, author Seyward Darby writes that women are not ""incidental to white nationalism, they are a sustaining feature.""

Since the late 1800s, women have supported and enabled the terrorist white supremacist organization the Ku Klux Klan, while hundreds of thousands joined its female affiliate, Women of the Ku Klux Klan, and its predecessors.

Women helped establish the Klan's culture, bolstered its recruitment efforts and manufactured its propaganda. Despite its hyper-masculine ideology, which identifies white men as the primary arbiters of political power, women have also held leadership positions within the modern-day Klan.

More recently, women have joined the far-right Proud Boys movement, which has openly recruited female foot soldiers. In December, a growing rift between male and female Proud Boys was reported. After experiencing intense sexist backlash from men in the organization, women led by MMA fighter Tara LaRosa began their own group, the Proud Girls USA.

To leave one extremist organization in order to form another suggests a deep commitment to the far-right cause.

A 2005 study noted a disconnect between the rise in women within American right-wing terrorist organizations and the attention it received from law enforcement.

Despite a marked increase in women's engagement in acts of terror against the state and racial minorities, security officials have largely failed to publicize, search and interrogate women operatives in these organizations, even after they become known to law enforcement.

There is also evidence that American far-right women have drawn inspiration and tactical knowledge from women engaged in extremist violence abroad.

Evidence from the global war on terror points to the potential dangers of ignoring the growth of violent extremism among women. In Iraq, for example, female terrorists carried out large numbers of deadly suicide attacks against American assets during the U.S. occupation.

The rest of the world has since been forced to grapple with the reality of violent women after female terrorists staged lethal attacks in Nigeria, Somalia, Tunisia, the Philippines, Indonesia and France.

Recent terror attacks in American cities such as San Bernardino, California, and Las Vegas that featured women among the perpetrators confirm violent women have already inflicted damage on U.S. soil.

In fact, my research suggests that attacks by female terrorists are often more destructive than those executed by their male counterparts.

In an analysis of over 2,500 global suicide attacks, I show disparities in the severity of male and female attacks are greatest where gender stereotypes suggest that women are neither violent nor political. Such tropes can blind security officials and civilians to the threat posed by women terrorists, causing them to overlook the potential for female complicity.

Female terrorists, including in Iraq, Israel and Nigeria, have been able to deflect suspicion because they were women. My research shows that gender bias can become deadly when it stops effective counterterrorism policies, such as surveillance, searches and interrogations, from being implemented.

Additionally, since ordinary citizens played an unusual role in exposing the identities of the Capitol attackers, gender biases among civilians are also relevant. Failure to accept women's complicity in the Capitol siege and the broader movement may prevent the identification of female offenders and impedes efforts to punish and deter future attacks.

American women have been key pillars of support for violent right-wing extremists for centuries. They have been right-wing extremists themselves - racist skinheads, neo-Nazis and Klanswomen. Women are also Oath Keepers, Three Percenters and Proud Boys. They were capitol rioters.

To construct an accurate account of the Capitol attack, it's necessary to ask ""Where are the women?"" And the answer is, ""Right there.""",Capitol mob wasn&#039;t just angry men - there were angry women as well,www.middleeaststar.com

Saugeen Shores police were called to Cemetery Road just before 5 p.m. Friday after a citizen reported a suspected impaired driver in a truck in a ditch.

The male driver was still seated in the truck when officers arrived and then attempted to drive out of the deep snow while ignoring an officer’s demands to stop, Saugeen Shores Police Service Sgt. Andy Evans said in a police statement.

“Officers were able to speak with the male who was observed to be clearly intoxicated by alcohol and convinced him to stop trying to flee. The male eventually exited the vehicle under his own power,” Evans said.

After arresting the man, he immediately began resisting and threatened to harm one of the officers. He kicked the officer during the arrest, causing a minor injury.

After he was in the police cruiser, he threatened to kill another officer.

The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will increase the storage capacity in Mukundapur booster pumping station by more than double, reducing the dependency on underground water pulled up through deep tube wells for supply to residents.

The work to build the additional capacity will begin from next week, said a senior engineer of the civic body.

The current storage capacity of the reservoir at Mukundapur station is 0.5 million gallon. Two more reservoirs — one semi-underground and one elevated — with a combined storage capacity of 0.75 million gallon would be built, said the engineer of CMC’s water supply department.

“The deadline to commission the two reservoirs is 18 months,” said the engineer.

Several residents of ward 109 — including areas like Mukundapur, Nayabad New Garia and Panchasayar —would benefit once the storage capacity is doubled.

The residents now receive a mix of water supplied from the Dhapa water treatment plant and water pumped up from underground through deep tube well.

A resident of Nayabad’s 1B bus stand neighbourhood said the water they receive from the CMC’s network was turbid. “If we do not clean the reservoir once in two months at least, a lot of dirt flows through the tap,” said the resident, who is a state government employee.

Asis Majumdar, the director of School of Water Resources at Jadavpur University, told Metro that underground water could have arsenic and fluoride as contaminants.

“The underground water in Calcutta’s eastern fringes has very high amount of to-

the taste of the water very salty...,” Majumdar said.

The existing station at Mukundapur was commissioned in 2013. Treated water from the Dhapa water treatment plant is stored in the reservoir of the station. It is then pushed into the distribution with added force by the pumping station.

The CMC engineer said that the existing storage capacity in the booster pumping station was commissioned with the hope that treated water would reach all households in the area.

A Nayabad resident said that they received good quality water in the initial days after inauguration of the booster pumping station, but within a year and half the pressure reduced.

“This happened because the population growth in the area exceeded expectation and the storage capacity at the Mukundapur booster pumping station was not enough to supply the demand of the increasing population,” said the CMC engineer.",CMC to double storage capacity in Mukundapur reservoir,www.telegraphindia.com
165,166,https://www.smdp.com/cities-consider-right-to-return-for-historically-displaced-residents/201204,"Like many cities across the country, the City of Santa Monica is attempting to right the wrongs of the past and it’s looking for local residents to help determine how by completing an online survey.

City leaders are calling on the community to give their input about the possibility of adding a new “Right to Return” criteria to the city’s Below Market Housing program, which is a local initiative that provides Santa Monica residents and workers with apartments in the private sector at a rent that is lower than market rate.

“There are about six questions on the survey but the key question that’s driving this policy is the first question, and that question is how do you think historically displaced residents, their parents, legal guardians, or grandparents should be prioritized in the current setup,” said Natasha Guest Kingscote, a Human Services Administrator who is overseeing the survey efforts.

If approved by council in the future, Kingscote added, a new Right to Return criteria would give prioritization to former Santa Monica residents who were displaced from the Bel Mar and 10 Freeway-Pico Corridor areas in the 1950s and 1960s.

From the 1880s to post-World War II, many African Americans came from southern states to Santa Monica in an effort to escape Jim Crow-era racial restrictions. Lured by advertisements promoting the benefits of Southern California: employment, good climate, health, beautiful landscapes and a more liberated lifestyle, some migrated west and found themselves in the Westside, specifically Santa Monica’s Belmar Triangle.

The area is believed to have been the oldest African-American settlement of any seaside community in the region, according to local historians, and it was a haven of fun since the heart of the community was just blocks away from the Bay Street Beach, which is where Black people could enjoy the sand and sun with minimal racial harassment.

“The African-American neighborhood thrived in the Belmar Triangle until the 1950s when it literally went up in smoke in the name of urban renewal,” the Santa Monica Conversancy’s website states, adding: “The land was taken away by eminent domain to make way for the City’s new Civic Center and auditorium. The City burned down this once vibrant community of black-owned businesses and homes, many of them shotgun houses.”

In the decades since, Santa Monica and surrounding Westside communities have grappled with racial inequities. Recently, Santa Monica City Council passed a Black Agenda that includes a number of recommendations related to racial justice, but Kingscote said the right to return efforts began back in 2017.

Since 2017, the City of Santa Monica has been a member of the Government Alliance on Race and Equity, a national network of government entities working to achieve racial equity and advance opportunities for all. Last year, City Council considered a staff report that included the Government Alliance on Race and Equity’s Operational Plan.

“That was part of how the first flag was placed in the sand. Council said it was something to consider, so we have since picked up this community input process that we’re in the middle of now to get feedback and to see what residents would like us to do,” said Kingscote, who noted the city’s current BHM priorities are listed online with the survey information at https://www.santamonica.gov/righttoreturn so residents can see where other BHM applicants would fall in the prioritization efforts.

The Community Input Period is expected to remain open until Feb. 6 and a presentation to City Council is expected to occur Feb. 23.",Cities consider 'Right to Return' for historically displaced residents,www.smdp.com
166,167,https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/news/national/19034532.scientist-advising-government-urges-tougher-lockdown/,"A scientist advising the Government on coronavirus has called for tighter lockdown restrictions, describing the current rules as “the problem” amid rising infections and deaths.

Professor Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at UCL, said an “overwhelming” number of people were sticking to lockdown rules as she questioned how Government messaging was being targeted at the public.

It comes after the Government launched a new advert that asks people to “look in the eyes” of frontline medical workers and Covid-19 patients and tells them to stay at home.

“The advert, the Government messages and Priti Patel talking about fines is all on the basis that the main problem is that people aren’t adhering to the rules that exist,” Prof Michie told Times Radio.

“But actually all the data show that the overwhelming number of people are sticking to the rules with one exception which is self-isolation.

“In fact I would say that it’s not so much people not sticking to the rules, but it’s the rules themselves that are the problem.”

Prof Michie, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), said current lockdown rules were not enough to tackle the more infectious variant of Covid-19, which Boris Johnson revealed may be associated with “a higher degree of mortality”.

She said there were twice as many people going to work and using public transport compared to the first lockdown, and more children in classrooms because the Government “has widened the definition of who’s a key worker”.

She advocated for a much stricter lockdown, and possibly even moreso than the first lockdown in March last year.

Prof Michie described nurseries and places of worship, which are both allowed to remain open during lockdown, as “superspreading events”, and said she had heard from a lot of people who are “really distraught” about going to work.

On what restrictions she would like to see, Prof Michie said: “Do what we did in March but consider are there other things we could tighten?

“The better the lockdown is now the shorter it will be.

“I think we should throw everything we can at really driving transmission down to a low level.

“Make a really effective test, trace and isolate system so when inevitable outbreaks occur there’s a system there that can manage it and prevent it getting out of control again.”

A further 1,401 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Friday, the Government announced, while a further 40,261 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus were recorded in the UK, bringing the total number to 3,583,907.",Scientist advising Government urges tougher lockdown,www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk

In Los Angeles County, health officials have warned that without more vaccine shipments, the county won't be fully vaccinated until next year.

As of Saturday night, vaccination sites across the country have closed doors and canceled appointments as frustration mounts over supply problems.

The vaccine crisis comes as scientists worry that a new, more infectious, U.K. strain could become dominant in the United States.

This week, Jeff Wilson's Pittsburgh drug store administered its last dose, not knowing when the state would deliver more. He said, ""I asked for 1,000 doses and they couldn't give me any kind of answer.""

In Texas, receiving doses is like playing the lottery.

""Unfortunately we don't have enough to give to every provider in the state, every week. And so we do have to pick and choose,"" said Chris Von Deusen with the Texas Department of Health Services.

New York's stockpile has run dry, and in Florida, where there were no rules to keep temporary snowbirds from getting shots, the governor has told non-residents to go elsewhere.

Florida governor Ron DeSantis said they aren't getting enough vaccine. ""We have places that can do more and we want them to do more and we want them to do more,"" DeSantis said.

Vaccine super sites, like the one at Charlotte Motor Speedway, have helped drive efforts to distribute the vaccine. The need is urgent: Other highly contagious strains have now been detected, and healthcare workers worry about receiving their second dose.

Nikkema Taylor, a healthcare worker, said is she feeling ""so much frustration and so much anxiety, but I trusted the officials. I was like, OK, I am a healthcare worker. I have been going to work every day. COVID is going crazy, but applying for the second vaccine has been crazy.""

168,169,https://hamodia.com/2021/01/23/biden-tells-mexican-president-u-s-reverse-trumps-immigration-policies/,"The United States plans to reverse the Trump administration’s “draconian” immigration approach while working on policies addressing the causes of migration, President Joe Biden told his Mexican counterpart, the White House said on Saturday.

In a Friday call with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Biden outlined his plan to create new legal pathways for immigration and improve the process for people requesting asylum, according to an account of the call released by the White House.

Priorities include “reversing the previous administration’s draconian immigration policies,” the White House said.

The two leaders agreed to work together towards reducing “irregular migration,” the White House release said.

Mexico has a major role to play in Biden’s plans for immigration reform. Earlier this month, Mexico helped coordinate efforts in Central America to contain a large caravan of migrants heading for the United States.

Mexico’s Foreign Ministry also said it had begun talks with Washington about a COVID-19-related order signed by Biden to establish firmer health protocols for people entering U.S. territory.

The call was “pleasant and respectful,” López Obrador said in a brief post.

“Everything indicates relations will be good and for the benefit of our people and nations,” López Obrador said.

Nevertheless, Biden’s inauguration comes at a time of simmering tension over a now-dropped U.S. investigation into former Mexican Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos.

Cracking down on both legal and illegal immigration was a core focus of Biden‘s predecessor, Donald Trump.

Biden, meanwhile, has made an early push for a bill that would open a path for citizenship for the roughly 11 million people living in the United States illegally, though even his allies in Congress acknowledge that may be “a Herculean task.”",Biden Tells Mexican President U.S. to Reverse Trump's Immigration Policies | .com,hamodia.com

Depending on the outlet, the goal is too ambitious, or too modest, or doable but difficult, or already stirring disagreements within Biden’s pandemic response team. Only one thing is indisputable: Time will tell. April 30 will mark 100 days since Biden was inaugurated, but well before that, it should be clear whether the new administration is on track to fix the chaotic, lagging vaccination rollout it inherited. Even if that 100-day goal is achieved, it will be only the beginning. Experts estimate that 60% to 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated to extinguish the spread of the coronavirus. Anthony Fauci, who is being retained by Biden as the government’s top infectious-disease adviser, recently raised his estimate to 80% to 90%. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 death toll is 410,000 and counting. The situation is changing by the hour, but here is an overview: Q. Is the goal of 100 million doses in 100 days achievable? A. Yes, judging from the quickening pace of inoculations, and existing and expected deliveries by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, makers of the two authorized vaccines, both of which require two shots. In the 40 days since COVID-19 immunization began, 17.5 million doses have gone into arms — fewer than half of the 37.9 million doses delivered to the states, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

However, some states have ramped up enough to accelerate the overall effort. The number of people receiving a first dose has been approaching 1 million per day in recent weeks, and hit that target five times in the last 10 days, the Washington Post’s vaccination tracker shows. Meanwhile, Pfizer and Moderna together have pledged to deliver 200 million does by the end of March — more than 18 million doses a week, the New York Times reported Thursday. That would be enough to exceed Biden’s goal. Other COVID-19 vaccines that are close to seeking federal emergency authorization, notably Johnson & Johnson’s candidate, would further expand supply. Q. Why are some states doing better than others at giving the shots? A. The Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed played a vital role in getting vaccines from drawing board to distribution within a year, an unprecedented record. But the states and big cities were left to sweat the details of vaccinating a potential pool of 209 million adults, including prioritization criteria, notification systems, the creation and staffing of vaccination sites, and data reporting. The massive effort got even messier on Jan. 12, eight days before Biden was sworn in. Trump’s health secretary, Alex Azar, and CDC director, Robert Redfield, upended the phased priority system that CDC scientists and the states had spent months developing. Instead of expanding vaccination from frontline health workers and nursing homes to essential workers and those age 75 and up, Azar told the states to push to the front of the line a vast group of people he wanted to be there from the start — people age 65 and over — as well as younger people with chronic health conditions.

Some states — West Virginia, Vermont, Connecticut and the Dakotas — have done pretty well managing the resulting public confusion and frustration over who should get shots and how to do so. So far, these states have given at least one vaccine dose to more than 6% of their populations, according to the Washington Post tracker. The lack of federal organization and direction has left some states running low on doses, while others still have much of their supply sitting on shelves. It has also led to infighting. For example, the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school announced it would vaccinate academic employees and students who don’t have contact with patients in the second phase of vaccination — a move that Philadelphia says circumvents the city’s prioritization plans. Q. What is the Biden administration doing to improve this situation? A. Biden’s 198-page pandemic plan, unveiled Thursday, instructs federal agencies to harness the U.S. industrial base by invoking the Defense Production Act if needed to expand the vaccination efforts. Biden’s team is using the DPA to mass-produce a special syringe that can get six doses instead of five from each Pfizer vial, White House chief of staff Ron Klain told MSNBC. Biden is also enlisting the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide the kind of centralized coordination that has been missing. FEMA is supposed to work with the National Guard, states and localities to support existing community vaccination centers, or set up new ones, including equipping and staffing the sites.

Because vaccination will take time, Biden’s plan also bolsters existing COVID-19 testing and infection prevention measures. For example, masks will be required on public transportation, while a “pandemic testing board” will be created to expand access to testing, and make sure hot spots have ample capacity. Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion “American rescue plan” includes $160 billion to create national vaccination and testing programs. The $900 billion COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in December also includes funds to accelerate vaccine distribution. Q. What do experts think about Biden’s vaccination plans? A. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and diagnostic testing expert at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health, said that conceptually, setting up mass federally supported vaccination sites should improve efficiency. “I do think that will likely be a benefit vs. asking everyone to reinvent the wheel,” he said Friday. Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, told Kaiser Health News that Biden has introduced two things that are key to improving vaccine distribution: a strong vision and clear communication. She said the goal of 100 million shots in 100 days is “attainable,” but “extremely challenging.” That was echoed by Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher and a member of Biden’s COVID-19 task force, who called the goal “aspirational but doable.”","Q&A: Can Biden pull off 100 million COVID-19 vaccinations in 100 days?

342 students whose families income have been affected by COVID-19 in Nacula in the Yasawa Group have been assisted with school supplies by the Turtle Island Resort.

The supplies are worth $10,000 and a pack includes exercise books, notebooks, pens, pencils, rubbers, sharpeners, glue sticks, binders and rulers.

Her three older siblings sat beside her, each with their own woodburning tool in hand.

The Kellers spent their Saturday morning crafting Native American game pieces as part of the Mansfield Art Center’s Free Art Saturday program, a monthly class designed to provide accessible opportunities for children and families.

“With everything that’s going on in the world, it’s an opportunity to get out of the house and try something new. Take them out of their comfort zone,” said the children’s father, Ben. “This is definitely not your typical art project.”

Free Art Saturdays are held at the art center the fourth Saturday of the month, January thru November. Before the pandemic, there were up to 30 slots available; now classes are limited to 10 to allow for social distancing.

Program Director Deb Weaver said the goal of the program is to make art education accessible to all families.

“Free Art Saturday is a program that we offer families so that they stay connected to Mansfield Art Center, but it's also to give families an opportunity to do something with fine art that does not have financial burden behind it,” she explained.

Each Free Art Saturday has a different craft, so families can access different types of media throughout the year. Community sponsors typically cover the cost of materials and instruction.

“It allows us the ability to make the programming very rich because of not having the monetary restraints,” Weaver said.

January’s program gave kids the chance to make their own Stave stick game set. Each child got a set of flat craft sticks and to engrave with nature-inspired designs.

“Stave” describes a collection of games played by Native Americans as early as the 16th century. The stick game was a game of chance requiring six sticks, often from an elderberry or willow tree. After carving designs into one side of each stick, players would take turns tossing them into the air. Points were scored based on the number of sticks that fell with the designs facing upward.

Before demonstrating the craft and how to safely use the pyrography pen, Weaver explained that centuries ago, Native Americans used natural elements like wood, berries and plants to make art.

“Native Americans 500 years ago didn't have things like paint brushes, they didn't have people making black and blue and red and yellow paint,” she told the students. “They were using things from the environment and creating beautiful artworks.”

Weaver tries to incorporate science, math and history concepts into the art programming whenever possible. She showed the class how Native Americans would pound a fibrous yucca leaf with a rock to create a bristly paint brush and explained how the leaf’s chlorophyll helped bond berry ink to a surface, creating an image that would last hundreds of years.

Holly Frankhouse of Galion said the project was perfect for her daughter, Lily, who is learning about Sacagawea in school.

“Now she can picture her playing this game,” Holly said.

While art can build bridges to understanding many different cultures and ideas, Saturday’s class held a personal significance for Weaver.

“Both my grandparents were actually taken from their parents and given to White families,” she said. “That added to a great deal of how the Native American culture got washed out. Families like my family did not end up learning about (their culture).”

In addition to leading the project, Weaver also showed the students Native American artifacts that had been donated to the center.

“I like to integrate as much culture as I possibly can,” she said. “I am looking for deeper meaning than just the art itself -- helping them to learn something about past culture and how it relates to today and how things have changed.”",Kids dive into art & culture with Free Art Saturdays at Mansfield Art Center,www.richlandsource.com

“Service is a volunteer effort, accepted by only a few in the community. It is a tough job with no salary,” reads a statement on the Texas Association of School Boards website. “It is a critically important job that requires an election and then mandated training. It is a responsibility that takes time, a mature outlook and careful decision-making.”

The decisions school boards make affects not just a single child or school campus, but entire school districts.

“In communities across the state, dedicated school board members willingly step forward to tackel serious issues, like addressing the needs of school communities during a pandemic, and deal with financial uncertainties while receiving no pay in order to provide excellent education experiences for all children,” said James B. Crow, TASB executive director. “We urge communities to join us in applauding their service.”

Seven trustees make up the Alto ISD school board.

Jeffrey Duplichain serves as president, Jed Morris as vice president and Stancy Skinner as secretary. The remaining board members include Jermey Jackson, Jay Jones, Randy Low and Lionel Whitaker.

“The month of January is set aside to thank this group for their service to our school and community. Alto ISD is extremely blessed by the commitment of this team,” Superintendent Kelly West said. “We can say with total confidence that our board is STUDENT-FIRST board. They are diligent with overseeing our finances, giving when it comes to creating benefits for our employees and 100% supportive of any action item that is for th betterment of our students. We are truly blessed by the served of these seven men.”

Seven members also comprise the Bullard ISD school board.

Cory Zahirniak, elected in 2019, serves as board president. His term ends in 2022.

“There is no better way to give back to your community than to volunteer and serve your school district,” Zahirniak said. “To ensure the success of our youth is to ensure the success of our country.”

Brian Vestal serves as vice president. Having been elected in 2020, his term will not end until 2023.

Board member Cory Santos, also elected last year, will serve until 2023.

Stephanie Luper’s seat in Place 6 will be on the election ballot this year. She has served the board since 2013 and is currently its secretary.

Jason Stainback, elected in 2020, will serve as trustee until 2023.

Susie Saxion was elected in 2019 and her term ends next year.

Jason Campbell, elected in 2018, will face reelection this year if he chooses to continue serving.

“To serve as trustee is both an honor and privilege for the Bullard ISD and community in itself. As Christians, we are all charged by God to spread the Gospel (the Good News). Carrying that forward into anything we serve in, we are to do it wholeheartedly all to His honor,” Campbell said. “So as

school board members trying to always serve in that capacity, we each are to lift up and encourage everyone in the schools - students, faculty, administration – and the district we all live in. In Bullard, Christian values are a high priority which in turn, results in everyone striving to do their best. These values exist within our Board and help and direct us in the decisions we are to make, always with what is best for the students of BISD first. When you have a school and community’s support and cohesiveness with all the working parts of what it takes to efficiently run a school district, it all comes together and make it all a joy to serve. It becomes, and is a FAMILY. And serving your family glorifies God.”

New Summerfield ISD has a board consisting of six members.

Michael Davis holds the position of president. He was re-elected this year and has served as trustee for 30 years.

J.B. Neeley, secretary, was also recently re-elected and has served the board for seven years.

Loleta Davis, whose seat is up for election in May, has been on the board for 15 years.

Lori Lawson has been a NSISD trustee for eight years. Her current term expires in 2022.

Joe Taylor has served as a trustee for five year. His term also expires in 2022.

Gary Don Davis, having served the board for two years, has a term expiring in 2022.

“It has been a great experience my first year working with our board of trustees,” Superintendent Joe Brannen said. “It has been a difficult year for everyone and our school board has done everything possible to help our district. The time they put towards doing what is best for students and our staff is very much appreciated.”

The Troup ISD school board is comprised of seven members.

Shane Jasper, first elected in 2014, serves as board president. His term ends in 2023.

Gene Whitsell serves as vice president, with a term ending this year. He has been a board member since 2012.

Lisa Lewis, board secretary, was originally elected to the board in 2016. Her current term ends next year.

Dianne Hamilton became a board member in 2019 by appointment in Place 4. She was elected to Place 2 in 2020. Her term ends in 2023.

Fielding Winchester was added to the board in 2020 to fulfill an unexpired term, one that ends this year.

Clayton Vickers was originally elected to the board in 2016 and his current term of office ends next year.

Trustee Joe Morris joined the board in 2018. His current term ends in 2023.

“I serve on the Board because I believe our youth is the foundation upon which the future of this country will be built,” Morris said. “We must equip them with the best education possible to insure that future.”",Navigating to Success: continuing recognition of school board trustees,www.jacksonvilleprogress.com

According to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Garret Miller posted a video from the Capitol on his Twitter page, captioned “From inside congress.” He also allegedly made several other social media posts indicating his involvement leading up to and following the riot.

""I am about to drive across the country for this trump s---,"" Miller wrote in a Jan. 2 post, according to the complaint. ""Some crazy s--- going to happen this week. Dollar might collapse ... civil war could start ... not sure what to do in DC.""

In the hours following the riot, Miller allegedly replied to a tweet from Ocasio-Cortez that read, “Impeach,” indicating the congresswoman’s support to impeach former President Trump Donald TrumpSacha Baron Cohen calls out 'danger of lies, hate and conspiracies' in Golden Globes speech Sorkin uses Abbie Hoffman quote to condemn Capitol violence: Democracy is 'something you do' Ex-Trump aide Pierson planning run for Congress MORE for his involvement in provoking the riot.

The criminal complaint noted that in response, Miller wrote “we acted with honor and we where [sic] not armed,” and then, in an additional reply, added, “Assassinate AOC.”

Miller on social media also vocalized his anger with the fatal shooting of one of the rioters, Ashli Babbitt. According to the criminal complaint, Miller threatened to find the Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt and “hug his neck with a nice rope.”

Days later, Miller allegedly wrote in a Facebook post that the officer was “not going to survive long,” and that he “deserve[s] to die,” adding that it was “huntin season.”

Miller was arrested in the Northern District of Texas on Wednesday and made his first court appearance Friday, according to Justice Department records.

The Texas man faces a total of five charges: unlawful entry, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, obstructing an official proceeding and acts of civil disorder and threats made online, according to the court filing.

Ocasio-Cortez responded to the charges on Twitter Friday, specifically citing one tweet in which Miller wrote, “just wanted to incriminate myself a little,” after posting a selfie at the Capitol.

She added in a follow-up tweet, “On one hand you have to laugh, and on the other know that the reason they were this brazen is because they thought they were going to succeed.”

As of Saturday, the Justice Department has already charged more than 135 individuals for committing crimes on or around the grounds of the Capitol, with more charges expected in the coming weeks and months.

Ocasio-Cortez, who has called on Trump and his supporters to be held responsible in connection to the riot, revealed last week in an Instagram video that she had a ""close encounter"" during the riot in which she feared for her life.

177,178,https://news.bitcoin.com/janet-yellen-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-regulation/,"Joe Biden’s pick to become the new U.S. Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, has clarified her stance on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. This follows her remarks during a Senate hearing when she said that cryptocurrencies are mostly used for illicit financing.

Janet Yellen clarified her position on the regulation of cryptocurrencies in a written testimony published Thursday following the Senate hearing on her nomination as the Treasury Secretary. During the hearing, Yellen made some statements regarding cryptocurrencies which were heavily criticized as being inaccurate.

The finance committee began by briefly describing the benefits and risks of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin and other digital and cryptocurrencies are providing financial transactions around the globe, like many technological developments, this offers potential benefits for the U.S., and our allies,” the written testimony reads. “At the same time, it also presents opportunities for states and non-state actors looking to circumvent the current financial system and undermine American interests. For example, the Central Bank of China just issued its first digital currency.”

“Dr. Yellen, what do you view as the potential threats and benefits these innovations and technologies will have on U.S. national security? Do you think more needs to be done to ensure we have appropriate safeguards and regulations for digital and cryptocurrencies in place?” the finance committee asked the Treasury Secretary nominee.

Yellen replied: “I think it important we consider the benefits of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, and the potential they have to improve the efficiency of the financial system.”

She continued, “At the same time, we know they can be used to finance terrorism, facilitate money laundering, and support malign activities that threaten U.S. national security interests and the integrity of the U.S. and international financial systems,” elaborating:

“If confirmed, I intend to work closely with the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking and securities regulators on how to implement an effective regulatory framework for these and other fintech innovations,” Yellen concluded.

Yellen’s clarification marginally softens her stance on cryptocurrency, contrasting her previous statements made during her confirmation Senate hearing. “Cryptocurrencies are a particular concern. I think many are used … mainly for illicit financing and I think we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail their use and make sure that anti-money laundering (sic) doesn’t occur through those channels,” Yellen said a few days prior.

Last week, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christian Lagarde, also made a statement about bitcoin that drew much criticism. She said bitcoin “has conducted some funny business and some interesting and totally reprehensible money laundering activity.” Many were also quick to point out how wrong Lagarde was, including a famed economist who said her statement was “outrageous.” He stressed that “we all know that the vast majority of money laundering globally is conducted in fiat currencies, particularly in U.S. dollars and euros.”

178,179,https://wiky.com/2021/01/23/top-spanish-general-resigns-over-allegations-of-vaccination-queue-jumping/,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's top general resigned on Saturday after allegations he had received the COVID-19 vaccine ahead of priority groups, one of a number of public officials who have sparked public anger because of reports they have jumped the vaccination queue.

Defence Minister Margarita Robles had asked General Miguel Angel Villaroya, chief of defence staff, for explanations after media reports on Friday that he had received the vaccination.

In a statement on his resignation, the defence ministry indicated but did not explicitly state that Villaroya had had the vaccination. The general ""never intended to take advantage of unjustifiable privileges which damaged the image of the Armed Forces and put in doubt the honour of the general,"" it said.

It added that Villaroya ""took decisions which he thought to be correct"" but which ""damaged the public image of the Armed Forces"".

It was not immediately possible to contact Villaroya for comment.

At start of the pandemic, Villaroya represented the military at media daily briefings where he detailed how troops were cleaning care homes and caring for elderly residents.

Spaniards have been indignant over the queue-jumping.

""General Villarroya and other colleagues, my companion is 67, has Alzheimer's and is blind. We are waiting for the vaccine. A clerk and a former nurse and we are in the first group. Are you more important?"" tweeted a user with the handle @Marcosendra1.

179,180,https://www.metro.us/french-covid-19-intensive-care/,"PARIS (Reuters) – The number of people with coronavirus in French intensive care units fell by 16 to 2,896 in data released on Saturday, the first decline in two weeks after a period of sharp rises.

The number of people in intensive care is a key measure of a health system’s ability to cope with the pandemic.

The government has said it wanted that figure to hold steady between 2,500 and 3,000 before considering loosening curfew restrictions, but it had been increasingly steadily since early January.

The health ministry also reported 23,924 new confirmed COVID-19 cases over the past 24 hours, up from 23,292 on Friday and 21,406 last Saturday. France’s cumulative number of cases stands at 3.04 million.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister congratulated Mr Biden on his inauguration, and warmly welcomed his decision to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change and the World Health Organisation – both abandoned by Donald Trump.

Following the call, Mr Johnson tweeted: “Great to speak to President Joe Biden this evening.

“I look forward to deepening the long-standing alliance between our two countries as we drive a green and sustainable recovery from Covid19.”

A No 10 spokesman said they had also discussed the potential benefits of a free trade deal, with the Prime Minister reiterating his intention to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible.

“The Prime Minister praised President Biden’s early action on tackling climate change and commitment to reach net zero by 2050,” the spokesman said.

“Building on the UK and US’ long history of cooperation in security and defence, the leaders re-committed to the NATO alliance and our shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy.

“The leaders looked forward to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow, and to working together through the G7, G20 and Cop26 this year.”

It is reported that Mr Johnson is the first European leader to have spoken to the new president, after he had calls on Friday with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

There will be some relief in Downing Street at the early call amid concerns about the way Mr Johnson’s perceived closeness to Mr Trump would be seen by the new administration.

The Prime Minister is regarded with deep suspicion by some senior Democrats around Mr Biden who – unlike the former president – was no fan of Brexit.

Many were offended by his sideswipe at the “part-Kenyan” Barack Obama during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, while Mr Biden once described him as a “physical and emotional clone” of Mr Trump.

Following the inauguration, No 10 sought to play down Mr Biden’s decision to remove a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office – even though Mr Johnson had criticised Mr Obama when he did the same thing.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The Oval Office is the president’s private office and it’s up to the president to decorate it as he wishes.

Authorities allege that Miller posted photos and videos on his social media accounts that show him inside the Capitol during the January 6 storming of the building by supporters of then-president Donald Trump.

It is also alleged that he called for violence in online posts, including a tweet that simply read: “Assassinate AOC,” a reference to Ms Ocasio-Cortez.

In another tweet, Miller posted: “They are right next time we bring the guns,” an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit.

Miller also threatened a US Capitol police officer during an exchange on Instagram, writing that he planned to “hug his neck with a nice rope”, the affidavit states.

After posting a photo on Facebook showing him inside the Capitol, Miller responded to a comment on the picture with: “just want to incriminate myself a little lol,” according to an FBI affidavit.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez posted Miller’s charging documents on Twitter on Friday and then tweeted: “On one hand you have to laugh, and on the other know that the reason they were this brazen is because they thought they were going to succeed.”

On Tuesday, the county board voted 9-0 to support the township’s application for the grant from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy through its Consolidation and Contamination Risk Reduction program.

With the grant, the township could supply clean, safe water to residents at a significantly reduced per parcel cost, according to a resolution passed by the board.

The grant would provide a “more manageable financial commitment from township residents” and help bring “clean, reliable and safe drinking water” to residents, the resolution said.

The water extension is estimated to cost $18.5 million with a per-parcel cost of about $25,000 per household.

“Due to the higher per-parcel cost, this is a financial hardship for residents and the project has struggled to secure the required number of property owner petition signatures” to come up with a special assessment district, the resolution said.

With the county board’s backing, it will demonstrate the township has the full support of the county and city as a supplier of the water supply, officials said.

The county’s affirmative vote was needed to “substantiate the resolution,” Tom Graham, the board’s attorney, said.

The township has been working for the past couple of years to address poor water quality in local wells.

The township has retained the services of Mannik & Smith Group Inc., a local engineering firm, to complete a preliminary engineering report on the feasibility and cost to bring an improved water supply to the township.",County backs London Twp. grant to extend water lines,www.sturgisjournal.com

Saturday also saw the country's daily infections hitting a new high at 15,333. To date, Portugal has recorded 10,194 deaths and 624,469 cases, DGS said.

The surge in infections and deaths in the past week -- mainly attributed to the coronavirus variant first detected in Britain -- has prompted the government to close schools for 15 days.

As the world is struggling to contain the pandemic, vaccination is underway in Portugal and other countries with the already-authorized coronavirus vaccines.

The three-year-old filly had saluted at the same track over 1050m back on 30 December in Class 1 company and Gollan stepped up the test here asking Bleu Zebra to tackle 1200m in a Three-Year-Old Fillies Handicap … a test she passed with flying colours.

‘I think scratchings played a part in the trace. Once Natalie McCall’s horse (Magic Delta) came out it sort of paved the way for the race to unfold the way it did,” offered Gollan.

“It probably was the natural leader and we were probably going to be outside of it which might have made life a little bit trickier.

“When that came out, our plan was just to let Bleu Zebra get there on her own terms. She has wanted to run her races a bit upside down and be a bit aggressive in her races, but I think Georgina (Cartwright) has done a great job since she has ridden her. She rode her the other day in the race at Doomben (which Bleu Zebra won) and she got her to relax beautifully just outside the lead.

“Today, she just took her time … just let her use her natural speed to cross them. At no stage did she look like she wanted to over-race. When she came down the dip and gave a kick, she put the race beyond doubt pretty early.

“Georgina is doing a great job. She is in her first twelve months out of her time and that is always the hardest time for any jockey. She is a hard worker and a great person.”

‘We had a little bit of an awkward barrier,” added Cartwright. “She is the type of horse … you don’t really want to dig her up and then ask her to come back, so I just cruised with her, It is a nice, long run to the first turn.

188,189,https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/prime-minister-welcome-as-prime-minister-not-politicians/cid/1804605,"A family member of Subhas Chandra Bose stood firm against the politicisation of Netaji’s 125th birth anniversary celebrations, refusing to allow any member of the BJP to accompany Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the freedom fighter’s ancestral home at Elgin Road in Calcutta on Saturday.

Sources said Netaji’s grandnephew Sugata Bose, a historian who chairs the Netaji Research Bureau, received a call from the Prime Minister’s Office on Saturday afternoon that Modi wanted to visit Netaji Bhavan and that some BJP leaders would accompany the PM.

Sugata — also a former MP for Trinamul — refused to allow entry to any politician other than the Prime Minister.

He said that Modi was welcome as the Prime Minister, but the event shouldn’t be politicised.

“Initially what was sent (the itinerary) looked like he (Modi) would come with some political functionaries of his party. I said that it is the occasion of Netaji’s birth anniversary and (so) the PM should come as a PM,” Sugata told this paper.

BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya, the party’s minder for the state, and Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta were present outside Netaji Bhavan to welcome Modi. They were joined by another grandnephew of Netaji, BJP leader Chandra Kumar Bose.

None of the other BJP leaders entered the premises, and many waited outside. Vijayvargiya left soon afterwards. A few BJP supporters raised Jai Shri Ram slogans in front of Netaji Bhavan.

A section of Bengal BJP said a family member of Bose snubbing BJP leaders would not send a good message ahead of the polls in Bengal. “Our leaders wanted to show their love for Netaji by accompanying the PM to Netaji Bhavan. What happened is a face loss,” a member said.

Sugata said this was the first time a communication about the Prime Minister’s visit (to Netaji Bhavan) was announced a few hours before the event.

“Whenever Prime Ministers have visited in the past, the PMO has always been in touch long in advance. This time, I directly heard from the PMO only a little before 1 o’clock today (Saturday).”

According to his original itinerary, the Prime Minister’s first stop was supposed to be the National Library. Sources said a change was made to the itinerary late on Friday when it was decided that Modi would visit Netaji Bhavan.

Chandra Kumar Bose claimed that he had placed a request with the PM “through appropriate sources”, requesting him to visit Netaji’s ancestral house. “I’m happy that the Honourable PM accepted my request,” Bose said, adding that the visit was a last-minute inclusion to the PM’s itinerary, ahead of the main event on Victoria Memorial lawns.

The saffron brigade had also started a narrative that no Prime Minister other than Lal Bahadur Shastri and Modi had ever visited Netaji Bhavan on January 23. Refuting this claim, Sugata said that in 1995, then PM P.V. Narasimha Rao had visited the house on Netaji’s birth anniversary.","PM welcome as PM, not politicians",www.telegraphindia.com
189,190,https://www.parisguardian.com/news/267623758/larry-king-giant-of-us-broadcasting-dies-at-87,"Legendary US broadcaster Larry King, who interviewed world leaders, movie stars and ordinary people, and helped define American conversation for half a century, has died. He was 87.

King died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, Ora Media, the studio and network he co-founded, tweeted. No cause of death was given, but CNN reported Jan. 2 that King had been hospitalised for more than a week with COVID-19. His son Chance also confirmed King's death.

A longtime nationally syndicated radio host, from 1985 through 2010 he was a nightly fixture on CNN, where he won many honours, including two Peabody awards.

With his celebrity interviews, political debates and topical discussions, King wasn't just an enduring on-air personality. He also set himself apart with the curiosity he brought to every interview, whether questioning the assault victim known as the Central Park jogger or billionaire industrialist Ross Perot, who in 1992 rocked the presidential contest by announcing his candidacy on King's show.

In its early years, ""Larry King Live"" was based in Washington, which gave the show an air of gravitas. Likewise King. He was the plainspoken go-between through whom Beltway bigwigs could reach their public, and they did, earning the show prestige as a place where things happened, where news was made.

King conducted an estimated 50,000 on-air interviews. In 1995 he presided over a Middle East peace summit with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He welcomed everyone from the Dalai Lama to Elizabeth Taylor, from Mikhail Gorbachev to Barack Obama, Bill Gates to Lady Gaga.

Especially after he relocated to Los Angeles, his shows were frequently in the thick of breaking celebrity news, including Paris Hilton talking about her stint in jail in 2007 and Michael Jackson's friends and family members talking about his death in 2009.

'I don't pretend to know it all'

King boasted of never overpreparing for an interview. His non-confrontational style relaxed his guests and made him readily relatable to his audience.

""I don't pretend to know it all,"" he said in a 1995 Associated Press interview. ""Not, 'What about Geneva or Cuba?'... I ask, 'Mr President, what don't you like about this job?' Or 'What's the biggest mistake you made?' That's fascinating.""

Funeral arrangements and a memorial service will be announced later in coordination with the King family, ""who ask for their privacy at this time"", according to the tweet from Ora Media.","Larry King, giant of US broadcasting, dies at 87",www.parisguardian.com

The mood is more sober now — a mix of disappointment over Trump's defeat and hope that his legacy of judicial appointments will lead to future court victories limiting abortion rights.

Organizers of this year's March for Life in Washington, scheduled for next Friday, have asked their far-flung supporters to stay home, due to political tensions in the city and the coronavirus pandemic. They plan instead to livestream the activities of a few invited participants, a sharp contrast to the tens of thousands of people who usually attend.

Meanwhile, Trump, whose administration took numerous steps to curtail abortion access, has been replaced as president by Joe Biden, a staunch supporter of abortion rights. Biden's fellow Democrats now control both chambers of Congress, thanks to victories in two Senate runoff elections in Georgia where anti-abortion groups campaigned vigorously for the Republican candidates who lost.

On Friday, the 48th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris said they would seek to enshrine that right into federal law to protect it from court challenges,

""In the past four years, reproductive health, including the right to choose, has been under relentless and extreme attack."" their statement said. ""We are deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care – including reproductive health care.""

The president of the March for Life, Jeanne Mancini, said she and her allies worry the Biden administration will pursue ""radical pro-abortion extremism."" At the same time, anti-abortion activists are buoyed by Trump's appointment of scores of federal judges – including three Supreme Court justices – who are viewed as open to repealing or weakening Roe v. Wade,.

In Republican-governed states, scores of tough anti-abortion bills have been enacted in recent years, and more are surfacing this year from GOP lawmakers eager to see if any of these measures might reach the Supreme Court as a challenge to Roe v. Wade.

""I am very optimistic."" said Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee. ""We'll see a lot of new pro-life bills... and we are going to see judges who are open to them.""

In Arkansas, a new bill would criminalize abortions except to save a pregnant woman's life. The measure declares: ""It is time for the United States Supreme Court to redress and correct the grave injustice and the crime against humanity which is being perpetuated by its decisions in Roe v. Wade"" and other cases.

The Texas legislature also will consider several sweeping abortion bans. In Montana, anti-abortion bills are expected to advance now that Republican Greg Gianforte has replaced Democrat Steve Bullock as governor. Bullock supported abortion rights during eight years in office.

South Carolina lawmakers are considering a bill that would ban on abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually around six weeks after conception. Similar bills have passed in several other states, but courts have blocked their implementation.

Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state government issues for the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, says anti-abortion legislation may get top priority even in states where lawmakers confront multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and severe budgetary woes.

Referring to anti-abortion lawmakers, Nash said, ""They see the Supreme Court as being in their corner, and it's their job to continue to pass restrictions and bans.""

Among abortion-rights activists, there's relief and optimism as the Biden administration takes power Biden is expected to soon issue executive orders reversing anti-abortion actions taken by Trump.

One such order would rescind the so-called ""global gag rule"" that prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance for abortion-related services. Another order would rescind what abortion-rights supporters called the ""domestic gag rule,"" barring Title X family planning funds from going to any health care providers who perform abortions or make referrals for them. The ban prompted Planned Parenthood, the leading abortion provider in the U.S., to quit the program rather than comply.

Abortion-rights supporters also hope that Congress, under Democratic control, will repeal the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for abortions unless a woman's life is in danger or in cases of rape or incest.

Biden, a longtime supporter of the amendment, reversed himself in 2019 and now favors its repeal. But prospects for repeal are uncertain, given that Democrats would need some Republican votes in the Senate to overcome a potential filibuster.

However, the Democrats' narrow Senate majority is expected to be sufficient to confirm Biden's nomination of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra – a strong supporter of abortion rights -- to head the Department of Health and Human Services.

Major anti-abortion groups invested large sums and mobilized hundreds of volunteers to back the losing GOP Senate candidates in Georgia, hoping to retain Republican control so Becerra could be rejected.

Becerra and Biden are Roman Catholic, and the new administration's support for abortion rights poses a dilemma for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Its president, Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez, congratulated Biden on his inauguration Wednesday, yet warned that his policies on abortion and contraception ""advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity.""

Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood, said the worries that plagued her throughout 2020 gave way to joy with the Democrats' Senate victories in Georgia.

""I was actually able to breathe in hope and possibility,"" she said. ""But we recognize the fact that the fight is ongoing -- the courts and many of our state legislatures are going to be very difficult for us.""

While not yet enough data exists yet to show whether abortions have increased or decreased during the pandemic, there's some evidence that more women induced their own abortions, using abortion pills they were able to purchase or receive by mail from a foreign source. It's become increasingly easy for women to circumvent the U.S. law requiring the pill to be dispensed by a health care professional.

Abigail Aiken, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas, said the online abortion pill provider Aid Access received a surge of requests early in the pandemic, when some states cited the outbreak as a reason to limit abortion access at clinics.

Requests nearly doubled in Texas, which had the most severe pandemic-related restrictions on clinics, said Aiken, whose research was published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology.

Elisa Wells, co-director of another online organization called Plan C, estimates that tens of thousands of American women annually are now seeking abortion pills for self-managed abortions – based on the number of clicks on Plan C's website that lists overseas pharmacies offering to ship the pills.",Political upheaval alters strategies in US abortion debate,www.richmondregister.com

President Cyril Ramaphosa led the tributes to the legendary musician who was nominated for an Oscar for the theme song of the 1987 film “Cry Freedom”.

“A giant of our revolutionary cultural movement and our democratic creative industries has been called to rest,” Ramaphosa said.

“The trombone that boomed with boldness and bravery, and equally warmed our hearts with mellow melody has lost its life force” the president added.

There were no immediate details on how or where Gwangwa died.

He passed away on the third anniversary of the death of the “father of South African jazz” Hugh Masekela and the second anniversary of the death of Zimbabwean musical legend Oliver Mtukudzi. Jan. 23 had become “the day the music died” The South African and other media outlets said.

Gwangwa was born in October 1937 in Soweto and went on to have a career spanning 40 years.

“He delighted audiences in Sophiatown until it became illegal for black people to congregate and South African musicians were jailed merely for practicing their craft,” the presidency’s statement said.

He was awarded the Order of Ikhamanga, South Africa’s highest national award presented for achievements in art and culture, in 2010.

192,193,https://www.wvasfm.org/post/fauci-relishes-hallelujah-moment,"Dr. Anthony Fauci says letting the science speak on the pandemic got him ""into a little bit of trouble"" during the Trump administration. President Donald Trump had called the nation's top infectious disease expert part of a group of ""idiots"" and a ""disaster"" and suggested that he might fire Fauci after the election, which Trump ended up losing.

So, Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser on COVID-19, says he rejoiced when the new president declared that ""science and truth"" would guide the nation's policies on the pandemic.

""I said, 'Hallelujah,' you know?"" Fauci told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly on Friday.

""That's a very liberating feeling, where people don't have to be worried about when you're saying something that you're going to get pushback from your own team,"" he says. ""There never will be pushback on scientific data. The president himself has told us that he wants nothing but the truth based on science and good evidence.""

Fauci, 80, who was appointed director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 1984, said that he felt free to talk about the science of the disease under Trump, but others didn't.

""I said exactly what the science spoke in the last administration,"" Fauci said. ""It got me into a little bit of trouble — not really trouble because it didn't bother me.

""But it did get a bit of pushback from people in the White House, including the president. When I spoke — and I didn't change anything I would have done — I have always spoken according to what the scientific data and the scientific evidence allowed me to say. But that wasn't always the case for everybody else.""

It was a big comeback week for Fauci, who had become noticeably absent from White House briefings after publicly contradicting Trump.

In addition to White House briefings, Fauci revealed Friday that he had been blocked from going on The Rachel Maddow Show for months, despite him wanting to appear and the show requesting him. The Trump administration ""didn't like the way you handle things and they didn't want me on there,"" Fauci told Maddow.

The White House had blocked Fauci from appearing on various television shows throughout the past year.

Fauci told Maddow the Biden administration would not have a ""deliberate holding back of good people when the press asks for them.""

At a White House briefing on Thursday — his first under Biden — Fauci said that under Trump, ""it was very clear that there were things that were said — be it regarding things like hydroxychloroquine and other things like that — that really was uncomfortable because they were not based on scientific fact.""

And earlier that day, Fauci said he was ""honored"" to announce that the United States would remain a member of the World Health Organization. That was a reversal of Trump's move to leave the United Nations health agency. Trump had complained about the organization's moves early in the pandemic and accused the WHO of bowing to pressure from China.",Fauci Relishes A 'Hallelujah' Moment,www.wvasfm.org

PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona Republicans voted Saturday to censure Cindy McCain and two prominent GOP members who have found themselves crosswise with former President Donald Trump.

The censures of Sen. John McCain’s widow, former Sen. Jeff Flake and Gov. Doug Ducey are merely symbolic. But they show the party’s foot soldiers are focused on enforcing loyalty to Trump, even in the wake of an election that saw Arizona inch away from its staunchly Republican roots.

Party activists also reelected controversial Chairwoman Kelli Ward, who has been one of Trump’s most unflinching supporters and among the most prolific promoters of his baseless allegations of election fraud.

The Arizona GOP’s combative focus has delighted Trump’s staunchest supporters and worried Republican insiders who have watched the party lose ground in the suburbs as the influence of its traditional conservative establishment has faded in favor of Trump. A growing electorate of young Latinos and newcomers bringing their more liberal politics from back home have further hurt the GOP.

“This is a time for choosing for Republicans. Are we going to be the conservative party?” said Kirk Adams, a former state House speaker and chief of staff to Ducey. “Or is this a party ... that’s loyal to a single person?”

It’s a question of Republican identity that party officials and activists are facing across the country following Trump’s 2020 loss, and particularly after a mob of his supporters laid siege on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

Nowhere is the question more acute than Arizona, where the state GOP’s unflinching loyalty to Trump stands out even in a party that’s been remade everywhere in the image of the former president.

Ward has relentlessly — but unsuccessfully — sued to overturn the election results. The party has used its social media accounts to urge followers to fight and perhaps even to die in support of Trump’s false claims of victory. Two of the state’s four Republican congressmen are accused of playing a role in organizing the Jan. 6 rally that turned violent.

After dominating Arizona politics for decades, Republicans now find themselves on their heels in the state’s highest offices. President Joe Biden narrowly eked out a victory here, becoming just the second Democrat in more than five decades to win the state. Consecutive victories in 2018 and 2020 gave Democrats control of both U.S. Senate seats for the first time in nearly 70 years.

Ward, a physician and former state legislator who lost two Republican primaries for the U.S. Senate, defeated three challengers to win a second term.

In a brief interview, Ward acknowledged “disappointment at the top of the ticket” but said she and many other Republicans still question the results showing victories for Biden and Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. Judges have rejected eight lawsuits challenging Arizona’s election results.

Ward pointed to GOP successes down the ballot, noting Republicans defied expectations in local races.

Ward said she’s a “Trump Republican” who will “always put America first, who believes in faith, family and freedom.” The way forward for the GOP, she said, is keeping Trump’s 74 million voters engaged.

“Yes, I will be radical about those things because those are the things that keep this country great,” Ward said. “The people who are complaining are the people who actually put us in this spot where we are in Arizona, people who have been mamby pamby, lie down and allow the Democrats to walk all over them.”

The censures target some of Arizona’s most prominent Republicans,

Cindy McCain endorsed Biden and became a powerful surrogate for the Democrat following years of attacks by Trump on her husband. After the vote, she wrote on Twitter that “it is a high honor to be included in a group of Arizonans who have served our state and our nation so well.”

“I’ll wear this as a badge of honor,” she wrote.

Also after the vote, Flake tweeted a photo of him with McCain and Ducey at Biden’s inauguration and wrote: “Good company.”

Flake was one of the few congressional Republicans who was openly critical of Trump for failing to adhere to conservative values. He declined to run for reelection in 2018 and endorsed Biden in last year’s election.

“If condoning the President’s behavior is required to stay in the Party’s good graces, I’m just fine being on the outs,” Flake wrote on Twitter before and after the vote.

Ducey is being targeted for his restrictions on individuals and businesses to contain the spread of COVID-19. While it’s not mentioned in the proposed censure, he had a high-profile break with the president when he signed the certification of Biden’s victory.

“These resolutions are of no consequence whatsoever and the people behind them have lost whatever little moral authority they may have once had,” said Sara Mueller, Ducey’s political director.

Many traditional conservatives fret that the censures and Ward’s combative style turn off the swing voters and ticket-splitters who handed Democrats their recent victories. But they say the party’s decisions will reflect only the views of about 1,500 committed activists.

John McCain was censured by the state GOP in 2014 and went on to comfortably win a Republican primary over Ward and a general election. The self-described maverick, known best for his willingness to buck his party, had strained relations with the state party for much of his career but was consistently reelected by wide margins.","Arizona Republicans censure Cindy McCain, GOP governor",apnews.com

News of her departure should be met with a sense of relief. Mme Payette could have chosen to fight the charges of workplace harassment outlined in an independent report commissioned by the government. She could have dared the prime minister to request that the Queen dismiss her. Thankfully, Canadians have been spared that spectacle, along with the institutional sullying and embarrassment that would have accompanied it. The question before us now is how to avoid a similar situation in the future. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Lagassé: Who does Canada want as governor general? First, it is important to get the fundamentals out of the way. The office of the Governor General is not going to be abolished. It is protected by the unanimous constitutional amending procedure outlined in section 41 of the Constitution Act 1982. Getting rid of the office would require the agreement of Parliament and all provincial legislatures, as it would to get rid of the monarchy itself. Not only do we all have better things to do right now, but political conditions are not present to allow for a wholesale revamping of Canada’s highest offices.

Similarly, the Queen’s power to appoint the governor general on the advice of the prime minister is included as part of her office, which means that changing how we appoint her representative would involve the unanimous amending procedure, too. There is no point floating the idea of directly electing the governor general or even arguing that the House of Commons or members of the Order of Canada should pick the person. Accepting that the office is not going anywhere, we can focus on the key issue: ensuring that we appoint candidates who are well-suited to the role. Vice-regal officeholders should be committed to public service and be enthusiastic about meeting and celebrating the accomplishments of Canadians. While the job necessarily involves representing the Queen, it is also about representing Canadians to themselves, without the partisan hue that surrounds politicians who try to do the same. Over the decades, the office has taken on quite a bit of patronage work, too, which sees the governor general helping charities raise funds for laudable causes. Anyone who is uncomfortable with the demands and pace of these activities should not occupy the office. Likewise, anyone who cherishes their privacy should steer clear of Rideau Hall. Most importantly, though, the governor general has core constitutional duties to perform. Normally, these are formalities, such as granting royal assent to legislation and signing various official documents. But there are instances when the governor general has to act with discretion, exercising sound practical judgement.

For example, the governor general may decide to refuse a prime minister’s advice to dissolve Parliament if we recently had an election, the government has lost the confidence of the House of Commons, and there is another party leader who can form a viable ministry. The governor general may need to have uncomfortable chats with the prime minister about things the government is planning that aren’t constitutionally wise or proper. In a crisis or emergency, furthermore, the governor general may be called upon to replace the prime minister. However rare these cases may be, they compel us to appoint governors general who have the strength of character to stand up to an errant government when necessary, and to go through the formal motions the rest of the time. Finding someone who has both a strong commitment to national service and the judgment to act as a constitutional guardian is not easy. When we add bilingualism and past professional excellence to the mix, the task becomes that much harder. There is no question, moreover, that we should strive to appoint vice-regal representatives who reflect Canadian multiculturalism and diversity. In response to these criteria, commentators have emphasized procedural reforms, such as more rigorous candidate vetting and the revival of the vice-regal appointments committee established by prime minister Stephen Harper. These are important steps, but they are focused on form over substance. Our starting point should be recognizing the particular qualities we are looking for in a vice-regal representative and not confusing them with other accomplishments. Let us first be clear about what we want in our governors general before we figure out the best way to find them.

195,196,https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/nirmala-sitharaman-launches-the-union-budget-mobile-app/cid/1804583,"This year, for the first time since Independence, the budget documents will not be printed but will be uploaded on a website

The countdown for the Union Budget 2021, to be presented on February 1, began with the traditional ‘Halwa ceremony’ in the North Block on Saturday.

A customary Halwa ceremony is performed every year before the “lock-in” process of the budget preparation begins.

However, this year the budget documents will not be printed but will be uploaded on a website. This would be the first time since Independence that the budget documents and the Economic Survey, to be tabled on January 29, would not be printed.

However, to upload the documents, 30 to 40 finance ministry officials would be required to stay at the North Block compared with other years when over 100 officials would stay inside the basement of the North Block where the press is located.

On the occasion, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman launched the “Union Budget Mobile App” for access to budget documents by members of Parliament (MPs) and the general public.

The general feeling among experts this year is that the budget should focus on demand side issues as the government has been busy fixing supply side concerns since March 2020 when the pandemic began to pummel the economy.

“It is high time to change gears and focus on the demand side as well, lest the ongoing recovery begins to lose steam. There is nothing wrong in addressing the supply-side issues, as it was necessary to augment the broken supply chains. But, lack of adequate demand may jeopardise the recovery and may even lead to a second-round impact,” Sunil Kumar Sinha of India Ratings warned in a note.

Sinha warned that even if the supply-side bottlenecks get restored on account of various government/RBI measures it may soon run into difficulties due to the lack of adequate demand for goods and services.

“The economy has shown some green shoots with several high frequency indicators reaching the pre-pandemic level of production, bolstered by a combination of festive/pent-up demand. But, after two consecutive months of positive growth, the factory output contracted in November, showing the fragility of the recovery. Therefore an appropriate demand-side measure therefore is as important as supply-side measures,” he said.

Expecting the Budget, to be tabled on February 1, to focus on boosting aggregate demand, expenditure reprioritisation and mobilising higher non-tax revenue, Sinha lists the following priorities.

During this period of isolation, the officials are not allowed to contact their families through phone or any other form of communication, such as e-mail, texts. Only very senior officials in the finance ministry are permitted to go home. Mobile phone jammers are installed to block phone calls. Internet connections of staff and senior officials are cut. Phone calls made through landlines installed are closely monitored. They will only emerge once the Finance Minister presents the Budget in Parliament.

During the ""lock in"" period, visitors are normally not allowed in the North Block, and if permitted, they are escorted by security personnel to the officer they wish to visit. Departments, which deal with taxation policies and which form the heart of the budget-making exercise, are kept under strict armed guard. A team of senior intelligence bureau officials keep watch on the denizens of the North Block and their visitors as well as on the regular security personnel.

Corporate lobbyists usually target the officers of the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Central Board of Excise and Customs who work on the complicated number crunching and tax structure. Cyber security and spyware ensures there is no eavesdropping.

Indications are that Bahi khata, the red bag reminiscence of the traditional account books, would give way to the laptop, symbolism of new digital India. She had in 2019 July discarded the colonial legacy of carrying the budget documents in a briefcase. The word ‘budget’ has its origin in the French word Bougette, which means leather briefcase.

Sitharaman also launched the “Union Budget Mobile App” for hassle-free access of Budget documents by Members of Parliament (MPs) and the general public.

“The mobile App facilitates complete access to 14 Union Budget documents, including the Annual Financial Statement (commonly known as Budget), Demand for Grants (DG), Finance Bill etc. as prescribed by the Constitution,” a finance ministry release said.

The Budget documents will be available on the Mobile App after the completion of the Budget Speech by the Finance Minister in the Parliament. “The App has a user-friendly interface with embedded features of downloading, printing, search, zoom in and out, bidirectional scrolling, table of contents and external links, etc. It is bilingual (English & Hindi) and will be available on both Android and iOS platforms,” the official release said.

The App can also be downloaded from the Union Budget Web Portal (www.indiabudget.gov.in) and has been developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) under the guidance of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA).

The Budget for FY22 will come against the backdrop of an economic contraction of 7.7 per cent, the first time in the history of independent India. So, all stakeholders have great expectations from the upcoming Budget, which could provide a healing touch to the pandemic-battered economy and push growth. Even the Finance Minister last month promised a ''never before'' like Union Budget to the people of India.",Sitharaman launches the 'Union Budget Mobile App',www.telegraphindia.com

Phase 2 also includes vaccinations for ""hospital staff, community (general practitioners) and medical specialists not yet immunized.""

It's this latter group that the dental association takes issue with in the letter. The association argues dentists should be included in Phase 2 ""along with our medical colleagues.""

""Dentistry is an essential service,"" the letter reads. ""More importantly, dental care, including aerosol-generating dental procedures, are provided to patients who cannot wear a mask during treatment.""

The association notes that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention include dentists alongside doctors and medical specialists in their COVID-19 vaccine schedule. B.C. dentists also cite Ontario's vaccine plan, which includes dentists in stage two.

""B.C. dentists continue to do everything they can to ensure dental offices are safe for patients and staff,"" the association's letter reads. ""Early access to vaccines will ensure continued access to urgent and emergency dental care.""

The B.C. government announced its full immunization plan on Friday, prioritizing residents by age rather than occupation.

The BC Teachers Federation expressed disappointment with that decision, saying teachers had hoped there would be prioritization for frontline workers. At the same time, the union acknowledged that vaccine supply is beyond its control and that the most vulnerable ""must be vaccinated first.""

""Teachers are stressed, anxious, and even afraid,"" the federation said in a statement. ""We do not have the layers of protection in our schools that exist in other environments. If teachers are not prioritized for a vaccine, this government must take immediate action to improve safety measures in our schools.""

Among those safety measures are mask mandates, better physical distancing and improved ventilation in schools, the union said.

197,198,https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a35297766/joe-biden-reverse-trump-global-gag-rule/,"One of Donald Trump's first moves as president in 2017 was to reinstate the Global Gag Rule—officially known as the Mexico City Policy. As ELLE reported then, the rule stripped ""funding for family planning services and child health initiatives from organizations around the world that offer or even mention abortion services.""

Per NPR, on Thursday, Dr. Anthony Fauci told the World Health Organization's executive board that President Joe Biden plans to revoke the Mexico City Policy ""as part of his broader commitment to protect women's health and advance gender equality at home and around the world.""

Under previous Republican administrations, the policy only applied to NGOs that receive family planning funds. But the Trump administration expanded it to apply to all organizations that receive any global health assistance from the U.S. This meant that maternal health initiatives, anti-Zika efforts, and HIV/AIDS work were also affected by the lack of federal funds. According to the Guttmacher Institute, the lack of funds additionally affected projects related to ""nutrition, malaria, water and sanitation, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases.""

In 2019, the Trump administration did further harm to those who receive healthcare through government funding. In February of that year, the administration first announced its plan to make it illegal for healthcare providers who receive federal funding to give patients referrals for abortions. As ELLE.com pointed out that year, the rule disproportionately affected women and families of color who rely on federally funded programs for their overall healthcare. One of the biggest consequences of this rule came when Planned Parenthood decided to leave the federal program rather than comply with the Trump administration's new restrictions.

""The Trump administration has forced Planned Parenthood grantees out of Title X,"" said Alexis McGill Johnson, Planned Parenthood's president said in August 2019, per NPR. ""The impact of the Trump administration's gag rule will reverberate across the country.""

The Mexico City Policy is just one reported item on a long list of Trump actions the Biden administration plans to reverse. During his campaign, he pledged to overturn what reproductive advocates refer to as the ""gag rule on Title X"" as well. In fact, during his first three days in office, Biden signed 30 executive orders, including imposing a national mask mandate, reversing Trump's border wall and Muslim ban, and bolstering the Defense for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programs. Seventeen of these executive orders occurred on January 20, Biden's first day in office.

King is best known for the nightly interview TV program ""Larry King Live,"" which aired on CNN from 1985 to 2010.



LOS ANGELES, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Larry King, a veteran U.S. talk show host and former CNN interviewer, died on Saturday at the age of 87 after media reported earlier this month that he had been diagnosed with COVID-19.

""With profound sadness, Ora Media announces the death of our co-founder, host, and friend Larry King, who passed away this morning at age 87 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles,"" said a statement posted on King's social media account.

King hosted CNN's ""Larry King Live"" for over two and a half decades and retired in 2010 after clocking in at more than 6,000 episodes.

""For 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry's many thousands of interviews, awards and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster,"" said Ora Media, a television production company co-founded by King, in the statement.

""Whether he was interviewing a U.S. president, foreign leader, celebrity, scandal-ridden personage, or an everyman, Larry liked to ask short, direct, and uncomplicated questions,"" noted the statement.

King was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Nov. 19, 1933. He got his start as a broadcaster at a small radio station in Florida in 1957. King is best known for the nightly interview television program ""Larry King Live,"" which aired on CNN from 1985 to 2010. After his CNN career, King went on to be the host of Ora Media shows ""Larry King Now"" and ""Politicking With Larry King.""

""We mourn the passing of our colleague Larry King,"" CNN President Jeff Zucker said in a statement posted online, adding that King had a history-making career spanning radio and television.

""His curiosity about the world propelled his award-winning career in broadcasting, but it was his generosity of spirit that drew the world to him,"" Zucker noted.

King was honored with two Peabody Awards and 10 Cable ACE Awards in his career. He was also the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2011 News and Documentary Emmys.

No cause of death was given by Ora Media in the statement. Earlier this month, citing sources close to the family, CNN reported that King had been undergoing intensive treatment for over a week after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Besides Type 2 diabetes, King has also reportedly faced some other medical issues over years, such as heart attacks, angina and lung cancer.",Update: Veteran U.S. talk show host Larry King dies at 87,www.calcuttanews.net

• President Trump's pardons leave some of their subjects open to additional prosecution, experts say.
• His former campaign chair Paul Manafort could still be prosecuted for specific crimes he wasn't pardoned for.
• Even Michael Flynn, who received a wider-ranging pardon, could still have it tested by courts.

On his way out of office, President Donald Trump issued more than 100 pardons, mostly to his personal friends and political allies.

A number of those pardons were for people convicted of federal crimes linked to the Mueller investigation — including his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and advisors Roger Stone and George Papadopoulos.

Trump was sure to malign Mueller's investigation in his pardon notices. The press release for Manafort's pardon, for example, said he was ""prosecuted in the course of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation, which was premised on the Russian collusion hoax.""

Though the president's pardon powers are broad, a number of prosecutors and experts on clemency laws don't believe those people are off the hook just yet.

Trump pardoned Manafort for his specific convictions. It's much more narrowly tailored than the pardon Trump gave to Flynn, for ""any and all offenses arising out of the facts and circumstances"" brought by Robert Mueller's office.

Read more: Joe Biden is hiring about 4,000 political staffers to work in his administration. Here's how 3 experts say you can boost your chances of getting one of those jobs.

It's also narrower than the pardon President Gerald Ford gave to former President Richard Nixon, which covered a broad timeframe.

""It says 'for his conviction' and that's it. It's just for the crimes for which he was convicted,"" Kimberly Wehle, a University of Baltimore law professor, told Insider. ""That is a different wording than Richard Nixon received under his pardon, which is for 'all conceivable crimes.'""

Wehle, who worked under Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in the Justice Department, said presidents must specify the specific crimes being pardoned.

Beyond that, prosecutors can always try to bring different charges using the same set of underlying facts, she said.

The same point was brought up by Andrew Weissman, Mueller's second-in-command, in an article for the blog Just Security on Wednesday. Weissman argued that while Flynn's pardon left ""no room for now holding Flynn to account for his past felonious conduct,"" the pardon for Manafort was full of holes.

""Specifically, the pardon is solely for the crimes of conviction ... That leaves numerous crimes as to which Manafort can still be prosecuted, as in Virginia there were 10 hung counts,"" Weissman wrote. ""In Washington, the situation is even more wide open. In that district, Manafort pleaded to a superseding information containing two conspiracy charges, while the entire underlying indictment — containing numerous crimes from money laundering, to witness tampering, to violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act — now remains open to prosecution as there was no conviction for those charges.""

Read more: Could Trump mass-pardon his supporters who rioted at the Capitol? Constitutional-law experts weigh in.

There are other obstacles, too.

Prosecutors need to make sure they don't run afoul of the statute of limitations — though Manafort waived some of those protections, Weissman said. And a judge might decide that prosecutors are simply repackaging the same actions for which a person was pardoned into different crimes, which may run afoul of the Constitution's double jeopardy protection.

But Wehle said there's plenty of case law for judges to review. While federal prosecutors have rarely tried to go around presidential pardons, state-level prosecutors have often brought new criminal charges following governors' state-level pardons and succeeded.

""Say there was a robbery and a murder, and you're indicted and prosecuted for the robbery, and then later they come back and indict you and prosecute you for the murder,"" Wehle said. ""I don't think there's this a problem with fairness in there.""

Experts think Flynn may not be safe either

Some pardon attorneys even believe that federal prosecutors may still be able to bring new charges against Flynn.

Margaret Love, a clemency attorney and US Department of Justice pardon attorney between 1990 and 1997, believes the pardon for Flynn may have asserted powers that Trump didn't actually have.

Love told Insider that while Trump could grant Flynn clemency for the crimes he was prosecuted for, a judge might decide that the ""any and all offenses arising out of the facts and circumstances"" part of it might not hold water.

""The president can assert whatever power he has, but at issue is whether he has the power,"" Love said, adding: ""I believe there is a strong argument that the constitutional pardon power requires a degree of specificity as to what crime it is pardoning.""

Even the broad pardon Ford gave to Nixon, Love said, has never been tested. The Justice Department never brought the issue before a court to decide whether the sweeping nature of the pardon was valid.

The question of whether Flynn's pardon would prevent future prosecutions now depends on the appetite of Justice Department prosecutors, and it's an open question whether Biden's selection for attorney general, Merrick Garland, would choose to bring another case against him.

""Whoever is the prosecutor in the Flynn case will undoubtedly be looking closely at [the pardon] wording, just like Andrew Weissman was looking closely at [the] Manafort pardon,"" Love said. ""Then they will decide what to do.""

Attorneys for Manafort and Flynn didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

201,202,https://www.live5news.com/2021/01/23/crews-find-potential-time-capsule-base-calhoun-statue/,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - Crews found what they believe is the long-rumored time capsule hidden in the base of the former John C. Calhoun statue that once stood in downtown Charleston’s Marion Square.

They made the discovery at about noon Saturday as they continued cleanup of the area where the monument to the former statesman stood for 124 years. Historians say the capsule was originally buried in 1858, eight years after Calhoun died. But it was moved twice, ending up in its final resting place at the base of the statue.

“At least an iron tin, paper, textiles, there was a banner in a tin case that was carried in Calhoun’s funeral procession,” he said. “So, all of those materials will react differently once this thing is opened up to the air.”

Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg arrived shortly after crews found what they had been searching for. He said while the city voted to remove the statue after public outcry over Calhoun’s pro-slavery stance, he feels it is still important to protect the contents of a Calhoun time capsule.

“This is all appropriate I believe to preserve the history and be able to tell the stories for generations to come,” he said. “They’ve done an incredible job of meticulously taking apart the base in hopes of finding what we found here today.”

Back in October, City of Charleston Director of Parks Jason Kronsberg said that crews were expecting to find out if there is a time capsule in the statue. He said it would either be in a hollowed-out spot in the structure or a lead box.

Kronsberg said this time capsule was mentioned in a Post and Courier article nearly 100 years ago, and inside they think it may have several different items. Among those listed include a cannonball recovered from the harbor believed to have been used in the battle of Fort Moultrie, 100 dollars in Continental money, a lock of Calhoun’s hair, and more.",Crews find potential time capsule in base of Calhoun Statue in downtown Charleston,www.live5news.com
202,203,https://www.metro.us/italys-lombardy-spars-with/,"MILAN (Reuters) – Italy’s Lombardy region and the central government exchanged blame on Saturday over the release of COVID-19 data that wrongly condemned the region to stricter restrictions.

Lombardy, the country’s wealthiest and most productive area which includes the fashion capital Milan, was forced to close most shops a week ago after being classed “red” under Italy’s system of tiered restrictions.

Health Minister Roberto Speranza said on Saturday Lombardy had initially submitted wrong data, messing up calculations by Italy’s higher health council.

He then designated Lombardy as “orange”, allowing shops to reopen and older students to attend classes after they were forced to switch to distance learning.

Lombardy’s administration, led by the right-wing League party which has come under fire for its handling of the pandemic, hit back at Rome.

“They wanted us to say it was our mistake, but it wasn’t. I’ll never agree to saying there has been a mistake in the data we sent,” Governor Attilio Fontana told a press conference.

He said the region would press ahead with a lawsuit filed with an administrative court and seek money from the government to compensate shopkeepers who have been forced to close down just as the sales season was starting.

Retail association Confcommercio Milano estimated shops in Milan had lost around 100 million euros in revenue.

Lombardy, the country’s industrial heartland, accounts for more than a fifth of Italy’s 2.46 million COVID-19 cases to date.

With 26,622 deaths out of the national total of 85,162, it is by far the worst-hit region and was the epicentre of the pandemic during the first wave in the Spring.

203,204,https://www.997wtn.com/news/dems-make-federal-election-standards-a-top-priority/,"Democrats plan to move quickly on one of the first bills of the new Congress, citing the need for federal election standards and other reforms to shore up the foundations of American democracy after a tumultuous post-election period and deadly riot at the Capitol.

States have long had disparate and contradictory rules for running elections. But the 2020 election, which featured pandemic-related changes to ease voting and then a flood of lawsuits by former President Donald Trump and his allies, underscored the differences from state to state: Mail-in ballots due on Election Day or just postmarked by then? Absentee voting allowed for all or just voters with an excuse? Same-day or advance-only registration?

Democrats, asserting constitutional authority to set the time, place, and manner of federal elections, want national rules they say would make voting more uniform, accessible, and fair across the nation. The bill would mandate early voting, same-day registration, and other long-sought reforms some critics reject as federal overreach.

“We have just literally seen an attack on our own democracy,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said of the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol. “I cannot think of a more timely moment to start moving on democracy reform.”

The legislation first introduced two years ago, known as the For the People Act, also would give independent commissions the job of drawing congressional districts, require political groups to disclose high-dollar donors, create reporting requirements for online political ads and, in a rearview rebuke of Trump, obligate presidents to disclose their tax returns.

Republican opposition was fierce during the last session. At the time, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., labeled it the “Democrat Politician Protection Act” and wrote in an op-ed, Democrats were seeking to “change the rules of American politics to benefit one party.”

While Democrats control Congress for the first time in a decade, the measure’s fate depends on whether enough Republicans can be persuaded to reconsider a bill they have repeatedly rejected. If not, Democrats could decide it is time to take the extraordinary and difficult step of eliminating the Senate filibuster, a procedural tool often used by the minority party to block bills under rules that require 60 votes to advance legislation.

Advocates say the bill is the most consequential piece of voting legislation since the Voting Rights Act of 1965. House Democrats vowed two years ago to make the bill a priority, and they reintroduced it this month as H.R. 1, underscoring its importance to the party.

“People just want to be able to cast their vote without it being an ordeal,” Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., who is the lead sponsor of the House bill, said. “It’s crazy in America that you still have to navigate an obstacle course to get to the ballot box.”

Current plans would have the full House take up the bill as soon as the first week of February. The Senate Rules Committee would then consider a companion bill introduced in the Senate, and a tie vote there could allow it to move out of committee and to the floor as early as next month, said Klobuchar, who is expected to become the committee’s next chair.

A quick vote would be remarkable considering the Senate also is likely to be juggling Trump’s impeachment trial, confirmation of President Joe Biden’s Cabinet choices, and another round of coronavirus relief.

While states have long had different voting procedures, the November 2020 election highlighted how the variability could be used to sow doubt about the outcome. The bill’s supporters, which include national voting and civil rights organizations, cited dozens of pre-election lawsuits that challenged procedural rules, such as whether ballots postmarked on Election Day should count.

They also pointed to the post-election litigation Trump and his allies filed to try to get some ballots tossed out. Many of those lawsuits targeted election changes intended to make voting easier in Democrat-run cities. That included a Pennsylvania law the state’s Republican-led legislature passed before the pandemic to make absentee ballots available to all registered voters upon request.

Government and election officials repeatedly have described the election as the most secure in U.S. history. Even former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, a Trump ally, said before leaving his post, there was no evidence of widespread fraud that would overturn the result.

“The strategy of lying about voter fraud, delegitimizing the election outcome, and trying to suppress votes has been unmasked for the illegitimate attack on our democracy that it is, and I think that it opens a lot more doors to real conversations about how to fix our voting system and root out this cancer,” said Wendy Weiser, head of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy institute.

Along with the election reform bill, the House two years ago introduced a related bill, now known as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in honor of the late civil rights activist and congressman. House Democrats are expected to reintroduce it soon after it had similarly stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate.

That bill would restore a key provision of the Voting Rights Act that had triggered federal scrutiny of election changes in certain states and counties. A 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling set aside the method used to identify jurisdictions subject to the provision, known as preclearance, which was used to protect voting rights in places with a history of discrimination.

In general, state election officials have been wary of federal voting requirements. But those serving in states led by Democrats have been more open and want to ensure Congress provides money to help them make system upgrades, which the bill does.

“If you still believe in what we all learned in high school government class, that democracy works best when as many eligible people participate, these are commonsense reforms,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., who oversaw California’s elections before being appointed to the seat formerly held by Vice President Kamala Harris.

But Republican officials like Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill remain opposed. Merrill said the federal government’s role is limited and states must be allowed to innovate and implement their own voting rules.

“Those decisions are best left up to the states, and I think the states are the ones that should determine what course of action they should take,” Merrill said, noting Alabama has increased voter registration and participation without implementing early voting.

“To just say that everything needs to be uniform, that’s not the United States of America,” Merrill said.

In the Senate, a key question will be whether there is enough Republican support for elements of the voting reform bill to persuade Democrats to break off certain parts of it into smaller legislation. For now, Democrats say they want a floor vote on the full package.

Edward B. Foley, an election law expert at Ohio State University, said Democrats should consider narrow reforms that could gain bipartisan support, cautioning, moving too quickly on a broad bill runs the risk of putting off Republicans.

“It would seem to me at this moment in American history, a precarious moment, the right instinct should be a kind of bipartisanship to rebuild common ground as opposed to ‘Our side won, your side lost and we are off to the races,'” Foley said.

204,205,https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/icon-who-believed-in-pluralism-mamata-banerjee/cid/1804610,"Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s philosophy of inclusiveness, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi completely ignored, was the theme of Mamata Banerjee’s three public addresses in Calcutta on Saturday — at Netaji Bhavan, Shyambazar five-point crossing and near Netaji’s statue on Red Road.

The chief minister’s stress on the icon’s faith on India’s pluralistic culture on his 125th birth anniversary was clearly aimed at countering the BJP’s narrative in the run-up to the Bengal polls.

“Netaji was a firm believer in unity. He always spoke about solidarity among all religions. Just see the composition of the Indian National Army, which had Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and people from all religions. It had people from Gujarat, Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and all across India as he believed that since he was fighting for the country, everyone should be part of the force,” said Mamata while delivering an address at the end of a 7.5km rally that she led on Saturday afternoon.

“The British believed in divide and rule, while Netaji wanted to unite the country,” she added, before announcing that her government would carry on with year-long celebrations and spread his ideals among the young.

The underlying message in her address could not be missed in poll-bound Bengal, where the saffron camp is banking on a polarisation among voters on religious lines to wrest the seat of power.

With inclusiveness on her lips, Mamata tried to send out a message that she was a believer in Netaji’s philosophy while the saffron party’s agenda was that of dividing people.

“What should be the qualities of a leader? That person should be like Netaji, who believed in taking everyone along…. Netaji never said that the country should broken down into pieces...,” said Mamata.

As Bengal nears the polls, an intense battle has broken out between Trinamul and the BJP over appropriating Bengali icons like Netaji, Rabindranath Tagore or Swami Vivekananda.

Mamata announced on Twitter that the state government would build an Indian National Army memorial in Rajarhat and set up a university after Netaji’s name.

Through the day, Mamata rolled out example after another to establish that the BJP was far from Netaji’s principles. After elaborating on Netaji’s inclusiveness different from the saffron camp’s divisive politics, she focused on how Netaji’s idea of governance was different.

“Netaji had envisioned the Planning Commission and the Indian National Army much before Independence…They (the Centre) claim to idolise Netaji but (they) scrapped the Planning Commission and formed NITI Aayog. No harm in setting up NITI Aayog, but why scrap the Planning Commission?” she asked.

Mamata repeatedly said in the past that the BJP government’s decision of disbanding the Planning Commission was part of an agenda to reduce the power of states and an assault on federalism.

Quoting the BJP’s oft repeated slogans, she said, “The attitude needs to be changed… One leader, one nation, one ration card, ... One political party, one nation. Why this?”

Giving a new dimension to her federalism argument, she questioned why India should have only one capital in Delhi and suggested there be four rotating capitals in different parts of the country.

“Why shouldn’t Calcutta be the capital of the country, I am saying this because of our contribution to the freedom struggle... I will again urge the Centre that India should have four capitals, one in south, one in north, one in east and in northeastern,” the chief minister said.

The BJP state leaders were quick to rubbish the demand as “absurd”, but Trinamul insiders said they would keep repeating the demand in the run up to the polls to strike a chord with voters in Bengal.

Mamata also explained why her government celebrated Netaji’s birth anniversary as Deshnayak Dibos while the Centre celebrated the day as Parakram (valour) Diwas. “Rabindranath Tagore was the first to bestow the title of Deshnayak (national hero) on Netaji...,” Mamata said at Netaji Bhavan.",Icon who believed in pluralism: Mamata,www.telegraphindia.com

The physicians’ creed could equally apply to federal appointments. Which brings us to the habit among recent prime ministers of appointing governors general based on celebrity rather than suitability. You might argue that’s a step forward from the days of purely patronage appointments. After all, Adrienne Clarkson has warmth, wit and charisma, and these traits served her well as governor general. But her appointment was mostly a sort of intellectual fashion statement by the Chretien government: a famous woman, born in Hong Kong, whose husband was an admired public intellectual. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Clarkson was succeeded by the Martin government’s equally dynamic Michaelle Jean, a Haitian-born, top francophone broadcaster, married to a famous film-maker – and a Quebecker to boot. Even if these charismatic women weren’t constitutional brainiacs, at least they brought humanity to Rideau Hall. Meanwhile, Stephen Harper’s blander choice, the affable David Johnston, was a model of both intellectual expertise and decorum.

Enamoured of flashy appointments, however, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau chose poorly: the socially maladroit Julie Payette. The specific reasons for Payette’s resignation – that is, the detailed allegations of workplace abuse in the full report by independent consulting firm Quintet – are not public, the excuse for this being that privacy trumps public interest, even in this case. Withholding the report, however, is an outrageous exercise in secrecy given that its contents led Payette to resign from a job that is fundamental to the smooth functioning of our Westminster system. Or is it? What does it say about the position of governor general in modern times that prime ministers feel they can treat it like a shiny bauble to wave aloft, casting about for celebrities to fill the post rather than treating it as vital to a stable parliamentary democracy? On Friday, Justin Trudeau grudgingly said he would examine whether the selection process for governor general could be “strengthened.” If the job truly is important, he must do so, with full transparency. He might start with the Harper model, an expert committee whose permanent members are selected by the secretary to the Queen in Canada. He could make a cosmetic change or two and claim it’s his idea, while ensuring the resulting recommendations are properly vetted. Perhaps the final candidate for the job will not be a dazzling star in the cool-kids firmament. But at least our next governor general will do no harm. More On This Topic

206,207,https://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/national-news/19034217.2-600-arrested-protesters-across-russia-demand-navalnys-release/,"More than 2,600 people have been arrested after protests erupted in at least 60 Russian cities to demand the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin’s most prominent foe.

The protests, which took place in temperatures as low as minus 50C in some place, highlighted how Navalny’s influence stretches far beyond the political and cultural centres of Moscow and St Petersburg.

In Moscow, an estimated 15,000 protesters gathered in and around Pushkin Square in the city centre, where clashes with police broke out and demonstrators were dragged off by riot officers to police buses and detention trucks. Some activists were beaten with police batons.

Navalny’s wife Yulia was among those arrested.

Police eventually pushed demonstrators out of the square. Thousands then regrouped along a wide boulevard about half a mile away, many of them throwing snowballs at the police before dispersing.

Some demonstrators later went to protest near the jail where Navalny is being held. Police made an undetermined number of arrests there.

The protests stretched across Russia’s vast territory, from the island city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk north of Japan and the eastern Siberian city of Yakutsk, where temperatures plunged to minus 50C, to the more populous European cities.

The range demonstrated how Navalny and his anti-corruption campaign have built an extensive network of support despite official government repression and being routinely ignored by state media.

The OVD-Info group, which monitors political arrests, said at least 1,045 people were detained in Moscow and more than 375 at another large demonstration in St Petersburg.

Overall, it said 2,662 people had been arrested in some 90 cities, revising the count downward from its earlier report of 3,445. The group, which conducts its count through regional associates and runs a hotline for information, did not give an explanation for its revision, and Russian police did not provide arrest figures.

Undeterred, Navalny’s supporters have called for fresh protests next weekend.

Navalny was arrested on January 17 when he returned to Moscow from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a severe nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin, and which Russian authorities deny.

Authorities say his stay in Germany violated terms of a suspended sentence in a 2014 criminal conviction, while Navalny says the conviction was for made-up charges.

The 44-year-old activist is well known nationally for his reports on the corruption that has flourished under President Vladimir Putin’s government.

His wide support puts the Kremlin in a strategic bind — risking more protests and criticism from the West if it keeps him in custody, but apparently unwilling to back down by letting him go free.

In a statement, the US state department condemned “the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists this weekend in cities throughout Russia” and called on Russian authorities to immediately release Navalny and all those detained at protests.

Navalny faces a court hearing in early February to determine whether his sentence in the criminal case for fraud and money-laundering – which Navalny says was politically motivated – is converted to three and a half years behind bars.

On Thursday, Moscow police arrested three top Navalny associates, two of whom were later jailed for periods of nine and 10 days.

Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on August 20.

He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.

Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning.

Russia refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned.

Last month, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up.

The FSB dismissed the recording as fake.

Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side for a decade, unusually durable in an opposition movement often demoralised by repressions.

He has been jailed repeatedly in connection with protests and twice was convicted of financial misdeeds in cases that he said were politically motivated.

He suffered significant eye damage when an assailant threw disinfectant into his face. He was taken from jail to a hospital in 2019 with an illness that authorities said was an allergic reaction but which many suspected was a poisoning.","More than 2,600 arrested as protesters across Russia demand Navalny’s release",www.guardian-series.co.uk

The pilgrims present there from different parts of the country and abroad were happy to see him as a devotee, and they expressed it with chants of “Jo bole so nihal...” Kumar, on his part, did his best to abide by the customs and partook of food at the langar (community dining) at the gurudwara. After he left, several senior Sikh leaders from Delhi and Punjab asserted that Bihar’s chief minister has become the cynosure of the eyes of all Sikh people across the globe by the way he fabulously organized the 350th birth anniversary of the guru in 2017. One of the religious leaders went a step further to say that the event had made Kumar more popular than the prime minister, Narendra Modi, among Sikhs. “If he becomes the prime-ministerial candidate and contests the Lok Sabha elections from anywhere in Punjab, he will win hands down. He must give it a thought,” the Sikh leader confided, as others nodded in unison. Of course, good deeds last long.

The steady rise of the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, seems to have generated anxiety in a section of the current regime. They fear that the saffron-robed monk could emerge as the top choice to succeed Narendra Modi. In the Hindutva brigade, he is already a favourite. In election-bound states, Adityanath is the most sought-after campaigner, drawing large crowds. Recently, he even executed a law against inter-religious marriages, known popularly as the ‘love jihad’ law, that many other states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party are implementing. But the confirmation by the Central Bureau of Investigation of the gang rape and murder of the Hathras victim has come as a big setback for the government, as the state police had claimed that no rape had taken place. In the power corridors of Delhi, the CBI’s probe report has been seen as a politically-loaded move to cut Adityanath to size. Now it is no secret under whose control the premier investigating agency functions.

How difficult is it to reform the Bihar police? The chief minister, Nitish Kumar, has learnt it the hard way. With the state slipping down the dark alleys of crime and the police failing miserably in checking it, mediapersons reportedly found the men in khaki, including the director general of police, SK Singhal, avoiding them by not even taking their phone calls. They complained about it to Kumar, who promptly spoke to Singhal and asked him to respond to their calls. Soon, the government also issued a notification giving out the landline and mobile numbers on which the DGP could be contacted. But what happened next came as a shock. Those who called the mobile number reportedly found out that a stenographer was receiving the calls and he would neither give the message to the police chief nor would there be any call back. Some of the callers gave the stenographer a piece of their mind about how the DGP was a public servant and not a feudal lord in some medieval state. A few people also apprised the chief minister of the situation, but nothing changed. A top politician pointed out, if the chief minister cannot reform the DGP, how could he be expected to improve the law-and-order situation in the state? Meanwhile, Singhal got confirmed for a two-year stint as the DGP after receiving the nod from the Union Public Service Commission. But the state continues to earn infamy over increasing crime and brazen criminals.

The chief minister of Chhattisgarh, Bhupesh Baghel, did make an impression during his first visit to Assam as one of the senior observers tasked by the Congress leadership to manage and coordinate the state assembly elections to be held in April-May. The arrival of the man who had delivered Chhattisgarh to the Congress in 2018 saw the announcement of the much-awaited grand alliance of six parties, including the All India United Democratic Front, against the ruling BJP. But party insiders were most impressed by his frontal attack on the ruling dispensation, something they felt was necessary for the challenging electoral battle ahead. In his short but pointed speeches, one of which was made during the announcement of the grand alliance, he tried to turn the tables on the BJP’s ‘what-did-the-Congress-do-in-60-years’ narrative by reportedly asserting that whatever the BJP-led Centre is ‘selling’ today, from airports to railway stations, was built during the Congress regime, not by the relatives of the BJP leaders. Baghel also marketed the Chhattisgarh model of development, claiming that it was better than the Gujarat model promoted by the BJP. Baghel has made a good start, senior Congressmen said, but impressing the electorate, keeping the faction-ridden state unit together and coming up with a solid narrative to counter the BJP will surely be a different ball game.

Dravidian politics has always had an impact in Karnataka and not just because of shared borders, culture and cuisine. Dravidian political parties have often tested waters in Karnataka which has a significant Tamil-speaking population. Now that VK Sasikala, a close associate of former chief minister, J Jayalalithaa, is ready to walk out of Bangalore jail after her four-year prison term in a disproportionate assets case, even commoners in the BJP-ruled Karnataka are closely watching her move. While she cannot contest in elections for six years, she would certainly play a vital role with her breakaway Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam. With Rajinikanth dropping his political entry, the BJP is reportedly trying to forge an alliance with her party to lure her supporters in Karnataka.

The chief minister of Karnataka, BS Yediyurappa, and the Union home minister, Amit Shah, were found to admire one another during the latter’s recent visit to the state. The Lingayat strongman likened Shah to no less a person than Vallabhbhai Patel. Shah returned the compliment by affirming Yediyurappa’s leadership. Patting each other’s backs has had an immediate effect in silencing those trying to replace the septuagenarian with a Hindutva hard-liner.",How Nitish Kumar won over Sikhs and Delhi cut Yogi to size,www.telegraphindia.com
208,209,https://www.kgoradio.com/news/democrats-working-on-legislation-to-provide-3000-payments-per-child-amid-pandemic/,"House Democrats are working on legislation proposed by President Joe Biden to expand the existing child tax credit, directing the IRS to send recurring monthly payments to American families, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN.

In one draft of the proposal, the IRS would deposit checks worth $300 every month per child younger than 6 and $250 every month per child age 6 to 17. This would give parents $3,000 per year for each child between the ages of 6 to 17, and $3,600 per child under age 6.

The source also confirmed to CNN that House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal of Massachusetts is directly involved in the effort to write the expansion of the child tax credit, as well as House Appropriations Committee Chair Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.

The drafting of the proposed legislation was first reported by The Washington Post.

Eligibility for the benefit, similar to the stimulus checks, would be based on family income for the prior tax year and be phased out at a certain income amount, the Post reported. Under the draft legislation, families would be eligible for the full monthly benefits even if they owe more in taxes than the credit value, according to the newspaper.

A White House official didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.

Biden has previously said he wants to expand the child tax credit and last week he unveiled a $1.9 trillion proposal that would do so for one year. He also called for making it fully refundable to allow more households to claim it. Currently, 27 million children live in low-income families who receive a partial or no tax credit because they earn too little, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

A one-year expansion would cost about $120 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan fiscal watchdog.

The President’s proposal also includes an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit to more low-income workers, along with $1,400 stimulus checks, increased unemployment, nutrition and housing aid, among other measures.

“All told, the American Rescue Plan would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half. That’s 5 million children lifted out of poverty,” Biden said Friday before signing two executive orders that would augment nutrition assistance and strengthen federal worker protections.

Biden also noted that the proposal would reduce poverty among Black families by one third and among Hispanic households by almost 40%.

The American Rescue Plan would augment many of the measures in Congress’ historic $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill from March and in the $900 billion legislation from December, which was scaled back to garner support from Senate Republicans.

CNN has reported that Biden’s stimulus proposal already faces Republican objections, and Senate Democrats have been laying the groundwork to use a rare procedural tactic known as reconciliation to pass major parts of the package if Republicans stall their efforts.

The White House has urged patience when it comes to negotiating and passing the stimulus plan on a bipartisan basis through the regular Senate process, but Biden’s team has said they aren’t willing to “take any tools off the table.”

The current child tax credit provides up to $2,000 per child under the age of 17. The credit phases out for single parents with a modified adjusted gross income over $200,000, and $400,000 for married couples.

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act broadened eligibility to many more upper-middle-income households, increased the size of the credit for many families and the amount that is refundable. The changes were pushed by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.

More than 48 million households are expected to claim the child tax credit for 2020, according to Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation.

“There is an ongoing research on whether India would have gained independence sooner or later had Netaji been alive… I think in the current situation, instead of going into these complexities, what will be more important is if we could nurture Netaji’s values of courage, honesty and patriotism and take India ahead,” said Swami Sarvalokananda.

Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya organised the programme that was streamed on the school’s YouTube channel on Saturday evening.

On Netaji’s birthday, one should not stop by only garlanding him and expressing respect for some time. “That is not how it should be... Given our country’s situation, it has been noticed that patriotism has sunk to the bottom... We have forgotten to love our country… and whatever unpleasant is happening is primarily because we have forgotten to respect our motherland,” Swami Sarvalokananda said.

He said that Netaji had got his values of patriotism from Swami Vivekananda.

Swami Sarvalokananda later told Metro that “there is a difference in the brand of politics that Netaji practised and that of today’s”.

“During Netaji’s time the country came before self,” he said.

The one-and-half-hour programme included songs, recitation, speeches and episodes from Netaji’s life by students of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya.

Alapan Bandyopadhyay, Bengal’s chief secretary, and Jayanta Ghoshal, the state government’s information and development officer, were the keynote speakers.

“To celebrate this day despite it being an online programme we wanted to engage students and not just today, we will have celebrations round the year. The students need to imbibe the values that Netaji stood for,” said Brahmachari Turiyachaitanya, the headmaster of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya.",Ramakrishna Mission online programme to celebrate patriot,www.telegraphindia.com

""I condemn the 1938 racial laws, all of whose weight I still feel on my shoulders to this day, and with me the whole royal house,"" 48-year-old Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy said of his great-grandfather.

Victor Emmanuel III had put his signature to an ""unacceptable document"", he added in a letter posted to Facebook, ""officially apologising"" in the name of his family.

Almost 8,000 Italian Jews were deported from the country and murdered in Nazi extermination camps, most of them in Auschwitz.

Giving a TV interview alongside the letter, Emanuele Filiberto also vaunted his family's positive role in Italian unification and granting of equal rights to Jews from 1848.

Several Italian royals were themselves deported to Nazi concentration camps, he recalled.

After the war, Victor Emmanuel III abdicated in May 1946 and died the following year in Egypt.

His son Humbert II reigned for only a month before leaving for Switzerland when Italians opted for a republican constitution in a referendum.

Parliament only ended a constitutional ban on the House of Savoy's male heirs returning to Italy in 2002, after Emanuele Filiberto and his father Vittorio Emanuele swore loyalty to the republic.

When Michael Dargie’s girlfriend tested positive for COVID-19, the Calgary artist followed all protocol, getting a test for the virus and staying at his studio to aid his partner in isolating.

Doctors say education needed as one-in-five Albertans plan to shun vaccine Doctors say the province should be reaching out to the vaccine-hesitant after a recent poll showed one-fifth of Albertans have no intention of being vaccinated against COVID-19.

Leger, the largest Canadian-owned polling firm, conducted a survey of 1,516 Canadians between Jan. 15 to 17. Nationally, the survey showed 71 per cent of respondents plan to get a COVID-19 vaccine jab. In Alberta, it dipped to 65 per cent — the lowest in Canada compared to other provinces — with 20 per cent of respondents from the province indicating they have “no” intention to get immunized and 15 per cent who are unsure. As Alberta’s COVID-19 vaccinations stall due to lack of supply, some are frustrated by a lack of clarity over when it will be their turn to get the jab. The discontent comes as Alberta reports the deaths of two Calgary-area young adults from the virus, including a 20-year-old, the pandemic’s youngest victim in Alberta to date. Mark Drury is co-owner of the Comfort Keepers Calgary private home-care company, which provides care for individuals in need of companionship or personal care.

The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit said genome sequencing on six COVID-19 samples from Roberta Place Retirement Lodge have been identified as the highly contagious B117 variant. Officials with the local health unit announced earlier this week that they had found a variant at the home north of Toronto and conducted tests to determine what it was. Known variant strains of the virus were first detected in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte lashed out at suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines on Saturday, saying delays in deliveries amounted to a serious breach of contractual obligations.

He was just stood looking spaced out. It was sick.“The vet found so many injuries that I can’t even begin to list them.”As with the attack on 70-year-old Raymond Skelly’s Yorkshire terrier Suzy in the town centre on January 4, Jayne said the Akita made a beeline for her dog without warning.Tim recalls a strange moment before the attack when the owner seemingly bent down to, he thinks, either take off the dog’s lead or give it an order.The couple said the owner was known to them beforehand as someone to be wary of, and had reportedly only got the dog recently.“Police said it was an unfortunate accident,” said Jayne. But it’s the same scenario with a different dog.“Over a year ago, someone warned me about this man.“It seems like someone is training these big dogs to attack smaller dogs for some reason. My husband saw the man bend down to the dog, before it rushed straight across the road and leapt on top of my dog and crushed him to death. It’s almost like he said something to it, as there was nothing to say it was going to attack our dog before that.“This man went out purposefully with a lethal weapon, without a harness, without a muzzle, just on a slip lead.“That dog has been trained to attack small animals.

219,220,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/california/story/2021-01-23/californias-ban-on-indoor-worship-upheld-by-appeals-court,"A federal appeals court has denied a Southern California church’s request to overturn the state’s coronavirus restrictions barring worship services indoors during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a newspaper report Saturday.

The Sacramento Bee said Friday’s ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals leaves the door open for addressing Gov. Gavin Newsom administration’s limits on church attendance if a California county is in a less-restrictive COVID-19 tier.

A three-judge panel ruled against South Bay United Pentecostal Church of Chula Vista over public health orders that restrict religious services from being held inside while virus case rates and hospitalizations remain high.

While the panel agreed the San Diego-area church is suffering “irreparable harm,” the judges believed California’s rules to curb the spread of the virus did not violate First Amendment rights, the Bee reported.

The judges said the ban on indoor service is directly tied to the state’s effects to curb the spread of COVID-19, which has killed 36,000 Californians and infected more than 3 million.

Newsom and the state have faced multiple lawsuits over restrictions on gatherings, church services, restaurant dining and other limits on activities aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.

“We are mindful that ‘even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten,’” Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw wrote in the court’s opinion. “But we do not think this is what California has done.”

South Bay had appealed the original denial by U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant twice and were denied an emergency injunction from the U.S. Supreme Court in May.

The court’s 50-page ruling was skeptical of Newsom’s attendance limits during worship services, suggesting those rules could be struck down, the Bee said.

The panel said it believed the church could succeed in its claim that the state’s 100- and 200-person attendance caps were unconstitutional.

The judges sent the matter back to the lower court to consider the attendance caps.

Currently in California, indoor worship services are banned in all purple-tiered counties — those deemed to be at widespread risk of coronavirus transmission. This tier accounts for the vast majority of the state. Just four counties are in less-restrictive tiers.",California’s ban on indoor worship upheld by appeals court,www.sandiegouniontribune.com

The former couple’s second breakup comes after more than three years of marriage.

Moore married Daly in June 2017 and gave birth to their daughter, Brooklyn, in November 2018. On Saturday, Daly released a statement to The Root confirming their breakup.

Although Moore hasn’t addressed the split, hours after Daly’s announcement, she took to her Instagram Story to share a photo of two people in a pool looking out at the ocean.

“Thank you God for you [sic] favoring and abundant blessing,” she wrote along with the hashtag “peace.”

In his statement, Daly revealed he and Moore tried to work on their marriage but ultimately decided to go their separate ways.

“After recently attending mediation, Kenya and I have agreed to end our marriage. I will always have great care for her and look forward to amicably continuing to co-parent our daughter Brooklyn with an abundance of love and wisdom,” he said in the statement.

Looking to the future, Daly plans to also help people of color in Brooklyn amid the coronavirus pandemic. The restaurateur owns the eatery Soco, which is located in the same borough.

“This focus will take shape through using my restaurant as a ‘Community Hub’ where positive and diverse perspectives on important topics such as economic empowerment, social activism, and political engagement can be highlighted in a safe and productive forum,” he said.

“I’m blessed to be a positive change agent for not just my family but also my community.”

Moore and Daly’s crumbling marriage was documented on “RHOA.” Although the former couple initially split in September 2019, neither party took legal steps to divorce the other.

Instead, they began attending marriage counseling. During “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” Season 12 virtual reunion, Moore revealed she and her husband were working to save their marriage. “We’re in counseling and Marc has made a complete 360,” she explained.

“He just seems like he’s fighting for his family, and that’s all I ever wanted him to do. I had blocked him, and then he started to ask to speak with me and send me emails and just become more humble in the relationship, and he just basically said he really wants to work on it.”

223,224,https://www.cravenherald.co.uk/news/national/19034531.boris-johnson-first-call-new-us-president-joe-biden/,"Boris Johnson has had his first call with Joe Biden since the new US president entered the White House on Wednesday.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister congratulated Mr Biden on his inauguration, and warmly welcomed his decision to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change and the World Health Organisation – both abandoned by Donald Trump.

Following the call, Mr Johnson tweeted: “Great to speak to President Joe Biden this evening.

“I look forward to deepening the long-standing alliance between our two countries as we drive a green and sustainable recovery from Covid19.”

A No 10 spokesman said they had also discussed the potential benefits of a free trade deal, with the Prime Minister reiterating his intention to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible.

“The Prime Minister praised President Biden’s early action on tackling climate change and commitment to reach net zero by 2050,” the spokesman said.

“Building on the UK and US’ long history of cooperation in security and defence, the leaders re-committed to the NATO alliance and our shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy.

“The leaders looked forward to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow, and to working together through the G7, G20 and Cop26 this year.”

It is reported that Mr Johnson is the first European leader to have spoken to the new president, after he had calls on Friday with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

There will be some relief in Downing Street at the early call amid concerns about the way Mr Johnson’s perceived closeness to Mr Trump would be seen by the new administration.

The Prime Minister is regarded with deep suspicion by some senior Democrats around Mr Biden who – unlike the former president – was no fan of Brexit.

Many were offended by his sideswipe at the “part-Kenyan” Barack Obama during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, while Mr Biden once described him as a “physical and emotional clone” of Mr Trump.

Following the inauguration, No 10 sought to play down Mr Biden’s decision to remove a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office – even though Mr Johnson had criticised Mr Obama when he did the same thing.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The Oval Office is the president’s private office and it’s up to the president to decorate it as he wishes.

Trump this month became the first U.S. president to be impeached twice after the Democratic-controlled House, with the support of 10 Republicans, voted to charge him with incitement of insurrection for a fiery Jan. 6 speech to his followers before they launched a deadly assault on the Capitol.

After a brief moment of bipartisan sentiment in which members from both parties condemned the unprecedented attack on Congress as it met to formalize President Joe Biden's victory, a number of Senate Republicans are opposing Trump's trial, which could lead to a vote blocking him from future office.

""If it is a good idea to impeach and try former Presidents, what about former Democratic Presidents when Republicans get the majority in 2022? Think about it and let's do what is best for the country,"" Senator John Cornyn, a 19-year veteran of the Senate, said in a tweet directed at Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that the mob was ""provoked"" by Trump. But other Senate Republicans claim that trying Trump while out of office would be unconstitutional and further divide the country.

There are also concerns on both sides of the aisle that the trial could distract from President Joe Biden's legislative agenda.

228,229,https://www.kgoradio.com/news/the-man-third-in-the-line-of-presidential-succession-has-been-in-five-batman-movies/,"For as many foes as the superhero fends off, Batman has a formidable team of supporters starting with his sidekick Robin, Gotham City Commissioner James Gordon and his ever-loyal butler, Alfred Pennyworth.

But one of the Caped Crusader’s most fervent supporters lies not in a comic book, but in the US Senate, and he’s known the Bat for more than 80 years.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont and the longest-serving member of the current Senate, is a Batman aficionado who’s turned his fandom into philanthropy. He’s even used the comics to forward his legislative agenda.

Now President pro tempore of the Senate, Leahy is third in the presidential line of succession. Though it’s unlikely he’ll ever have to serve as President, his high-profile position shines a brighter light on his colorful resume — which includes multiple appearances in the “Batman” films.

When he’s not working in the Senate chambers in Washington, Leahy retreats to Gotham, where Batman fights cartoonish villains and mans the Batmobile. It’s a comfort he took up when he was 4 years old.

“If you live in the real world all the time, it can be kind of boring,” the senator told Vermont alt-weekly newspaper Seven Days in 2008.

Leahy declined an interview for this story through his spokesman, but his affinity for all things Batman is well-documented. As he wrote in the foreword of “Detective Comics: 80 Years of Batman,” he was born just one year after Batman’s first comic published in 1939.

He first discovered Batman at age 4, when he received his first library card. He frequented the Kellogg-Hubbard Library in Montpelier, where he spent many an afternoon poring over comics. While his school friends raved over Superman, Leahy found a “kindred bond” with the Bat.

“Entering Batman’s world through my imagination opened an early door into a lifelong love of reading,” he wrote in his foreword.

He’d continue spending hours at the library each day until adulthood, and even after he moved to Washington, he’d make time to pop in. He’s a vocal advocate for literacy and the preservation of libraries so children can have similarly formative experiences with books.

“Some of my fondest memories as a child were at the library, where everyone fit in and possibilities were limitless,” he writes on his Senate website.

Leahy was elected to the Senate in 1974 and until the mid-1990s, his affinity for Batman didn’t have much to do with his duties on Capitol Hill.

That changed in 1996, when Leahy collaborated with DC Comics to create “Batman: Death of Innocents: The Horror of Landmines,” a graphic novel warning of the dangers of landmines. Leahy has long advocated to end the use of landmines, and he told the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call that he placed copies of the comic on every senator’s desk that year.

Leahy’s first foray into screen acting — something he does strictly when Batman is involved — came in 1995, when he appeared in the critically reviled “Batman Forever.” The same year, he voiced a character billed as “Territorial Governor” in “Batman: The Animated Series.”

Since then, Leahy has appeared in nearly as many “Batman” films as the Caped Crusader himself. He usually appears as a scowling politician (though in “Batman & Robin,” which his son Mark also had a cameo in, he was allowed to enjoy a raucous party). He even met an explosive end as the curiously named Senator Purrington in “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.”

“I explain to everybody that getting blown up was OK ’cause my wife’s a registered nurse,” he joked to Roll Call in 2016. “She put me back together and I never missed a vote.”

His most notable cameo, though, came in 2008’s “The Dark Knight,” when he confronts Heath Ledger’s Joker and famously tells the villain that he’s “not intimidated by thugs.” The Joker, true to form, responds by grabbing Leahy’s character and menacing him with a knife.

Ledger, who died before the film’s release, is Leahy’s favorite Joker.

“He scared the heck out of me, when he came at me with the knife,” he told Roll Call. “I didn’t have to act.”

He’ll be absent from the upcoming reboot “The Batman,” starring Robert Pattinson in the titular role. Citing a busy schedule, he told the Burlington Free Press he “didn’t even seek to be in it.”

“I have too many other things going on with Covid, with appropriation bills,” he told the paper in August.

While his film roles have certainly satisfied his inner fanboy, Leahy does it for the library where his love for reading bloomed. He donates every fee from his appearances and royalty checks from residual showings to his beloved Kellogg-Hubbard Library, where he helped finance a children’s wing named for him. From his roles in “The Dark Knight” trilogy alone, Leahy has donated more than $150,000 back to his hometown library, said Carolyn Brennan, co-director of the library.

In 2012, the library hung a plaque honoring Leahy, who staff called their “super hero.”

Leahy found Batman when he was a boy, but his love for the fictional hero is foundational to who he is and the lawmaker he became. Batman instilled in Leahy a love of reading and promoting literacy and of delivering justice (though as a government servant, not a caped vigilante).

Leahy preferred Batman to other characters because, unlike the god-like Superman or the super-powered Spider-Man, Batman was just a man, albeit an extremely rich one, with “human strengths and human frailties.” The danger Batman faced was different than that of other heroes — his felt real, Leahy wrote in the DC collection foreword.

“The Batman prevailed through superior intellect and detective skills, through the freedoms afforded by great wealth and through sheer will,” Leahy wrote in his foreword. “Not superpowers, but skill, science and rationality.”

Much like Bruce Wayne, Leahy is just a man, albeit one with more power than most and the chance to make real, tangible changes in his own Gotham. Following Batman’s example, he’s vowed to use that power wisely.",The man third in the line of presidential succession has been in five 'Batman' movies,www.kgoradio.com
229,230,https://www.observertoday.com/news/2021/01/bill-is-introduced-to-stabilize-food-supply-chain-in-the-state/,"With the pandemic creating levels of food insecurity not seen since the Great Recession, state Senator George Borrello, R-Sunset Bay, and Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz, D-Queens, have joined forces on a measure that would establish a permanent program for distributing surplus agricultural products to food banks, similar to the Nourish New York model.

The Nourish New York initiative was launched in April 2020, in response to the surge of people in need at food banks across the state, as well as the hardships facing farmers affected by supply chain disruptions. With an initial $25 million in state funding, the program directed the purchase of food and products from upstate farms and food producers for distribution to food banks across the state. Another $10 million was allocated to the program in late October to sustain the program through the end of the year. One such beneficiary of the program, an interfaith human service agency named Chautauqua Rural Ministry, reported that their organization alone served approximately 4,000 meals weekly using agricultural products through the Nourish New York program.

“The COVID-19 crisis has reminded us that many families are just a paycheck or two away from food insecurity. Data indicates that since the pandemic, approximately one in ten state residents have become food insecure, with a quarter of those reporting this was a new problem for their households,” Borrello said. “The economic recovery for many of these struggling New Yorkers will extend beyond the pandemic, which is why it is critical that we commit now, to permanently establish and expand through legislation, food relief programs like Nourish New York, which benefit both our farmers and those in need. One of my starkest memories from earlier in the pandemic was footage of despondent farmers dumping milk and leaving crops unharvested in their fields, as desperate New Yorkers waited in lines for hours at food pantries. We need to ensure that doesn’t happen again and this bill is the first step forward.”

The legislators announced the bipartisan initiative today in Corona, Queens, after volunteering at a weekly food distribution site, sponsored by community organizations La Jornada and the Queens Museum. Since last June, the organizations have paired up to serve up to 1,000 families every Wednesday, distributing fresh and nonperishable food items. La Jornada, which has been supported by Nourish New York and other federal funding sources, recently received notice their USDA grant would be discontinued. The news has caused great uncertainty as to how the organization will address the needs of the thousands of families they support in the area.

“As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, nonprofits and government entities alike have been left scrambling for resources to ensure that the basic needs of our constituents are met. At the height of the pandemic, food lines stretched for miles with no end in sight and without a permanent or sustainable product source. As the crisis continues and food insecurity becomes more severe, this bill aims to provide a state pipeline to put food on the table to those who need it most. While the districts that Senator Borrello and I represent are hundreds of miles apart, our constituents share commonality in their dependence on each other for survival,” Cruz said.

The legislation directs the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets to provide financial and technical support for the development of a permanent initiative to provide surplus New York agricultural products to communities in need. This distribution will be effectuated through a network of food banks and other emergency food providers statewide. The measure envisions an expansion of the current, pandemic-specific program and would also complement related efforts, such as the Farm-to-School program.

“While hunger has been a longstanding problem in Western New York, the COVID-19 crisis has greatly exacerbated the need for food assistance in our community. Currently as many as one in six people in FeedMore WNY’s four-county service area may be struggling with hunger due to the pandemic,” said Tara A. Ellis, president and CEO of FeedMore WNY. “Initiatives such as the Nourish New York Program have been a lifeline for local farmers and producers as well as for hunger-relief organizations and the community members we serve. Through Nourish NY, FeedMore WNY was able to procure nearly 1.3 million pounds of nutritious food for distribution to our neighbors in need. We are grateful to Senator George Borrello and Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz for their commitment to fighting food insecurity through this critical legislation.”",Bill is introduced to stabilize food supply chain in the state,www.observertoday.com

What appears to be a mass logout caused users to receive a message forcing them into a log out and log back in situation. Users were abruptly logged out and then met with a ""session expired"" message before being prompted to log back in.

It looks like the mass logout happened around 10:30 p.m. ET, but some, including me, noted the problem closer to 9:40pm. The website Downdetector.com, that monitors technical interruptions, noted a spike in reported Facebook problems between the 9:00pm and 10:30pm time frame.

Twitter lit up with chatter about the incident and why it happened. Some thought major cyber attack, and others just a hack. Some even voiced that it was a way for Facebook to start tracking their users. (gotta love those vibes, right?). As of right now nobody is really sure at this time what exactly happened.

According to Deadline, Facebook did release a statement addressing the mass log out saying,

‘We’re looking into reports that some people are currently having to login again to access their Facebook accounts,’ the company said in a statement. ‘We believe this was due to a configuration change and we’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible.’

Whatever the cause, things are back up and running normal and users will most likely spend the day complaining on Facebook about the mass log out.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Wednesday asked Tesla to recall 158,000 Model S and Model X vehicles over media control unit (MCU) failures that could pose safety risks by leading to touchscreen displays not working.

A KBA spokesman told Bild am Sonntag newspaper that German authorities were in contact with the NHTSA and that the KBA had launched its own investigation.

“The result of the review is still pending,” the spokesman added.

The U.S. auto safety agency made the unusual request in a formal letter to Tesla after upgrading a safety probe in November, saying it had tentatively concluded the 2012-2018 Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles contain a defect related to motor vehicle safety.

Depending on the outlet, the goal is too ambitious, or too modest, or doable but difficult, or already stirring disagreements within Biden’s pandemic response team.

Only one thing is indisputable: Time will tell. April 30 will mark 100 days since Biden was inaugurated, but well before that, it should be clear whether the new administration is on track to fix the chaotic, lagging vaccination rollout it inherited.

Even if that 100-day goal is achieved, it will be only the beginning. Experts estimate that 60% to 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated to extinguish the spread of the coronavirus. Anthony Fauci, who is being retained by Biden as the government’s top infectious disease adviser, recently raised his estimate to 80% to 90%. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 death toll is 410,000 and counting.

Meanwhile, Zurab Pololikashvili, the secretary general of the United Nations World Tourism Organization, called this week for the global adoption of vaccination passports as part of wider measures he said were essential to get the world in motion once again.

""The rollout of vaccines is a step in the right direction, but the restart of tourism cannot wait,"" he told a meeting of the UNWTO's Global Tourism Crisis Committee in Madrid. ""Vaccines must be part of a wider, coordinated approach that includes certificates and passes for safe cross-border travel.""",Can Biden pull off 100 million doses in 100 days?

We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Sudbury letters: Arena just needs care; Salvation Army grateful; Where are the vaccines? KED report We have a rule on the railroad – “The safest course must be taken.” When something costs a dollar and you only have 50 cents, the answer becomes fairly easy. We don’t live in London, Ont., where they have the most millionaires per capita in Ontario and could spend millions. Their arena is at full capacity at each game and one cannot get a seat in their restaurant (at least before COVID-19). My father also had a saying: “Old shoes are the best to wear, old horses are the best to ride.” I think we have an older arena that needs a little loving care. There already is a Disneyland in Florida; we don’t need another one on the Kingsway. The current number of fans at the NHL games and possibly our Sudbury Wolves games (when they start up) would fit in our Capreol Arena under the present ongoing COVID circumstances.

Lastly, from the outlining areas, we are not very happy with our raise in taxes to support your city core’s dreams. From the corner of Front and Young. With all the doom and gloom of our current news, it is with great pleasure that we can share some good news. The Salvation Army wants to send out a big thank you to the citizens of Greater Sudbury. With the help of dozens of volunteers who gave of their time, and due to the generosity of this wonderful community, we were able to raise $252,710.36 during our Christmas Kettle Campaign of 2020. Special thanks to the Lougheed Foundation for $50,000 and to an anonymous donor for $25,000. Our Christmas hamper program helped 891 families and 1,642 children (including 300 children in care). This enabled the families and children the opportunity for a Christmas dinner and toys, but, more importantly, it showed these families and children that our community cares and values them as fellow citizens. Sudbury has always been generous with their time and money in times of need and this year was no different, so with gratitude to all of you who helped us out, we wish you a happy and healthy New Year. Put your hand up if you actually thought that anyone in northeastern Ontario would get a vaccination against COVID-19 before every man woman and child in southern Ontario.

The next time there is a push by anyone in Northern Ontario to form our own province, you can bring that memory up. In the meantime, we can be warmed by the fact that northeastern Ontario sends $1 billion every year to Toronto (Queen’s Park, the provincial government) in the form of mining royalties. We get to watch southern Ontario being built up with our money, while we cannot even get a four-lane highway. Mayor Brian Bigger, reconsider your direction to staff regarding the Kingsway Entertainment District. Engage an outside accounting firm to do a forensic audit on the KED and all large projects. This could demystify all monies spent and authorized by council to date, plus any ongoing and or projected spending. Once that is completed and presented at a public council meeting, the documents that outline the projects and the agreements engaging the projects can be analyzed in terms of tax dollars spent. This will certainly demystify all elements of these projects and remind council that taxpayers are basically concerned with how their money is being spent over the process documents used to spend their money.",Sudbury letters: Arena just needs care; Salvation Army grateful; Where are the vaccines?

Russia wants to win back Ukraine. And a Ukrainian revolution group is trying to maintain sovereignty at any cost.

So when two countries are fighting each other in a bloody battle, who is going to step in to save the day? Surely, by now, you know the answer.

The US, of course! It does what it does best. Plonks itself right in the middle of this unrest. With platoons in Europe and drone flights operated from the US—it looks at preventing a war-profiteer from getting his hands on nukes. That, in short, is what Outside the Wire all about.

It’s an explosive premise, literally. But the film, in its essence, is anti-war. The narrative comes from the perspectives of a cyborg super-soldier (Anthony Mackie as Captain Leo) and a drone pilot (Damson Idris as Lieutenant Harp).

The latter is sent to work under Leo as a punishment as Harp’s decision to bomb a site results in the death of two marines.

Never mind the fact that his decision saved the lives of 38 other soldiers. He is sent to active war zones, so he can learn the value of every life and the real-life repercussions of battle. Leo has a wicked sense of humour and an acerbic tongue, and the equation between him and Harp is reminiscent of the 2001 classic, Training Day.

In between all this, Harp deals with his inner conflicts about the futilities of war. The conflicted soldier with much conviction acts as the perfect foil to Mackie’s cavalier Captain Leo.

However, their conversations about war and peace get rather tedious at times, with the film too beginning to meander after a point. It is the action sequences featuring Mackie and Idris that keep you hooked. The cyborg’s eagerness and the drone pilot’s hesitation make for tasteful contrast and add a lot of novelty to the well-orchestrated stunts.

Alas, all comes undone in the final stretch. There is a “twist”, rather, a sermon about war, civilian collateral damage, and more. This whole portion feels like an afterthought and sticks out like the many US drones in the clear skies of a war-torn country. The film works so long as the focus is firmly on the action. Soon as it steps away to deliver sermons, it begins to feel jaded and discursive. In summary, it’s another Netflix film that is high on action and boasts a great cast, but as for the substance, you are better off looking elsewhere.","'Outside The Wire' film review: High on action, low on substance",www.newindianexpress.com
239,240,https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/military-veteran-seeks-magic-mushroom-therapy-to-combat-ptsd,"Scott Atkinson says magic mushrooms have already done much to tame the post-traumatic stress demons conjured by two years serving in Afghanistan and Bosnia. But the retired Canadian Armed Forces master corporal said he’s hoping to become the country’s first military veteran to undergo legal, supervised psilocybin therapy. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. 

tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or “I want to live my life not looking over my shoulder, I want to do this working with a doctor, but that’s not readily available,” said Atkinson, 48. Last Tuesday, the resident of Smith Falls, Ont., applied to Canada’s minister of health for an exemption that would allow therapists to treat him based on the currently illegal psychedelic. It’s been granted to several terminally ill Canadians but never to a patient in a non-palliative situation, or a military veteran, said the psychedelic therapy firm assisting him. A University of Alberta psychiatry professor said he’s convinced of the medicinal properties of psilocybin and hopes the federal government grants the exemption, as long as the therapy is conducted properly.

“Of every medication I’ve seen, I have more faith psilocybin will be a breakthrough than any other therapy,” said Dr. Peter Silverstone. He said research into the discipline and interest being shown in the province means the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary could be leaders in unlocking the psychedelic’s potential in treating mental illness. Atkinson, who’s suffered from anxiety, depression, chronic pain and alcoholism after ending his 25-year military career in the Canadian military, said he’d welcome that research. But the ex-soldier said he’s already certain of psilocybin’s merits after his own private use cooled his burning stress. More On This Topic “I’d be in a mall and hear a song and start crying, I’d bang my head on a wall — my anxiety and depression was that bad,” said Atkinson. “With mushrooms, I’m able to be myself with my family and when I’d take breaks from it, my wife says ‘please go back on it,'” he said. Other rehabilitation methods have had limited success, said Atkinson, and pharmaceutical medications have taken a toll. He said medicinal use of cannabis has improved his health by weaning him off alcohol and prescription drugs, and enhancing his sleep. But he said under controlled conditions with psilocybin, his recovery would be enhanced.

“It opens your mind if you’re willing to do it with proper therapy — it can open you up to a new world,” said Atkinson. He said many other veterans grappling with mental illnesses are expressing interest in the treatment, adding he believes magic mushrooms’ wider therapeutic use is all but inevitable. “You look at where cannabis was five years ago and we’re at the exact same spot now,” said Atkinson. The U of A’s Silverstone largely agrees, adding 60 studies of psilocybin’s merits either underway or impending illustrate the momentum behind widening its use — one that was stillborn due to concern over stronger psychedelics. “Fears about LSD put a stop to research into psilocybin. We lost a tool for therapy but I’d say it’s roaring back,” he said. “In the next two years, we’re going to see something really quite remarkable coming out of this.” Psilocybin and other compounds in the mushrooms impact neurotransmitters, primarily serotonin, and have been shown to inhibit conditions like anxiety and depression without the side-effects of more potent psychedelics, he said. For the sake of disclosure, Silverstone said he’s made a financial investment in the field, but insisted that merely shows how confident he is in its eventual acceptance and clinical success. “I have never had any shares in any company before,” he said. “This could also be a huge commercial opportunity for Alberta and it would be a shame if places like B.C. or Ontario beat us to it.”",Military veteran seeks magic mushroom therapy to combat PTSD,calgaryherald.com

Sometime Friday morning, a fisherman was near Black’s Bridge when he found what he thought was military equipment of some sort in the water. Black’s Bridge stretches over Saluda River connecting Saluda and Newberry counties between Saluda and Prosperity, on the west side of Lake Murray.

Officials said the fisherman left whatever was in the water alone and quickly reported it.

Saturday, officials identified the piece of equipment as an 81-millimeter military mortar round by the United States Air Force EOD detachment.

Around 2:00 p.m., after being recovered from the Lake floor, the round was isolated on the shoreline of Lake Murray in Saluda County and detonated without any damage or threat to the community.

Law enforcement is unsure how long the 81-millimeter mortar round was in the lake.

SLED, Saluda Sheriff’s Office, Lexington Sheriff’s Office, Newberry Sheriff’s Office, United States Air Force, and South Carolina Department of Natural Resources were involved in the investigation.

The chip-making plant would employ up to 1,900 people and could open as soon as October 2022, according to the news organization. The site in Genesee County, which wasn't specified, is one of five locations Samsung is scouting for the mega-factory, along with two in and around Phoenix and two others in and around Austin, Texas. The Genesee County site likely refers to the 1,250-acre Western New York Science and Technology Advanced Manufacturing Park, known as STAMP, located in the Town of Alabama and developed by the Genesee County Economic Development Center. Alabama Supervisor Robert Crossen told The Buffalo News late Saturday that he's heard increasing interest in the site from a number of companies for large and smaller-scale developments. He said most such potential developments are cloaked in confidentiality at this stage in the process so he doesn't know if Samsung is, in fact, eyeing the property. But he said he wouldn't be surprised because the federal government has made a push to boost domestic production of semiconductors.

If Samsung builds the plant as described in the Journal, Crossen said, ""It's going to be a huge boost for the entire state."" The STAMP site, under development for nearly 15 years, remains shovel-ready but vacant. A major draw, aside from its proximity to the Thruway, is its access to low-cost power. Crossen can look out his window and see the STAMP property. ""I live right on the edge of it,"" he said. Steve Hyde, president and CEO of the Genesee County Economic Development Center, said in an email Saturday that the agency does not comment publicly about possible developments at the site. He added: ""Development of the (STAMP) site has steadily progressed through the dedicated support of Gov. (Andrew M.) Cuomo, the New York State Legislature, and our municipalities and utility partners. With this support, STAMP has achieved significant site readiness milestones through completion of major site and infrastructure pre-project requirements. These developments, along with our region's abundant talent and low-cost electricity, have enabled increased attractiveness for the large-scale site and utility capacities at STAMP.” Sen. Charles Schumer, in a statement Saturday, promised to give the project a major push: “When I stood at STAMP in August to announce my proposal to create new federal semiconductor manufacturing incentives, I said it could put sites like Western New York’s STAMP in contention for landing a new semiconductor manufacturing plant and the thousands of new jobs that come with it.

“This game-changer proposal passed into law last month and already companies like Samsung are considering STAMP for a 1,900 job chip fab (plant), partly because of this new federal initiative. Now, I will work to secure this federal investment and offer my all-out support and advocacy in helping STAMP compete for this multi-billion dollar plant.” STAMP lost its first major potential tenant, 1366 Technologies, in March 2018 when the solar energy products company announced that it was pulling the plug on a planned factory that would employ up to 1,000 workers making silicon wafers. It opted to build the factory overseas after failing to obtain expected incentives. It's hard to think of another development considered for Western New York of this size and scale. For perspective, Amazon's mega-warehouse planned for a site on Grand Island would have represented a $300 million investment by the company and would have created 1,000 jobs. The e-commerce giant pulled the project after it ran into community opposition.",Report: Genesee County is contender for $17 billion Samsung chip-making plant,buffalonews.com
242,243,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/microsoft-boosts-price-of-xbox-live-gold-sparking-gamer-outrage-1.1552705,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. is raising the price for subscriptions to Xbox Live Gold, its paid online gaming platform, doubling the cost for an annual pass and prompting swift outrage from users.

The price bump brings the cost of a six-month subscription to $60. Last year, Microsoft removed the option for a full-year subscription at that price from the online store. The cost for a monthly subscription also increased, jumping 10% to $11.

The move pushes the price of Xbox Live Gold closer to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, a more expensive subscription that also gives access to games and other perks. At $15 a month, or $180 a year, Game Pass Ultimate is now only $60 more expensive than a year of Xbox Live Gold.

Game Pass has become central to Microsoft’s strategy to attract loyalty with the recent release of the Xbox Series X console. But gamers were outraged that Microsoft would raise the cost of a subscription so drastically, especially during the pandemic, when people have been spending more time on screens than usual and unemployment has risen. Users expressed frustration online, often comparing the subscription cost to Sony Corp.’s PlayStation Plus, which is $60 a year.

On Twitter, where the subject was one of the top trending topics on Friday, a gamer named Zay said “Xbox users gotta sell their Xbox just so they can get Xbox live gold.”

One user said Microsoft is out of touch with its community and the economic reality.

In justifying the move, Microsoft said the price of Xbox Live Gold “has not changed for years and in some markets, it hasn’t changed for over 10 years.”

There is no price change for existing six-month or 12-month Xbox Live Gold members.","Microsoft Boosts Price of Xbox Live Gold, Sparking Gamer Outrage - Bloomberg",www.bnnbloomberg.ca

He’s right. And while the work is just beginning, it really does feel like a new day for America — not only because of the President’s words but because of his actions.

Today, thanks to executive orders and other directives signed by the President hours after taking office, we are closer to ending this pandemic and better prepared for the next one. Fewer Americans will be evicted from their homes or fall behind on their student loan payments. Dreamers won’t have to live in fear of being deported from the country they call home. The so-called Muslim ban is no longer the law of the land. And by rejoining the Paris climate accords, the United States will once again lead the fight against climate change.

If there’s one thing we know after the last four years, it’s that America’s example matters — especially if we hope to heal our planet.

Our leadership made the Paris Agreement possible, and our ambition encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher. By recommitting ourselves to a low-carbon future, we will serve as an example once again — continuing to reap the benefits of new jobs and industries, and protecting the world we leave to our children.

President Biden will be the first to tell you that rejoining the Paris Agreement is not enough, just as all the other executive actions he took yesterday are not enough.

Belgian chocolatier Godiva will sell or close all 128 of its North American shops within the next few months, the company said this week.

Godiva said it saw a drop in demand for in-person shopping at its brick-and-mortar stores, especially amid the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, the company said it has seen growth in online sales and sales through grocery, club and other retail partners.

CEO Nurtac Afridi, who was appointed to the role last month by Govida’s Turkish parent company Yildiz Holding, said in a written statement that the company has ""always been focused on what our consumers need and how they want to experience our brand, which is why we have made this decision.""

Local reports indicated that many of the Godiva stores will remain open through Valentine’s Day, a major sales period for the chocolatier. The Indianapolis Business Journal reported that an Indianapolis Godiva shop would close on Feb. 15, while The Dallas Morning News reported that seven Texas locations would shutter by the end of March.

Godiva didn’t immediately say how many employees would be affected.

""Of course, this decision was difficult because of the care we have for our dedicated and hard-working chocolatiers who will be impacted,"" Afridi said. ""We are grateful for all they have done to make wonderful moments for our consumers and spread happiness through incredible customer service.""

The move comes less than two years after Godiva announced a push to open 2,000 cafes around the world over six years. The cafes offer a menu expanded beyond chocolate, including baked goods, sandwiches and coffee.

At the time, Godiva has planned to open about a third of those cafes in the U.S.

248,249,https://humanevents.com/2021/01/23/on-canceling-keystone/,"Joe Biden signed an executive order, and thousands of jobs disappeared. In a more philosophical article, we should determine if the President, or any person, should even have such power in a country that ostensibly espouses free markets, but this is not that article. In flyover states, President Biden’s decision actively grew the list of the unemployed at a time of high unemployment and economic hardship. I’d like to ask him: why?

Every election cycle, we see a standard political ad on TV. It’s a boilerplate attack ad using actors pretending to be a married couple. They are at the kitchen table. It’s nighttime, we assume the kids are asleep, and scattered around them are stacks of papers and envelopes. Probably bills. The husband holds one up, and they look at each other despondently, shaking their heads. The wife puts her head in her hand, and the husband places a consoling hand on her shoulder. We’re meant to feel their despair and empathize. This could be you. Then, a voiceover, either the angry male baritone or the heartfelt female alto, menaces “…and when times are so tough, so-and-so candidate supports a plan that punishes families already struggling to make ends meet.” The message: my opponent will cause you pain.

That ad must work because a version of it is reborn every election. And there is an incontrovertible truth to it: American families do worry about finances. A Capitol One survey shows that 77% of Americans say it’s their top concern. Now, more so than ever before; COVID-19 lockdowns had closed nearly 100,000 businesses by last fall, a number which has likely gone up. Unemployment, though on the decline, is still at 6.7%, meaning nearly 11 million Americans are without work. The $600 check from the latest stimulus relief plan is a mere bandaid on an ax wound.

Now there’s an additional 11,000 of those caricatured in political ads, but they aren’t actors. They’re real Americans who, on January 19th, had a job, but are now living out the kitchen table conversation, wondering how to move forward.

I talked to one gentleman on the phone. His name is Lynn. He’s a 52-year-old man who has been a welder since he graduated high school. He makes (made?) a good living, provided for his wife and children, and sent his oldest to college. He supports his local community and hosts the men’s bible study at his home. He was sent home with no new prospects. He is that American in that all-to-familiar political ad. And the candidate who won did this to him… did this to all of them.

Why would the man who campaigned on “good-paying union jobs” eliminate thousands of them, and on his first day in office no less? Why would the man who campaigned on “build back better” stop the construction of something so important to our economy? Why would the man who talks about “critical infrastructure” cancel a fairly routine infrastructure project?

Well, the answer is simple. He’s not a man. He’s a politician.

I’m referring to President Biden’s Executive Order to eliminate the Keystone Pipeline, and though my favorite High School English teacher is concerned I buried this too deep in the article, I felt I had to set the stage because this decision didn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s not some ethereal edict like Biden’s order to emphasize race in our federal government. It’s not flowery rhetoric like a misquoted and misunderstood St. Augustine line about unity added to an inaugural address. The Keystone decision has real and deeply human consequences, and neither the President nor the media seem to care.

In 2019, Congresswoman Ocasio Cortez famously staged a photo-op outside a Texas detention center, where she doubled over in tears and distress. (The event was later parodied by conservative activist Candace Owens, mocking Cortez for her designer clothes and expensive jewelry.) Immigration policies, Cortez’s body language expressed, are deeply human. And so they are.

Our new Vice President, when she was still attacking then fellow candidate-Biden as a racist, attacked his record on busing policies with the line “that girl was me.” So profound (and planned) was that line her campaign even sold tee-shirts (before she suspended her campaign before the Iowa caucus, of course, but that’s the subject of another article). Race issues, her stage performance said, are deeply human. And so they are.

Now, I’m looking for the same compassion for the thousands of energy workers who were given a pink slip by the President of all Americans. I’m looking for the photo ops. I’m looking for the media camera crews racing to places like Nebraska and South Dakota to interview distraught families.

Unfortunately, their plight doesn’t garner such liberal sympathy.

In his confirmation hearing, Secretary of Transportation nominee Pete Buttigieg was pressed by Sen. Ted Cruz about the cancellation of Keystone (since pipeline oversight falls under the DOT’s purview). What about the immediate elimination of 1,200 jobs plus another 11,000 scheduled jobs, Cruz pressed, “what do you say to those workers whose jobs have just been eliminated by presidential edict?” Buttigieg replied, “I think the most important thing is to make sure that we make good on the promise of the President’s climate vision,” later adding, “We are very eager to see those workers continue to be employed in good-paying union jobs even if they might be different ones.” Not a word of compassion. Not a drop of remorse. One who could be so aloof, indifferent, and stupid in such a detached and inhumane answer is not a man. He’s a politician.

Maybe the pipeline workers should identify as transgender athletes. Then they’d have a champion in the White House.

It’s unsurprising Mayor Pete couldn’t spare a drop of kindness for thousands of unemployed. They are from the part of the country where the electoral college interferes with the popular vote. (Eliminating that, he said in 2019, is his top priority.) Mayor Pete doesn’t want these folks even to have a voice in Washington, D.C., so why should he waste precious camera time concerned they don’t have a job?

Maybe I could arrange a call between Mr. Buttigeig and the welder Lynn. Then the future secretary could learn a thing or two about work, dignity, respect. Maybe even Christian charity.

There’s something so fundamentally ordinary and expected of these rural, working-class, red-state workers that they are conveniently forgotten. The great anger growing in this country is that such decisions are celebrated or reported as nonchalantly as the weather. Biden probably doesn’t know any pipeline workers in Kansas, and even if he did, they probably didn’t vote for him. Really, who cares about the heartland? Most of the media is based on two cities: New York and Washington, D.C., and the plight of rural America is quite boring.

Many people have lost their jobs recently. The COVID-19 lockdowns have destroyed entire industries like restaurants and bars, but the leaders who impose these mandates say it’s for good reason: SCIENCE. And you must believe in science. You cannot question science. It’s also SCIENCE that says shut down the pipeline. CLIMATE SCIENCE. Pipelines are bad for the earth.

The oil, which would have been transported 1200 miles from Canada to the Texas gulf coast for refining (and then nationwide distribution and put on tankers for worldwide sale) through the Keystone pipeline, will now be transported by rail or truck. Is that better for the earth? Which has fewer emissions: a truck or a pipeline?

Now, President Biden and team will say, it’s not that pipelines are bad. It’s that fossil fuels are bad. Ok, gotcha. So tell me, the raw materials which go into the manufacturing of “good” products (like wind turbines and solar panels and electric car batteries) are, what? Is the oil and gas and their myriad products, predominantly plastics, which are used to make a wind turbine better than the oil and gas which is used for gas and electricity?

When I mention these things, either online, in debates, or in the media, normally it ends with some accusation of climate and science (CLIMATE SCIENCE) denial. At that point, I know the conversation is over. When you resort to name-calling, you are out of ammo and just want the other person to shut up. “Racist” and “nazi” and “white supremacist” are other words used in that tactic.

We’re entering a period in America where dissent is not tolerated and any view which does not conform to the prevailing liberal view—as espoused by the Biden Administration, the tech industry, Hollywood, etc.—is labeled “extremist” and therefore “dangerous.” I say welcome to the fascists’ party. “The science is settled” were the words meant to end dissent on climate issues long before “the election is over” became the words meant to tell you to shut up and accept the Biden win. Chuck Todd, moderator of NBC’s Meet The Press, famously hosted a show dedicated to climate issues in which he said no outside opinions would even be considered. Why? SCIENCE!

If Keystone was canceled for climate change, how many more victims of climate change are on the horizon? This is just the beginning of an energy agenda that will hurt us on so many levels. It will weaken our economy and cost us both opportunity and revenue. It will hurt our national security as America will forgo domestic energy and become reliant on imports. It will do nothing for the environment.

But it’s also deeply human. It’s families in parts of America that people like Joe Biden claim to care about every time there’s an election. It’s rural communities from whom was stripped, not just a job, not just independence, but also dignity and hope. It’s towns where opioids and suicide are the way out for someone who does not know how to go forward.

There aren’t enough of them to mount a political challenge to fight. They aren’t sophisticated enough to garner national interest. They aren’t minority enough to even spark decent press. And now they wait to be employed again. Soon-to-be Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said he’s “eager” for it. He’s not nearly as eager as Lynn is.

What do they do in the meantime? President Joe Biden does not know, nor does he care. He’s too busy fighting for the soul of the nation. Just ask him.",On Canceling Keystone.,humanevents.com

Police detained over 2,131 people and used force to break up rallies around Russia on Saturday as tens of thousands of protesters demanded the release of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, whose wife was among those detained.

Navalny had called on his supporters to protest after being arrested last weekend as he returned to Russia from Germany for the first time since being poisoned with a nerve agent in August.

The authorities had warned people to stay away from Saturday’s protests, saying they risked catching Covid-19 as well as prosecution and possible jail time for attending an unauthorised event.

But protesters defied the ban and bitter cold, and turned out in force.

In central Moscow, where Reuters reporters estimated at least 40,000 people had gathered in one of the biggest unauthorised rallies for years, the police were seen roughly detaining people, bundling them into nearby vans. Some protesters chanted “Putin is a thief”, and “Disgrace” and “Freedom to Navalny!”

Navalny’s wife Yulia said on social media she had been detained at the rally. She was later released.","Pro-Navalny protests erupt in Russia, 2,000 held",www.telegraphindia.com

Santiago Cane Jr. welcomed the operation of a molecular laboratory for COVID-19 testing in the province, expressing hope this would help improve the fight against the disease.

The laboratory was established at the D.O Plaza Memorial Hospital here. It can generate test results within 24 hours.

The laboratory has two testing equipment although only one is still operational.

Previously, swab samples were sent to the Butuan Medical Center in Butuan City for testing and would take up to four days before results are known.

On Jan. 19, the laboratory at the D.O. Plaza Memorial Hospital processed 61 swab samples and the results were available within seven hours wherein eight individuals were found positive for the coronavirus.

“I certainly hope that with early detection is vital in improving the chances of patients to survive, “ Cane told the Inquirer in an interview.

The provincial government has been aggressive in testing residents using the COVID-19 antigen test kit, making it compulsory for employees of the provincial capitol.

Cane said, however, that the province woud do away with the antigen tests until supplies at the DO Plaza Memorial Hospital could be utilized to avoid duplication in spending.

He said the use of QR code in contact tracing ensures that those found positive with the virus and their close contacts “can be attended to the soonest and put in quarantine or isolation facilities to prevent full blown transmission.”

The COVID-19 laboratory in the province is the fourth established in the Caraga region following the Caraga Regional Hospital in Surigao City, and Butuan Medical Center and MJ Santos Hospital in Butuan City.

251,252,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/father-stan-swamy-pens-letter-on-plight-of-other-undertrials/cid/1804613,"He is 83, ill, and has spent more than 15 weeks in jail. But Father Stan Swamy’s latest letter from Mumbai’s Taloja Central Jail speaks not of his sufferings but of the plight of other undertrials and how he has been deriving inspiration from their spirit of solidarity.

“But we will still sing in chorus. A caged bird can still sing,” the Jesuit priest and tribal rights activist, who completed 100 days in custody on January 16, wrote.

Father Stan, a Parkinsonism patient who cannot hold a glass of water steadily enough to drink from it, has taken the pains to write the letter in his own hand, the Bangalore-based Jesuit priest who has received it told The Telegraph.

The priest, who wished to remain anonymous, said he had released the letter among fellow Jesuits, Father Stan’s supporters and the non-government National Confederation of Human Rights Organisations (NCHRO) on January 22.

Father Stan had earlier too sent out two letters from jail but they had been dictated to a co-accused. These letters had revealed his travails but only to emphasise the help he was receiving from fellow prisoners.

“Many of such poor undertrials don’t know what charges have been put on them, have not seen their chargesheet and just remain in prison for years without any legal or other assistance,” the letter says.

“Overall, almost all undertrials are compelled to live to a bare minimum, whether rich or poor. This brings in a sense of brotherhood and communitarianism where reaching out to each other is possible even in this adversity.”

Father Stan, arrested by the National Investigation Agency from his Ranchi home on October 8, stands accused with 15 other rights activists, lawyers and writers in the Bhima Koregaon case, which relates to caste violence and an alleged Maoist conspiracy.

“The 16 co-accused have not been able to meet each other, as we are lodged in different jails or different ‘circles’ within the same jail,” his letter says, before adding 

 the line about caged birds singing.

The arrest memo issued by NIA inspector Ajay Kumar Kadam against Father Stan on October 8 mentions charges under Indian Penal Code sections 153A, 505(1)(B), 117, 120B, 121, 121A, 124A and 34 as well as several sections of the anti-terror Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

The IPC sections deal with offences ranging from sedition and waging war against the state to promoting enmity between groups, incitement and criminal conspiracy.

The NIA chargesheet accuses Father Stan of being part of a plot by the banned CPI Maoist to take on the Narendra Modi government with the help of an armed militia of Dalits and Muslims.

Father Stan’s supporters say he has been arrested and maligned because of his campaign for the implementation of laws Parliament has passed to safeguard tribal people’s rights.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had at a meeting with three cardinals in Delhi on January 19 refused to intervene with the NIA on behalf of the octogenarian priest.

The NCHRO has selected Father Stan for an award conferred in honour of the late Mukundan C. Menon, journalist and founder of the human rights organisation People’s Union for Civil Liberties. The award ceremony will be held virtually on Sunday. Father Stan told the NCHRO in a letter on January 10 that the prize money of Rs 25,000 should be donated to a fund set up to meet the court expenses of all the 16 Bhima Koregaon accused.",Father Stan Swamy pens letter on plight of other undertrials,www.telegraphindia.com
252,253,https://www.997wtn.com/news/bidens-multilateralism-isnt-enough-to-defend-america/,"Over the past four years, international conditions have changed radically and returning to the multilateralism of the Bush-Obama years won’t offer Joe Biden the leverage needed to deal with China and Russia.

The freedom for swift action that authoritarian regimes enjoy permitted China to quickly suppress COVID-19 and register economic growth in 2020, while Europe and North America suffered greatly from the pandemic and a recession.

Confident in the belief that its system is superior, Beijing is pushing out in all directions — repressing Hong Kong, forcibly assimilating ethnic minorities, continuing a naval buildup that threatens U.S. interests and allies in the Pacific, and co-opting the European Union.

Despite China’s human-rights transgressions, the EU recently signed an investment and trade agreement with Beijing. European leaders point to market-opening opportunities, leverage on Beijing’s climate change policies, and commitments to support labor rights.

However, Beijing has broken numerous commitments on trade and investment in the past, is violating its promise to maintain a two-system one-nation policy in Hong Kong, and appears reticent about commitments on climate change.

Globally, China is the largest source of new greenhouse gases, and no possible solution to the planet heating up is possible without curbing its fossil-fuel use. Last September, Beijing pledged to reach peak CO2 emissions by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2060 but China continues to build coal-fired plants. At the December Climate Ambition Summit, Beijing did not table any meaningful initiatives to reverse those plans.

China shows no remorse for failing to warn the world about COVID-19 and has sought to subvert the World Health Organization to avoid culpability. Now it is pressuring Australia and others who support a WHO investigation — and to refrain from taking issue with its treatment of Hong Kong and repression of Muslims in western provinces.

Europe Recognizes Threat, but Does Little

Trade and foreign investment are the cudgels Beijing uses to weaken Western resistance and punish critics. It is investing heavily in Western European companies to access cutting-edge technology and in Eastern and Central Europe infrastructure, and that could undermine loyalty to NATO.

Sadly, the Europeans recognize the security threats it poses but show inadequate interest, save the U.K., in assisting America’s response to China’s military buildup in the Indo-Pacific or to limiting Beijing’s investments in Europe.

Digital technologies are rapidly dividing the world into two spheres.

One led by China, which preaches the benefits of autocratic government and would be happy to provide acolytes with the tools for the surveillance state and repression. The other is led by America and its advanced allies, who offers technology freely to partners to build wealth, prosperity and mutually respected security.

Russia cannot challenge the United States or NATO in conventional weapons, but the potential for a conventional conflict to ignite a nuclear war permits Russia to pursue great mischief without fear of military retaliation, for example, in the Middle East by supporting U.S. rivals and to engaging in cyberwarfare.

Vladimir Putin can test Biden and is no doubt emboldened by the weak response of the Obama-Biden administration to the Chinese hack of the Office of Personnel Management in 2014. The SolarWinds cyberattack has compromised the data security of multiple U.S. agencies and private corporations — and so far without much American response.

Biden’s commitment to multilateralism and shoring up relations with allies is a process, not a policy. It must be accompanied by a clear message about the challenges that China and Russia pose, and that acknowledges a credible response will be costly to Americans and that articulates with firmness and clarity what we expect from our allies to enjoy our protection.

We cannot trade with China on our current scale without peril and must bear the cost of disengagement. The Germans, for example cannot be dependent on trade with China and buy natural gas from Russia without helping finance their military and cyberwarfare infrastructure.

America must shift its military resources to the Pacific and equip the Navy to inflict fast and certain damage the Chinese don’t dare risk. With populations and GDP well exceeding Russia, our NATO allies must pick up the resulting slack in conventional resources in Europe.

This is Rome vs. Carthage — only one side can win. China and Russia see it that way, consequently, so must we.

Biden’s most comprehensive statements on foreign policy have mostly waxed about the importance of multilateralism, but the recent trade and investment treaty China has accomplished with the EU indicates multilateralism and reliance on allies will prove a hollow policy.

HOUSTON — A drug deal turned deadly has resulted in the arrest of two brothers, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office.

Keldrick Edwards and Gerry Edwards are charged with murder. They're accused of killing a man Jan. 11 at a shopping center on Bissonnet Street in the Alief area.

Investigators said a vehicle pulled into the parking lot, and a short time later, a passenger jumped out and started running. That's when one of the suspects got out of the car and fired at least five shots at the victim, deputies said.

It's possible the men had a dispute concerning a marijuana transaction, sheriffs said.

The victim was found dead outside a mechanic shop near Synott and Bissonnet Street when deputies arrived at the scene, according to officers.

HCSO said the Edwards were identified as suspects and later taken into custody at an apartment complex on Highland Cross in the Spring area.

Deputies recovered the suspected vehicle, a 2018 black Chevrolet Malibu, marijuana and a pistol at the apartment.

And now the image can be part of your wardrobe.

And the silence and acquiescence of the national media to executive orders that suspend regulations protecting the U.S. power grid from Communist China, attempt to redefine sex, and that subvert American-Canadian trade ties and immediately destroy a thousand of well-paying union jobs highlights in stark relief that same divide between an urban, worldly intellectual class and the rural, patriotic working class. The mainstream media is made up almost entirely by the former, and its product reflects that all too well.

Journalism used to be littered with writers whose education did not include a university degree, but instead came from the real world. Damon Runyon, H.L. Mencken, Jimmy Breslin, Paul Anderson were legendary journalists, none of whom ever obtained a university degree. Their formative years were spent in the military taking orders, or on the streets making a wage, trying to make ends meet. The skills they needed to do their job was the ability to speak, observe, and write. Back then, those skills were taught in high school.

There has been a significant rise in substance misuse, overdoses and mental health issues over the course of this past year. Hopefully this trend does not continue into the new year and we start to see more and more people start their journey of recovery. Recovery from a substance use disorder happens through a series of positive changes accomplished over time. For people in recovery, 2021 brings an opportunity to continue building on these changes. I challenge you to wake up daily and ask yourself, “What can I do for my recovery today?” Here are some ideas to get you started: Be grateful. Each morning or night, take a minute to write down one thing you are grateful for. It can be a person, a feeling, a material possession, an opportunity, a place – anything. Keep a journal noting these items over the year and look back on it at the end of the year to see everything you have to be thankful for. Be mindful. Mindfulness meditation has been proved to increase chances of long-term recovery from a substance use disorder. It provides tools necessary to take life one moment at a time. When you live life in the moment, you will experience less stress and anxiety by reducing worry and negative thought processes. Just 10-15 minutes of mindfulness meditation can increase your chances of a successful recovery from substance misuse.

Schedule your day. Make a list of things that need to be done, and then schedule them. The more structure you have to your day, the less likely you are to run into stress by forgetting to do things or running out of time. Stress is one of the most significant relapse triggers, so anything that keeps stress at bay is helpful in recovery. Some things that can be added to your schedule include wake up and sleep times, meals, engaging in hobbies, exercise, meditation and recovery activities such as attending recovery meetings. Use a recovery support app daily. There are many to choose from:
• SoberGrid allows you to create online profiles and interact, support and engage with other people in recovery using a platform similar to Facebook. You can also use the app to create anonymous check-ins about whether you’re sober or not, your mood and what’s going on.
• SoberTool is an easy way to track your clean and sober days. The app includes daily motivational messages and reminders to keep you on target.
• WEconnect provides daily reminders to stay on track with your recovery plan. You can create reminders to call your sponsor, go to a group meeting, or meditate – anything you need to provide that extra push.
• AABigBook This app gives access to the full text of the Big Book, along with a meeting finder, podcasts, prayers and personal stories.

Kern County Superior Court Judge Kenneth C. Twisselman ruled in favor of Tejon Ranch and Kern County over an ongoing habitat conservation challenge by the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), an Arizona-based environmental organization, regarding the California Condor. The recent ruling allows the company to move forward with developments for Grapevine.

“We are extremely pleased the court thoughtfully and thoroughly considered the issues, found that we had satisfied the court’s original ruling and decided to rule against the claims in this latest lawsuit,” said Hugh F. McMahon, Executive Vice President of real estate at Tejon Ranch Co., in a statement Friday. “Once again CBD tried to hijack and abuse the California Environmental Quality Act in their continued attempts to prevent any and all thoughtful and responsible real estate development in California.”

Twisselman rejected the most recent lawsuit filed by CBD, which challenged Kern County’s Dec. 2019 re-approval of Grapevine at Tejon Ranch. The court rejected CBD’s attempt to re-litigate issues it had already sued on and lost. It also determined that the County’s analysis of the internal capture rate for the California Condor, as ordered by the court, was complete and in full compliance with the court’s previous ruling.

The lawsuit was the 12th legal action filed by CBD against Tejon Ranch and its interests since 2003. The plaintiffs had previously filed an environmental lawsuit against Kern County in 2009 for its approval of the Tejon Mountain Village project and lost in both the superior and appellate state courts. CBD has also sued to obstruct and delay other Tejon Ranch developments including the expansion of the Tejon Ranch Commerce Center, where both courts ultimately rejected CBD’s claims, according to the company.

In Dec. 2016, the Kern County Board of Supervisors approved the development of Grapevine. CBD sued the following year, and lost six of the seven issues it raised regarding the sufficiency of the project’s environmental impact report. On the seventh issue, the court ruled that there was a deficiency regarding the internal capture rate used in their impact report and ordered a revised version.

The updated environmental impact report was subject to a full public review and was ultimately re-approved unanimously by the Kern County Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors in 2019. The County’s approval was challenged yet again by CBD, first in a late-hit letter filed one day before the Board of Supervisors met to consider the project, and then again in court.

Tejon Ranch Co. officials say that they remain “fully committed to the ongoing stewardship of the ranch’s 270,000 acres, as it has done for over 175 years.”

261,262,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ivan-wong-shares-four-expert-tips-to-shoot-light-trails-301213531.html,"NEW YORK, Jan. 23, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- New York and LA-based photographer Ivan Wong shares his expert insights on shooting light trails. Wong is hailed as one of the most popular photographers of 2020, and he starts the new year with grander aspirations. He surged to popularity via Instagram after he moved to New York from LA when he started sharing his photos on Instagram.

He delved into shooting cityscapes and breathtaking architecture and significantly advanced further, exploring different techniques and aesthetics. He went on to mastering conventional and digital photography and also became an ambassador for Sony Alpha. He was also recognized as one of the most prominent Google Pixel ambassadors.

Wong has often shared his thoughts on photography techniques. He fundamentally lays all focus on a single piece of advice—never stop exploring and exposing yourself to challenges. He recalls his aesthetic charms and city skyline works due to consistent exploration, testing of different methods and techniques.

Wong adds that photographers should bet on long exposures to shoot light trails, especially in moving shots. He adds that shooting at a faster shutter speed can virtually stop the time, but it fails to capture the aesthetic quality. So, a photographer should do some takes until they get the right adjustment of shutter speed most appropriate for their subject. A longer time will capture more motion and light streaks and less of the subject so set it to a point where you can ideally balance the two for the composition in mind.

Next, he shares that adjusting your ISO can significantly help you achieve the results you want. Wong reflects that most novice photographers struggle with ""noise"" in their photographers. With long exposures, it's best to start at a low ISO like 100 and only increase this after exhausting the ideal settings for aperture and then shutter speed, ideally in that order.

The next important thing he recalls is to invest in a mid-range tripod that can offer your device just the right amount of sturdiness for long exposure. It's also important to invest in a wireless trigger either using native camera apps, those connected to smartphones, or 3rd party triggers. Long exposures are prone to detecting shakes so it's key to avoid any physical movements to the camera when shooting.

But the job doesn't end there—one must move around, try different angles, and see which side of the subject offers the best frame. Shooting low can make up a very dynamic composition. Ivan Wong concludes that there is no such thing as the ""perfect shot.""

But as the pandemic has progressed, tips for restaurant workers have declined and taken into consideration. Out of 50 states, Onley seven pay full minimum wage to tipped workers. It's time we step in for these crucial employees. According to HUFFPOST, tips should be between 15 and 20% on large orders and a flat rate of 5 to $10 on smaller orders. AARP concurs and adds To get familiar with your delivery APS some app set a default tip amount, which you can always alter if need be. And speaking of APS, Market Watch reported, the endemic has more than doubled food delivery APS business. But if you're looking to directly support your local restaurant, skip the APP and contact the business directly. NPR reports food delivery APS have different ways of formulating fees, but could range from 20 to 40%. Bottom line. If you can afford it, tip well and contact your restaurant directly next time.

In those cities, local governments have passed temporary caps that limit how much third-party delivery platforms can charge restaurants to help struggling business.

Those platforms can charge commission fees as high as 30% per order, which can leave restaurants in the red.But now, with dining rooms completely closed or open with limited capacity, many restaurant operators feel they have to offer delivery or go out of business.

ALABAMA, USA — If you're a fan of highly-sought bourbons, whiskies and other small-batch spirits, or what the Alabama ABC Board calls ""allocated spirits"", the way you buy them is about to change.

Beginning in February 2021, monthly releases of allocated spirits will be published and you can buy two different bottles per person, per day. This is a change to the previous rule that allowed a customer to purchase one bottle per allocated spirit per day. This new two bottle limit only applies to limited-release ""allocated spirits"" products. ABC hopes that this will make the products available to more customers.

According to the ABC's website, if an item is limited in either the amount of product that they have access to OR it is limited in the total time that it can be offered to customers, the AABC considers that item to be ""allocated"".

Not all products will be available at all stores. ABC explains that they only have enough product sent to them to send out to a limited number of stores. All product is shipped from their warehouse in full case amounts so the number of cases available, not the number of bottles available, also determines the number of stores that receive products. They try to send allocated product where the most citizens live or shop. For example, on the ABC's FAQ page, they explain that 120 stores meet criteria specific to sales of Bourbon. 30 stores are allocated product every month and the remaining identified stores are sent allocations quarterly.

Where can I find a list of these Alabama ABC ""allocated spirits""?

Lists are published monthly on the ABC's website calendar. Purchases are for Alabama residents and military personnel stationed in Alabama only. ID or proof of residence is required to purchase limited-release items. The two bottles-per-day limit is intended to make the items available to as many Alabama residents as possible.

Recently, Alabama temporarily closed 41 stores across the state due to COVD-19 and staffing issues. The stores are expected to reopen in late February or early March.",Alabama ABC updates 'allocated spirits' purchase process in stores,www.rocketcitynow.com

The committee, with more than 350 members, deliberated the resolution and eventually voted against it in a 134-49 vote, a committee member told the Louisville Courier Journal. The meeting was called by more than 30 GOP county chairs and vice chairs.

""As a political party, we're in a unique position to bring all sides of our organization together to have conversations about the direction we are going in and what we expect from our elected officials,"" a statement released after the meeting said.

McConnell defended the former president during his first impeachment hearing, when the House brought two articles of impeachment against him for his dealings with Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelensky.

Trump was impeached for a historic second time this month in the House for ""incitement of insurrection"" after he encouraged a crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6.

Following his remarks, a group of rioters breached Capitol security, breaking windows, vandalizing lawmakers' offices and forcing both chambers of Congress to evacuate their respective floors to undisclosed locations. Five people were left dead after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer who had served on the force for 12 years.

The Senate will begin the hearing on impeachment on Feb. 9.

However, McConnell has not announced how he will vote during the impeachment trial and has stated that he'll ""listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.""

McConnell condemned Trump’s actions in a Senate speech and said the mob was “provoked by the president.”

The Nelson County GOP's executive committee censured McConnell for the statement.

Many Republican senators have not said how they plan to vote for impeachment. There would need to be 17 Republican votes for Trump to be convicted.

""In the end it is our intention to return our focus to bringing civility to the party and continue having larger conversations about how we can attract more voters and grow our party,"" the State Central Committee said in its statement.

Prosecutors asked a judge on Friday to keep the man, Garret Miller, in jail ahead of a court appearance, according to court records. They revealed five criminal charges in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia against Miller on Wednesday, including for making death threats and trespassing offenses.

Images of social media posts allegedly authored by Miller, which appear to announce his trip to the Capitol and threaten the life of Ocasio-Cortez as well as a Capitol Police officer, are cited in the court filing.

Prosecutors said Miller made numerous threatening remarks online, including one instance in which he commented ""next time we bring the guns"" on a Twitter video showing rioters exiting a Capitol building.

As rioters broke into the Capitol, Ocasio-Cortez worried her own colleagues in Congress might divulge her location to the mob, putting her at risk for kidnapping or worse, according to an Instagram Live video she recorded on Jan. 12.

Ocasio-Cortez also said that she experienced ""a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die"" on Jan. 6, adding that she could not get into specifics for security reasons, according to a Washington Post account of the video.

The hospital system is putting vaccines into arms as quickly as it can get doses of the vaccine, said Donna Isgett, chief operating officer of McLeod Health and chairwoman of the South Carolina Hospital Association board. Getting doses is the holdup, she said. ""We've administered what we've been given. We're doing great,"" said Lesli McGee, who is serving as incident commander for delivering vaccines at the hospital. ""We're getting all the second doses we're asking for. If I have given you your first shot I have to make sure I have the second shot."" ""The first doses is where we're waiting on additional allocation from the state. I can tell you we don't get the full amount we request,"" McGee said. ""We have more people who want doses in that 1a group, particularly as we open up to patients, than we are receiving,"" McGee said. ""Our plan is to issue everything we get and keep asking until we have pushed the envelope in every population until everyone who wants it gets it."" ""I've been very assertive about 'just send me some more vaccine,'"" Isgett said. ""I want to get it. I'm where Lesli is. McLeod Health wants to see it to everybody who would benefit.""

And it's not just the residents in phase 1a 70-and-older who are anxiously awaiting their vaccines. There are still have numerous EMS workers in Cheraw and Bennettsville who haven't had a vaccine because McLeod hasn't been able to get a consistent supply. ""We're pushing hard for vaccine,"" Isgett said. ""We asked for 10,000 doses this week; we believed we could deliver 10,000 doses this week. The governor said put them on your shelf, take them off and put them into arms. We ended up getting 3,900 second doses,"" Isgett said. ""We got 1,950 first doses and that includes patients, first responders, McLeod employees,"" McGee said. The current expectations on vaccines may not be reasonable, McGee said. ""We are a society that wants things when we want them and being so instantaneous many times you get it,"" McGee said. ""It makes it hard to be patient when you have something this big to roll out across the state."" When it comes to the vaccine and expectations, McGee said, the big numbers that are out there aren't nearly as big as they seem. ""The state's going to get 800,000 doses; that means that 400,000 people and 200,000 of those went to CVS and Walgreen's,"" she said.

The remainder of the doses are then passed out to the state's hospitals to administer while CVS and Walgreen's use theirs to vaccinate long-term care facility residents. And all doses are not the same -- at least from an accounting and healthcare standpoint. First doses and second doses are treated differently. ""We're getting all the second doses we're asking for,"" McGee said. ""If I have given you your first shot I have to make sure I have the second shot. ""The first doses are where we're waiting on additional allocation from the state. I can tell you we don't get the full amount we request,"" McGee said. ""I think everybody is doing their part,"" McGee said of the distribution effort so far. ""I think everybody has to dig in and request as much as we can."" Tuesday a steady flow of people worked their way through the lobby at McLeod Plaza where they would go through intake in one small meeting room before they headed to a larger meeting room where they'd get the vaccine in one area and spend 15 minutes sitting in another area before departing. The line Tuesday at lunch was never longer than one or two people. ""I do have a plan,"" McGee said of getting people vaccinated.

Your subscription makes our reporting possible. {{featured_button_text}} ""We have those everywhere,"" McGee said of the Plaza vaccine clinic. ""That's the mode. Our team has those setup on all the campuses. We are not struggling to get the vaccine we're allocated out to the population that we're in right now, which is 1a."" And that success is achieved with an all-hands-on-deck approach. ""We pulled every non-direct-patient-care nurse who had the ability to give shots and pulled them into this work,"" Isgett said. ""People who were doing important work but we prioritized to pull them in. We have our former administrator of McLeod Regional in there giving shots. We have our administrator of McLeod Darlington giving shots. I volunteered to give shots. I'm a nurse by background and I can still give shots."" And the program, designed by McGee and Octavia Williams Blake, is scalable. While the hospital asked for 10,000 doses to deploy in one week, Isgett said with a bit more staff 20,000 a week is just as doable. ""We absolutely could if we could get our hands on vaccines,"" Isgett said. ""He must have used the words 'go to your hospital' 15 times,"" Isgett said of Gov. Henry McMaster's latest press conference on the virus. And it has been that way from the start of the pandemic.

Before stand-alone testing sites were mobilized it was McLeod and MUSC Florence that were conducting COVID testing. ""We have the burden of testing, then we got the most critical burden, that only we can do, is care for the sick, particularly the most critically sick,"" Isgett said. ""We've really laid at the foot of hospitals — testing, trying to keep them out of the hospital with monoclonal antibody clinics, treat them while they're in the hospital, deal with the dying and the stress that places on your staff and now vaccinate the living,"" Isgett said. ""That's a lot to lay at the feet of a hospital system and the ability to operationalize all that rapidly."" ""If you think about what this state, this healthcare system, has had to mobilize over the last 11 months it's nothing short of heroic. To keep nurses at bedside when they themselves are getting sick. To have an open faucet of patients that exceeds our capacity on many days across our region. To watch us switch staff from one region to another,"" Isgett said. ""You're in a year-long crisis so I believe even from the governor's stance he believes he's doing what's right for the citizens of the state,"" she said of the governor's directives — such as expanding who qualifies for the vaccine. ""It's hard to operationalize all those things."" Throw in the ever-changing and mutating virus and the science that follows.

""I'm not even critiquing the hospitals that haven't done 100 percent of their vaccine. I appreciate how difficult it is to turn on a dime and then the rules change the next week and they change again,"" Isgett said. ""The agility of this team has just been impressive,"" Isgett said of her hospital. Isgett said that people need to understand that combating the virus is akin to living in a real-time science experiment. Situations change and the medical community learns, adapts and treats. ""We're working on something that's moving all the time,"" Isgett said. ""Will we learn better how to do it? You're absolutely right."" ""I'm sure we're going to look back and see a lot of opportunities for improvement. It's hard being right in the middle of this and knowing you have at least enough ability to double what you're delivering,"" she said. And time is not on humanity's side. ""We're also working against time and some worry about a more contagious strain in Europe,"" Isgett said. ""If you don't have enough people vaccinated you won't have enough herd immunity"" to be able to blunt, or prevent, the next spike. ""We need people to give grace, know where our hearts are,"" Isgett said of the state's hospitals. ""Know operationally we are really doing yeoman's work. But to have grace that we're working as hard as we can work.""",McLeod administrator: We're administering vaccines as fast as we can get them,scnow.com

There are many versions of this horrifying story. The Muffin Man, also known as the Drury Lane Dicer, was the first known serial killer in England. His name was Frederic Thomas Lynwood, and he was born in 1563 and died in 1612. There are many accounts of Lynwood’s crimes, however, no surviving records. This is either one hell of a folklore story or one of history’s most creepy mysteries.

In Victorian England, it was common for families to have fresh foods delivered to their homes. If you’re in the US, imagine the Milk Man from the 1950s, same deal. Every morning, Victorian families could expect to find a parcel of bread for that day’s meals. A popular morning meal was muffins, but these were more like English muffin bread and less like sugary sweet American muffins.

The Muffin Man would make his deliveries just like other bakers, but he would lure children away from their homes by playfully tying a string it a muffin and pulling it away from the steps where the parcel lay. The kids, likely thinking this was a fun game, would chase the muffins, which led to The Muffin Man’s bakery, where he would kill the children. But not before torturing them.

The Muffin Man did not appreciate the fierce competition in his surrounding neighborhoods. So he murdered seven other bakers, or so the tales go.

The life of a baker in Victorian England was not lucrative or pleasant. For starters, everyone wanted bread delivered. The middle class could afford to have fresh foods delivered to their homes, and during various times of the year, bread deliveries would skyrocket. However, the bakers did not have giant electric mixers, and most could not afford to hire a staff. So, bakers did all of the work themselves, which meant that their daily shift would begin around ten or eleven at night, leaving the only time for sleep during the moments when the dough was rising. Working under such strenuous circumstances commonly meant that the quality of bread was a crapshoot. For example, some bakers had to double-time to keep up with their orders and knead the dough with their feet.

The Muffin Man seemed to have taken pleasure in taunting and torturing children before he killed them. According to lore, he used wooden spoons to knock children out. However, experts have long cast doubt that a wooden spoon would be enough to render a person unconscious. Still, the stories persist.

Between the years 1589 and 1598, Lynwood murdered 15 children. His shop was a popular spot for kids to visit, where they would run and cause havoc. What unsupervised kid wouldn’t run around a bakery? Supposedly, Lynwood wanted them to stay away from his shop, so he devised a vicious plan. He lured children intentionally to his shop by pulling a muffin on a string. Once inside, he would knock them out and then kill them.

Children came up with a catchy sing-song rhyme to sing that supposedly was a way to warn other children to stay away from Lynwood’s bakery and to be wary of those around them. It goes like this:

Do you know the muffin man?

Do you know the muffin man

No one knows if this story is true. It has been told (and retold) so many times that the story’s true origins are forever lost.

Several readers helpfully pointed out that the timing of The Muffin Man is too early to be considered Victorian times. The term ‘Victorian times’ refers to the years in which Queen Victoria reigned over England from 1837 to 1901. The Muffin Man allegedly lived during the 16th century, which was known as the English Renaissance. Thank you to those who caught this and brought it to my attention!",Do You Know The Muffin Man?

272,273,https://www.ksl.com/article/50093251/utah-national-guard-begins-helping-with-covid-19-vaccinations,"SALT LAKE CITY — The Utah National Guard this week added new support to the COVID-19 response mission.

Working with the Utah Department of Health, guardsmen are now giving vaccinations and antibody infusions to patients in long-term care facilities throughout the state.

""It's a historic response. We're just glad to be a part of it,"" said Tech Sgt. Erik Bornemeier, a trained medic who has been assisting with the COVID-19 response since early May.

It's his job to build programs for the Utah National Guard. He was involved in building up the COVID-19 response programs they are using today.

Earlier this week, members of the Utah National Guard started giving vaccinations in Utah County to civilians age 70 and older.

""I've had a lot of my colleagues and other guardsmen that have said that this has been the most impactful mission in their guard career,"" said Bornemeier.

They are excited to be on the front lines helping the governor ramp up the delivery of vaccines. It's an important mission because of the spike in demand.

""We've seen a huge, huge demand – websites going down because so many people want to get the vaccine,"" said Capt. Jeremy Metzger.

He helped put together multiple strike teams that can mobilize throughout the state to deliver vaccinations and antibody infusions.

""If a county needs us, we can mobilize our people in a matter of hours, and get down there and vaccinate people all day,"" Metzger said.

Their team gave more than 1,400 vaccinations Thursday in Utah County. They are also giving antibody infusions to patients in long-term care facilities. When a patient tests positive for COVID-19, they have a seven-day window to administer the IV treatment.

""It gives the patient the ability to fight COVID-19 better,"" said Bornemeier. ""So it gives them those antibodies that they are needing to get well faster.""

Guardsmen are also still helping with mobile COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, managing personal protective equipment and other support missions to assist the Utah Department of Health.

""It's incredible to be able to give back to our community,"" said Metzger. ""That's what we do. We are the Utah National Guard. This is our state and our citizens, and our friends and our neighbors.""

Right now, approximately 350 members of the guard are assisting with the COVID-19 response in Utah. But these airmen anticipate more will be called upon in the weeks ahead.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called members of the Utah National Guard home from Washington, D.C. after they were deployed to help with security during President Joe Biden's inauguration.

Those soldiers will now help with vaccinations in Utah, Cox said.",Utah National Guard begins helping with COVID-19 vaccinations,www.ksl.com

A cinematographer went to town early this month to say, enough is enough, someone has to take a stand, and he took it. He refused to join the team of a Kangana Ranaut-starrer.

Politics. Should it play such a huge part in creative choices?

A critic refusing to watch a film by Vivek Agnihotri. Taapsee Pannu refusing to act in The Tashkent Files. Arjun Mathur regretting his association with The Accidental Prime Minister, vowing not to repeat such an unhappy experience. Anupam Kher feeling isolated after making his leanings clear. Swara Bhasker telling me that her political utterances have put her career in jeopardy.

Is there a new intolerance to another view being practised in the Hindi film industry, where assignments are sized up not by what’s on offer but by who your colleagues vote for?

The latest to do a political film is Richa Chadha, the actress who has strong ideological beliefs that she’s unafraid to publicly express.

Madam Chief Minister is the first film with a backbone of politics that fell into her kitty. Did she agree to play the somewhat Mayawati-resembling-Dalit-leader because she agreed with its politics?

Swirling in short films shot during the lockdown (Unpaused and 55 km/sec), working in a Web series in the hills near Naintal, going through a mandatory Covid-19 test at Mumbai airport on landing, and threats from the Bhim Sena that put a price on her head and wanted her tongue severed, Richa retained her composure and replied without agitation, “It’s the story of one woman from an oppressed community who is a librarian. Something happens which involves her in politics, she rises to the top and becomes the CM. So it’s not really about politics, it’s about this one lady.”

Since you are a politically aware actress, would it matter in your choices?

“It does matter,” she accepted. “We can’t always be perfect in our choices but if the film was encouraging caste-based discrimination, I probably wouldn’t have done it.”

With bike-riding at night in rural UP and shooting with large crowds and mashaals, it was a physically challenging but an exhilarating experience.

What if a film came along where you didn’t agree with its ideology?

“Not too many of this nature have come to me. But I would probably not do such a film because I don’t want to be unhappy when I’m at work.”

Swara said her politics has harmed her career.

“Somehow, my politics has not affected my career at all,” Richa said emphatically. “Perhaps,” she offered as an explanation, “Swara and I have different ways of expressing our beliefs.”

Did she think the cinematographer was right in letting his politics decide his professional choices?

Richa would make a fine politician herself as she said like a diplomat, “It’s entirely up to the individual. What if he was unhappy working with somebody he disagreed with? You and I may be tolerant and work with everyone but someone else may think differently. And doing a film is a long involvement.”

Despite completely contrary ideologies, Richa worked with Kangana without fireworks in Panga. “But we definitely didn’t discuss politics,” she smartly pointed out. “We avoided awkward discussions. I have worked with several other people with whom I’ve been able to have these discussions. But I guess it depends on your equation with the other person.” Clearly, it was not a buddies’ equation between her and Ms Ranaut.

With that we moved to the Covid-driven delay in her wedding to actor Ali Fazal, and the probability of it turning into an issue when she does say “I do”. “We had to delay it... We couldn’t endanger so many people. We’re keenly watching the vaccine trials, hopefully the wedding will happen soon.”

Any apprehensions of it being labelled a love jihad? “I’m not apprehensive,” she said firmly, “because it’s a manufactured political debate. They just want to control women, control their choices. Some people are going around saying even the consent of the woman doesn’t matter, the families have to agree.” In her case, both his and her families said “qubool” a long time ago.","My politics, my work",www.telegraphindia.com

The government announced Friday night that Transport Minister Joel Matiza had died of COVID-19. On Wednesday, the president's office said Sibusiso Busi Moyo, Zimbabwe's minister of foreign affairs and international trade, had died of complications related to COVID-19.

Pallbearers wait for coffins to arrive at a state burial of government ministers who died of COVID-19, in Harare, Zimbabwe, Jan. 21, 2021.

Zimbabweans have taken to social media to blame the deaths on President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government, which takes senior officials abroad for treatment instead of rehabilitating the country's collapsed health care delivery system.

Critics say Mnangagwa and his predecessor, the late Robert Mugabe, never bothered to upgrade hospitals or adequately pay health workers, who have recently been on strike for more personal protective equipment and better salaries.

Munashe Bradnick, 31, an accountant, noted that Zimbabweans were not celebrating the deaths of senior government officials.

""I am not so much about their deaths, but how they lived,"" Bradnick said. ""At a personal level, I am mourning the lives that they spent killing others, looting resources, instead of spending on education and health, which would have saved them at this crucial moment.

""So, reminding them that they should have spent money on education and not looting is not a celebration. But it is just a lesson to those who are remaining in ZANU-PF. We must not be killed for demanding better health because COVID is not a respecter of persons. When it comes, it does not respect your office, doesn't respect your status in society. It just kills you. So here we are not celebrating anything, we are just reminding them that life is sacred. Even for us, we need to survive.""

Following the surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths, Zimbabwe's deputy health minister, Dr. John Mangwiro, said in a statement that ""complacency and negligence"" over the festive season were major causes. He said people should take more precautions and adhere to the dusk-to-dawn curfew government imposed early this month.

Clifford Hlatshwayo, spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change Alliance, said the recent surge in coronavirus cases confirmed that lockdowns alone had failed to contain the pandemic.

""Zimbabwe [has] more than 90 percent of its population in the informal sector and those in the streets just roaming around,"" he said. ""Those are the people who do not have money to go to China. Government [is] able to jet to China to get proper medical things. Our health institutions are in a sorry state. And for years the government has not shown interest in upgrading them and making sure that our health institutions are equipped with proper and adequate equipment. Our frontline workers do not have adequate PPEs, drugs, even oxygen.""

In a state of the nation address broadcast Saturday on national television, Mnangagwa said his government was assessing coronavirus vaccines that have been developed worldwide, but he was worried about the spike in COVID-19 cases in Zimbabwe.

But no official cause of death has been released, and U.S. Capitol Police have said only that he died “due to injuries sustained while on-duty.”

A Texas man is facing multiple criminal charges after allegedly participating in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and posting death threats against Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, and a U.S. Capitol police officer.

The Department of Justice revealed that Garret Miller faces five criminal charges, including trespassing and making death threats.

Using the initials widely used to refer to the New York Democrat, Miller tweeted ""assassinate AOC"" hours after he posted pictures of himself storming the Capitol. That tweet was in response to one in which Ocasio-Cortez called for President Donald Trump to be impeached, which he was a week later on a charge of inciting the mob of his supporters.

According to the criminal complaint, Miller was particularly incensed by the fatal shooting of one of those supporters, Ashli Babbitt, during the attack. On Jan. 10, Miller is alleged to have threatened the Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, saying on Instagram he was going to ""hug his neck with a nice rope."" Six days later, he said the officer deserved to die and that it was ""huntin season.""

Miller was arrested on Jan. 20 and made his first court appearance Friday. Miller’s detention hearing is set for Monday.

More:National Guard troops back at US Capitol after being forced to move to a nearby garage

Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Friday about Miller's arrest, quoting his Facebook comment that he ""just wanted to incriminate myself a little.""

""Well, you did,"" she wrote.

The FBI linked Miller to the attack on the Capitol through a video posted by Twitter user @garretamiller that was captioned ""From inside congress"" and was filmed inside the Capitol rotunda. The Twitter account was registered under a cell phone number belonging to Miller, a subpoena for AT&T revealed. The FBI also found several posts relating to the attack on Miller's Facebook account.

""I am about to drive across the country for this trump s---,"" Miller wrote in a Jan. 2 post. ""Some crazy s--- going to happen this week. Dollar might collapse ... civil war could start ... not sure what to do in DC.""

The complaint also stated that Miller posted a photo of himself and another rioter inside the Capitol on Facebook and was seen on surveillance video from inside the rotunda.

In response to Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet saying to ""impeach"" Trump, Miller claimed, ""We acted with honor"" and in another post he claimed the crowd had been ""gentle."" But video of the attack has revealed violent attacks on police officers, one of whom died. The Associated Press, citing unidentified sources, reported that the officer who died, Brian Sicknick, may have been hit in the head by a fire extinguisher. But no official cause of death has been released, and U.S. Capitol Police have said only that he died “due to injuries sustained while on-duty” and provided no other details.

According to the criminal complaint, Miller later said on Instagram that he had a rope in his bag when he entered the Capitol. And in another post, he said, ""next time we bring the guns.""

Clint Broden, Miller's attorney told The Associated Press in an email that Miller regrets the actions he took in support of the former president.

""His social media comments reflect very ill-considered political hyperbole in very divided times and will certainly not be repeated in the future,"" Broden said in the email. ""He looks forward to putting all of this behind him.""

During an Instagram Live with the New York congresswoman after the attack on the Capitol, Ocasio-Cortez told viewers that she had ""a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die"" and that she didn't ""know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive.""

Death threats aren't new for Ocasio-Cortez. In 2019, she said that she receives them ""every day.""

Another man was arrested in 2020 after threatening Ocasio-Cortez. Timothy Ireland of Ohio was arrested in May last year after Capitol Police received a tip that he wrote that Ocasio-Cortez ""should be shot"" on Facebook. Ireland later admitted to the statement, saying he was proud of it, according to a case affidavit.

According to court documents, agents from the U.S. Capitol Police and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found seven rounds of ammunition in Ireland's home. He eventually pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of ammunition.","Texas man charged after storming US Capitol, making death threats against Rep.

277,278,https://www.pressherald.com/2021/01/23/republican-opposition-to-bidens-stimulus-relief-intensifies/,"President Biden’s pitch for bipartisan unity to defeat the coronavirus and resurrect the economy is crashing into a partisan buzz saw on Capitol Hill, where Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on ground rules for running the Senate – let alone pass a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill.

Biden’s relief package is being declared dead on arrival by senior Senate Republicans, some of whom say there has been little, if any, outreach from the Biden team to get their support. Liberals are demanding the president abandon attempts to make a bipartisan deal altogether and instead ram the massive legislation through without GOP votes. And outside groups are turning up the pressure for Biden and the Democrats who control Congress to enact economic relief quickly, even if it means cutting Republicans out of the deal.

In the face of these competing pressures, Biden may discover he can get a big COVID-19 stimulus bill or a bipartisan deal – but not both. The path Biden chooses with his first major piece of legislation could set the tone for the remainder of his first term in office, revealing whether he can make good on his promise to unify Congress and the country.

“It’s important that Democrats deliver for America. If the best path to that is to do it in a way that can bring Republicans along, I’m all in favor of that,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said. “But if Republicans want to cut back to the point that we’re not delivering what needs to be done, then we need to be prepared to fight them. Our job is to deliver for the American people.”

Publicly, top aides insist Biden is serious about wanting a bipartisan deal on the relief bill. They say this should be achievable given the magnitude of the economic and health-care crisis besetting the nation a year after the pandemic began, with more than 412,000 dead and the economy newly shedding jobs. Some Democrats have expressed optimism that GOP frustration with how the Trump administration ended could convince some Republicans to be more open to a fresh start with a Democratic president, especially since longtime lawmakers know Biden from his decades in the Senate and as vice president.

But when Biden’s relief plan rang in at nearly $2 trillion this month, and included liberal priorities like an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, some Republicans saw it as a sign that Biden wasn’t really serious about getting their support. Even those Republicans who have suggested they’re open to making a deal have made clear that the package would need to undergo significant changes.

“I suspect the whole package is a nonstarter, but it’s got plenty of starters in it. And a lot of them are things that we proposed in terms of more assistance to the states,” said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., referring to money for vaccine distribution and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “There’s some things in there that aren’t going to happen. There’s some things that can happen. And that’s how this process should work.”

Outreach to GOP lawmakers before and after the plan’s release appears to have occurred only at the staff level so far and has been confined to a limited number of senators, including members of a bipartisan group who helped break a stalemate over coronavirus relief legislation late last year.

On Sunday, Biden economic adviser Brian Deese was scheduled to directly brief the senators in that group on a Zoom call. But as of Friday, Senate GOP leadership had not been formally briefed, and multiple GOP lawmakers who are part of the bipartisan talks said they had heard nothing from the White House, even though Biden pitched himself on the campaign trail as a bipartisan dealmaker.

“I have not personally (heard from the White House), and I’m disappointed in that, not about me but about, you know, it’s one thing to talk about outreach, another thing to do it,” said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, a senior lawmaker who is a member of the bipartisan group that will confer Sunday with Deese.

“It’s much more successful around here if you try to get the bipartisanship at the start so that it’s a foundation of trust,” Portman added.

Instead, Biden unveiled his $1.9 trillion plan without any bipartisan buy-in, leaving Republicans to question the need for such a big new package coming on the heels of the $900 billion Congress approved in December for economic relief, vaccines and more. Including that legislation, Congress has already devoted about $4 trillion to fighting the pandemic and the economic devastation it wrought.

“I look forward to hearing their views. My own thought is that we should only be spending money where there is need that needs to be met, and so I’d like to see the figures and calculations behind their proposal,” Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, another member of the bipartisan group, said. “I think there’s a recognition on both sides of the aisle that where there’s need, we in Congress have a responsibility to help meet that. But we don’t want to be borrowing money that’s not absolutely necessary.”

Questioned about how a nearly $2 trillion package filled with proposals that are anathema to Republicans could be described as a bipartisan overture, White House press secretary Jen Psaki insisted it was.

“Is unemployment insurance only an issue that Democrats in the country want? Do only Democrats want their kids to go back to schools? Do only Democrats want vaccines to be distributed across the country?” Psaki said at a White House press briefing. “He feels that package is designed for bipartisan support.”

She said Biden would be getting personally engaged in finding support for his plan. “He’s very eager to be closely involved, roll up the sleeves . . . and make the calls himself,” she said.

Psaki said that in trying to sell the package to Republicans, the White House approach would be to ask them which priorities they would cut. The wide-ranging proposal includes a new round of $1,400 stimulus checks to individuals, an extension and increase in emergency unemployment benefits that would otherwise expire in mid-March, and an enhanced child tax credit, as well as hundreds of billions of dollars to help schools reopen and increase testing and vaccine production and delivery.

Some Republicans are open to a number of these provisions but view others – such as the minimum wage increase – as unrelated to the coronavirus and designed to appease an antsy liberal base more than garner bipartisan backing.

“Biden’s opening order was such an overreach that instead of opening negotiations, it just scared Republicans away,” said Brian Riedl, policy expert at the libertarian-leaning Manhattan Institute and a former GOP Senate aide. Riedl said Republicans may be open to a deal somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion but that Biden’s opening bid made that less likely. “The opening offer can be so extreme it can poison the well and push the other side away.”

While insisting that Biden’s preference is for a bipartisan deal, Psaki has repeatedly declined to rule out moving forward under special Senate rules that allow legislation to pass with a simple majority vote instead of the 60 votes normally required. That was how President Barack Obama enacted the Affordable Care Act and how Republicans passed their massive tax cut early in President Donald Trump’s first term. The procedure could allow Biden to pass his coronavirus relief package with only Democratic votes.

But the path forward under this so-called “budget reconciliation” process could be tricky. The Senate is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, giving Democrats control only because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast tie-breaking votes. That means any individual Democratic senator could hold the legislation up with an array of demands.

Also, Senate leaders thus far haven’t even been able to agree on a deal on how to operate the Senate with a 50-50 split, and they’re also still arguing over the timing and process for Trump’s impeachment trial. Both issues are emerging as impediments to Biden getting his Cabinet confirmed and also probably need to get resolved before the Senate could take up a relief bill.

Democrats in Congress and within the White House are split on how much time to devote to trying to strike a bipartisan deal before turning to budget reconciliation and leaving Republicans behind. Biden was vice president when Obama devoted many weeks to futile negotiations with Republicans over the Affordable Care Act, before finally passing the legislation without a single GOP vote. Biden was also involved in negotiations over the $787 billion stimulus bill Obama signed in February 2009 in the throes of the financial crisis. Many Democrats wanted a larger package at the time, but Republicans balked; subsequently, many economists have concluded that a larger stimulus bill would have helped the nation climb out of the Great Recession more quickly.

With that history in mind, budget reconciliation has emerged as the clear preference for many liberal Democrats, especially in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., suggested in a conversation with donors Thursday evening that she was open to advancing Biden’s proposal via the reconciliation process in coming weeks, according to a person familiar with her remarks. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to confirm the private comments, which were first reported by Punchbowl News.

House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., said he wasn’t aware of a final decision on how to proceed but that Democrats were wary of spending too much time negotiating with Republicans at a moment of urgency.

“To haggle over every little provision of Biden’s plan (with Republicans) might not be able to be done on a timely basis,” Yarmuth said.

Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of the New Democrat Coalition, noted that last year Republicans refused for months to pass any additional relief, after a spate of legislation in the spring, before finally agreeing to another bill in December.

“We can’t let that happen again,” DelBene said. “People need certainty and visibility going forward, and that’s why this package is so important.”",Republican opposition to Biden’s stimulus relief intensifies,www.pressherald.com
278,279,https://patch.com/us/across-america/it-can-happen-anybody-virus-claims-36-year-old-mom-10,"LEXINGTON, SC — To those who knew her best, Ashley Bennett was put on this world to be a mother.

""Her world circulated around her children,"" Bucknam said during a separate interview with WIS. ""She absolutely loved them.""

At 36, Bennett was a mother of 10 children, ranging in age from 18 years to 2 weeks old. Her older sister, Courtney Bucknam , described her to WLTX as ""amazing.""

Bennett was 34 weeks pregnant and preparing for the birth of her youngest child when she, her husband Darryl, and all their children tested positive for coronavirus.

Bucknam told WLTX that Bennett had a blood clot that led to a stroke. She was intubated and underwent surgery, but passed on January 8.

After an emergency delivery of daughter Eliza on Jan. 1, Bennett's children lost their mother to COVID-19 just seven days later.

""She was an amazing person,"" Bucknam told WLTX. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help offset expenses for Bennett's husband and kids.

""If we can learn anything from this, it's that COVID is so serious, and we need to truly take precautions because she was only 36. She had no underlying conditions, and she was gone basically within 10 days,"" Bucknam said. ""It can happen to anybody.""

As the weekend comes to a close, the United States has reached 25 million confirmed cases of coronavirus. Totals from Johns Hopkins University show the country reached the number late Sunday morning.

With about 4 percent of the world's population, the United States has accounted for about a quarter of the confirmed coronavirus cases across the globe.

Cases and deaths continue to climb, and one public health expert called the milestone an ""incredible scale of tragedy.""



It took the United States about nine months to hit 10 million cases — that milestone was passed on Nov. 8 — but a post-Thanksgiving surge prompted infections to climb at an unprecedented and overwhelming speed.

By the last day of 2020, just seven weeks later, the country had added another 10 million cases.

As the caseload climbs past 25 million, more states are reporting their first cases of the B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant that was first discovered — and now spreading — in the United Kingdom.

All athletic games and practices have been canceled indefinitely at the University of Michigan after the variant was found in five athletes. Washington state is among the other states to have reported its first variant cases in recent days.

In many areas, hospitals remain strained due to the virus.

An Associated Press analysis of federal hospital data shows that since November, the share of U.S. hospitals nearing the breaking point has doubled. More than 40 percent of Americans now live in areas running out of ICU space, with only 15 percent of beds still available.



In the White House, President Joe Biden is spending the first days of his presidency trying to get the virus under control and lessen the toll it's taking on pandemic-weary Americans.

On Friday, Biden signed two more executive orders aimed at curbing the economic damage inflicted by the coronavirus crisis and feeding those suffering from pandemic-induced hunger.



One of the orders calls for a 15 percent increase in benefits received by low-income students through the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer program. It also calls for expanded eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps.

""The American people can't afford to wait,"" Brian Deese, the National Economic Council director, said during a Friday news conference. ""And so many are hanging by a thread. They need help, and we are committed to doing everything we can to provide that help as quickly as possible.""

In Friday's actions, Biden also called for the Office of Personnel Management to develop recommendations to pay more federal employees at least $15 per hour.

Biden is moving with lightning speed to address the pandemic that has infected more than million Americans and claimed more than 415,000 lives in the United States.

Possibly among those hundreds of thousands was legendary broadcaster and talk show host Larry King, who died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 87 years old.

A statement issued by Ora Media, the company he helped found in 2012, did not specifically cite the cause of death for the Brooklyn native and longtime nationally syndicated radio host; however, he was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai last month after testing positive for coronavirus.

King, host of ""Larry King Live"" on CNN, conducted an estimated 50,000 on-air interviews, according to The Associated Press. He was an enduring on-air personality who set himself apart with the curiosity be brought to every interview.

Meanwhile, at least 150 National Guard members sent to Washington, D.C. to provide Inauguration Day security following the deadly Jan. 6 riot on the U.S. Capitol have tested positive for coronavirus, according to a report by Reuters.

In a statement to Reuters, the National Guard said it would not discuss the cases, though a source who spoke to the publication said as many as 200 guard members could be infected and that the number could very likely grow.

More than 25,000 National Guard members were deployed to D.C. in the days leading up to Biden's inaugural. About 7,000 are expected to remain in the city through the end of the month.

In the South, Texas is becoming the latest state to run out of coronavirus vaccines, according to a Times report.

Dr. Esmaeil Porsa, the chief executive of Harris Health System, which treats thousands of mostly uninsured patients, warned on Friday that its entire vaccine supply could be depleted by midday Saturday. 



The problem is not capability, he told the Times — it's availability.

Health officials in Texas and other states are struggling to get answers, growing desperate as inoculation sites cancel thousands of appointments due to long-anticipated vaccines that are suddenly in short supply.

In South Carolina, a hospital in Beaufort had to cancel 6,000 vaccine appointments after it received only 450 of the doses it had expected. In Hawaii, a Maui hospital canceled 5,000 first-dose appointments and placed 15,000 additional requests for appointments on hold, according to The Times.

In other news, Dr. Anthony Fauci is back.

In truth, the nation's leading infectious-diseases expert never really went away. But after enduring nearly a year of darts and undermining comments from now-former President Donald Trump, Fauci now speaks with the authority of the White House again.

During a news conference Thursday, he called it ""liberating"" to be backed by a science-friendly administration that has embraced his recommendations to battle COVID-19.

""One of the new things in this administration is, if you don't know the answer, don't guess,"" Fauci said in one pointed observation during a White House briefing. ""Just say you don't know the answer.""

Also in Washington, D.C., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday quietly changed its immunization guidelines, specifically targeting the second dose of the long-awaited coronavirus vaccine.

According to a New York Times report, the CDC altered guidance to allow those receiving the shot to switch from one vaccine to another in ""exceptional situations."" This means if someone received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, in some cases, they may be able to receive a second dose produced by another pharmaceutical company.

At least 839 deaths and 79,141 new cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States on Sunday as of 2 p.m. ET, according to a Washington Post database. The Post's reporting shows that over the past week, new daily cases fell 21.1 percent, new daily deaths fell 7.4 percent an COVID-19-related hospitalizations fell 9.3 percent.

Currently, 113,609 people are hospitalized with a coronavirus-related illness in the United States, according to the Covid Tracking Project.



As of Sunday, 42 states and U.S. territories remained above the positive testing rate recommended by the World Health Organization to safely reopen. To safely reopen, the WHO recommends states remain at 5 percent or lower for at least 14 days.

279,280,https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/edmontonians-rally-in-support-of-political-prisoners-held-in-belarus-1.5279617,"EDMONTON -- Belarusians in Edmonton joined in on Saturday as protests swept across Europe in support of political prisoners held in Belarus.

They also showed support for Russian opposition leader and politician Alexei Navalny, who was arrested last weekend after returning to Russia from Germany.

In Edmonton, demonstrators formed a chain of solidarity in Old Strathcona.

""There are about 200 political prisoners at this time in Belarus, and they have been detained without any valid reasons,"" said Anastacia Morozoea of Edmonton’s Belarusian community.

“It is unbelievable that in the 21st century in the middle of Europe, that it is happening. It is just unbelievable.”

Morozoea says many of the prisoners are held in inhumane conditions without proper access to medical care.

280,281,https://abc30.com/lauren-boebert-gun-lawmakers-with-guns-us-capitol/9944344/,"WASHINGTON -- Gun control advocate Eileen McCarron faced blowback last year when she quipped that newly elected Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert would be heading to Washington to lead the ""nut-job caucus.""Afterward, McCarron said she wondered if she had gone too far. But then she saw Boebert rail about the 2020 elections, demand to carry a handgun onto the House floor, and send incendiary tweets about 1776 ahead of the U.S. Capitol violence on Jan. 6 . Now, McCarron told ABC News, she thinks Boebert ""may actually be worse"" than she feared.""I think it's become clear she is a menace to our country,"" said McCarron, the president of Colorado Ceasefire.Boebert, 34, is just days into her first term as a member of Congress, and already the fast-talking, gun-toting tavern owner is proving to be a provocative and disruptive force -- a reputation she says she relishes.""I know I am exactly where I am supposed to be for this moment,"" Boebert told ABC News. ""I'm proud to be here. I'm not slowing down. I'm not backing down.""The Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol served as a signal event for the Donald Trump presidency, and it has proven both defining and perilous for some of his staunchest supporters -- of which Boebert is one. In the weeks since the attack, Boebert has faced suspicion from many of her new colleagues in Washington. She has endured death threats and a flood of ridicule on social media. And she has seen strong reactions from critics and even some supporters back home in Colorado.Some of Boebert's Colorado constituents hosted a rally calling for her expulsion from Congress last week. Democrats promoted an aggressive recruiting drive to field an opponent to run against her in 2022. And a group of 60 elected officials from the Western Colorado region Boebert represents wrote an open letter to congressional leaders calling for an investigation into Boebert's conduct during the Jan. 6 insurrection, which they described as ""irresponsible and reprehensible.""""We have heard overwhelmingly from our constituents, therefore her constituents, that there is deep concern about her actions leading up to and during the protests that turned into a violent and deadly mob,"" the letter said.Exactly what Boebert did leading up to and during the Capitol siege remains a subject of rumors, dispute and continued controversy.On the morning of the siege, Boebert tweeted, ""Today is 1776."" She was speaking on the House floor against certifying Arizona's election results as rioters swarmed the Capitol, saying ""The Constitution makes it necessary for me to object to this travesty."" And as extremists poured into the Capitol, she tweeted: ""The Speaker has been removed from the chambers.""Some of the most combustible claims leveled by her critics -- that she secretly gave reconnaissance tours of the Capitol to extremists, that her mother was a rioter, or that her tweet about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was intended to guide the mob -- appear to be entirely unsupported and have been met with sharp denials from Boebert herself.""We are getting death threats over these slanderous claims,"" Boebert told ABC News. ""This is complete malice. They know that this is not true and they are still running with it.""But there are reasons that the otherwise obscure freshman congresswoman has remained a focus of attention both in Washington and at home.One of the militants arrested for participating in the riot posted a photo online last week in which he posed in front of the restaurant Boebert owns in her hometown of Rifle, Colorado. Authorities said the man, Robert Gieswein, is aligned with a militia group known as the ""Three Percenters,"" which espouses anti-government and pro-gun views. The Southern Poverty Law Center says some members are dangerous ""anti-government extremists"" and the Anti-Defamation League has flagged members pushing white supremacist dogma Another image, taken at a pro-gun rally shortly after Boebert launched her campaign in 2019, showed her posing with local members of the Three Percenters, which was one of two organizations credited with providing security at the rally, according to published reports Photos of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol showed some participants waving the Three Percenters flag during the riot.In June, Boebert tweeted the provocative statement: ""I am the militia.""When asked about her views on anti-government militia groups, Boebert said their activity is sanctioned by the U.S. Constitution -- but she stopped short of offering a full-throated endorsement of their efforts. She said she doesn't know Robert Gieswein, the Colorado man who had posed in front of her restaurant and who was later charged with participating in the Capitol siege. She said the photos she has taken with Three Percenters should not be viewed as an endorsement of their actions.""Lots of people attend my campaign events,"" she said. ""I'm not affiliated with any groups. Lots of people come out. Lots of people take photos with me. I'm not vetting every person that comes to my events.""A recent FBI report notes that simply espousing anti-government rhetoric is not against the law, but that these types of militias represent a security threat because of their efforts to ""advance that ideology through force or violence,"" which is illegal.Boebert took to Twitter on Jan. 6 to condemn the attack on the Capitol, which has been proven to involve large numbers of militia members from around the country. And she refuted many of the claims circulated about her as false -- telling ABC News, for instance, that her mother did not participate in the siege and was locked in Boebert's office the entire time.Democrats have continued to question whether any Republican members took steps to aid the rioters. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Thursday that ""if people did aid and abet, there will be more than just comments from colleagues here -- there will be prosecutions.""""We should have a full investigation,"" said Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., adding that the conduct of members of Congress should ""absolutely"" be looked at by the FBI.Bryson Morgan, a former investigative counsel to the House Office of Congressional Ethics, said nothing revealed so far would indicate that Boebert could face discipline.""But we keep learning more and more about the events of Jan. 6,"" Morgan said. ""I would expect if a member was shown to be supporting an attack on the Capitol in any way, there would be swift action.""Groups that monitor militia activity said they are increasingly concerned by what they have been learning about Boebert. Scott Levin, director of the Colorado chapter of the Anti-Defamation League, said his group has not been able to tie Boebert directly to any extremist or hate groups -- but he said the events of Jan. 6 generated heightened suspicion.""The language she uses is something that people will take cues from, and that will empower them and embolden them to act,"" Levin said. ""And that's where the real danger is.""Back in Colorado, people in Boebert's district have been following her first days in Congress with a range of reactions. Boebert said she has received positive feedback from her constituents.""My supporters who sent me to Washington, D.C., are happy with me,"" she said. ""My base is growing.""Matt Scherr, a commissioner in Eagle County, said Boebert is probably correct that her conduct is not likely to siphon away support -- even though he was upset by it. He said he does believe she needs to conduct herself with more care, now that she holds elective office.""She is clearly passionate and a patriot,"" Scherr said. ""We were not calling for her resignation or for her to be expelled. But we would hope she learns from this and shows some contrition about what happened from the Capitol.""Others say they are increasingly concerned by what they see as combustible rhetoric.""I know she has a lot of supporters,"" said John Clark, the mayor of the town of Ridgway in Boebert's district.""I just know my friends and acquaintances aren't happy at all about what occurred on Jan. 6 and her ensuing behavior,"" Clark said. ""So many people are believing radical misinformation and it's really hard to convince them otherwise -- and unfortunately, Lauren Boebert is doing everything she can to spur them on.""","For GOP firebrand Rep.

282,283,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/01/23/roads-named-victoria-cross-heroes-latest-tory-plan-war-woke/,"New roads could be named after military and civilian heroes under plans backed by two Cabinet ministers in the latest salvo of the Conservatives' 'war on woke'.

Oliver Dowden, the Culture secretary and Robert Jenrick, the Communities secretary, are backing a plan put forward by a group of Tory backbenchers for new streets to be named in honour of holders of the Victoria Cross and the George Cross.

The group called the Common Sense group of Conservative MPs also wants new statues erected in parks in places where the holders were born.

It comes after Mr Jenrick last week unveiled plans in the Telegraph to change the law to give formal legal protections to 12,000 historical statues in England for the first time and to stop some of them being pulled down by “baying mobs”.

Last December, Birmingham City Council was accused of ‘virtue signalling’ after it gave six new streets 'woke' names to roads in Perry Barr: Diversity Grove, Equality Road, Destiny Road, Inspire Avenue, Respect Way and Humanity Close.

Some existing roads are already being renamed by local councils because of a nervousness about Britain's imperial past. The campaign group Save Our Statues estimates that nearly 200 streets are under threat.

In total, 1,358 individuals have been awarded the Victoria Cross for valour ‘in the presence of the enemy’, whilst 408 men and women have received the George Cross after displaying conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme danger.

Sir John Hayes, the chairman of the Common Sense Group, last week sent a letter signed by over 20 Tory MPs including James Sunderland, Tom Hunt and Pauline Latham urging for communities to celebrate the achievements of their forebears with new statues, memorials and roads named after them.

The group said: ""Tragically, too many who have given and achieved so much have been all but forgotten; their names and identities detached from the villages, towns and cities throughout our country in which they were raised.

""In many places, locals may be unaware that they tread in the footsteps of heroes. Which is why the Common Sense Group has launched a campaign to honour every recipient of the VC and GC through the erection of a statue, immortalising them in their place of birth.

""Where this is not practically possible, these heroes could be recognised by a plaque, or have a public building, park or road named or renamed after them.

""Such a powerful and enduring tribute would play a part in bringing people together after a year of great challenge and struggle, enabling us to make the most of the best of our history, so inspiring and informing generations to come.""

Mr Dowden, who is in charge of preserving heritage in this country, is planning to meet the group to take forward the plan.

He told The Telegraph: “Celebrating the history of the places where we live and the men and women who shaped them builds a sense of pride in our communities.

""It is important that we recognise the diverse contributions of everyone who has shaped our nation. I look forward to discussing these ideas further with the group.”

Mr Jenrick said he will be writing to the chairman of Homes England, which last year sold enough Government land for 6,000 new homes, urging him to look at the plan.

A source close to Mr Jenrick also said he would be writing to councils urging them to consider the plan and other ways to celebrate people who served their communities. The source likened the idea to the gold Royal Mail post boxes which were decorated near the homes of athletes who won gold medals at the 2012 Olympics.

Sir John said on Saturday: “Almost every day local authorities are deciding upon the names of new roads.

“There was a time when they chose to honour their heroes in road and place names, and the names of parks and buildings.

“It is time to do again - it will bring the country together by reinforcing our sense of place and our shared sense of belonging.”

Mr Jenrick wants to amend rules so that existing road names can only be renamed if a clear majority of residents want it to happen.",Roads to be named after Victoria Cross heroes in latest Tory plan for 'war on woke',www.telegraph.co.uk

Despite the glitch in the system that caused them to overbook, health officials still administered 5,451 doses of the vaccine that day.""It's a large operation. There might be glitches every now and then, but I assure you vaccinations are not sitting on shelves,"" said Turner.During Saturday's briefing, Turner said about 900 people were sent home last weekend. He also said about 550 of those received the vaccine on Friday, and between Saturday and next week, the rest will be given the shot.On Friday, the city received about 9,000 new doses to be administered next week, according to the mayor.Since then, the Houston Health Department announced it opened 1,600 new COVID-19 vaccination appointment slots for the week of Jan. 25. The appointments were for first doses only, and only those who fell under Phase 1A or 1B of the state's vaccination criteria qualified to receive a dose. All slots were full within about ten minutes of the registration portal opening up, according to Houston Health.The health department said on Friday that appointments were only confirmed upon receipt of an email or text message, and confirmation numbers would be verified on site.The new appointments are for the department's new drive-thru vaccination site at Delmar Stadium. The site, operated by United Memorial Medical Center, is slated to open on Monday.People who show up without confirmed appointments will be turned away, city officials said.In addition, Stephen L. Williams, the director at the Houston Health Department, said during Saturday's briefing that a partnership with the Hope Clinic on the southwest side of Houston will start next week.""We want to ensure that neighborhoods where there are challenges related to access, related to transportation, that we actually have sites within those neighborhoods so that people can in fact get the vaccine,"" said Williams.Turner said they are also preparing to set up additional sites based on the availability of the supply.""If there is not a site near you, it's not because we don't want to,"" he said.If the shipments of 8,000 to 9,000 doses per week increase, he said they will ""be prepared to push out more and quickly open up those additional sites,"" as the Biden administration works to ramp up the vaccine production.He also reminded people that those weekly doses are not only limited to the city of Houston.""When we open that portal, you have people from Harris County, they could be coming from Fort Bend County, Galveston, Montgomery County,"" he said.

285,286,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-idINKBN29S0J9,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is closely watching the more infectious variant of COVID-19 after British officials warned that it may also be more deadly, two top U.S. health officials said on Saturday, cautioning more data is needed.

Officials are somewhat more worried about a separate variant from South Africa, although it has not yet been identified among U.S. cases of the novel coronavirus, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins and Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s top COVID-19 medical adviser, also said.

Collins noted the UK’s data was preliminary, and said it was unclear why those with the UK variant faced a higher risk of death, whether by changes in the virus itself or other external causes such as pressures on the healthcare system.

“Let’s take this as something to watch closely,” he told MSNBC in an interview.

Fauci separately told MSNBC that he needed to see the raw data from the UK before fully assessing the mortality risk and that U.S. officials were weighing how the two new strains could impact vaccine efficacy.

“These are serious situations that we are following very closely and, if necessary, we will adapt to it,” Fauci said, adding vaccines could be altered in coming months if needed.

Their comments come as Democratic President Joe Biden takes the reins of the nation’s COVID-19 response, seeking to re-energize the fight against the highly infectious disease and urging a war-like stance. In a flurry of actions since taking office Wednesday, Biden unveiled a new U.S. strategic plan to curtail the outbreak and signed numerous executive orders to boost vaccines and increase mask use, among other measures.

The United States is the nation hardest-hit by COVID-19, with 24.70 million cases and 413,775 deaths by midnight Friday. Over the past week, 3,089 Americans have died of the disease on average, while 20 U.S. states reported record deaths this month.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday warned that the UK variant was associated with higher level of mortality.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week warned the UK variant, already circulating in at least 10 U.S. states, could become the dominant variant in the United States by March. The variant, known as B.1.1.7, is believed to be twice as contagious as the current one circulating nationwide.

“At the moment we are not alarmed about that,” Collins said, given that vaccines still appeared effective against it. “We are somewhat more concerned about a South African variant.”

Fauci, U.S. top infectious disease expert, echoed his concerns, calling data on the South Africa variant a bit more “ominous” even as current vaccines still appeared to protect against both variants.

Scientists on Wednesday said the South African variant may reduce the efficacy of current vaccines, which also raises the prospect of re-infection.

Britain has banned travelers from some African countries in an attempt to stop the spread of that strain in the United Kingdom and is weighing further restrictions.

Biden has moved to impose a mandatory quarantine for air passengers arriving in the United States, although details have not yet been released. He is also requiring U.S.-bound passengers to have a negative COVID-19 test starting on Tuesday.

Even without a greater mortality risk, more contagious variants increase the pressure on officials to vaccinate the population -- a campaign many state and local officials have said has been slow and chaotic and one Biden has pledged to improve.

“When you get more cases, you’re going to get more hospitalizations. And when you get more hospitalizations, you’re ultimately going to get more deaths,” Fauci told reporters at the White House on Thursday.",health officials: More data needed on UK COVID-19 variant warning,www.reuters.com

The mercury is expected to reach as high as 45C in South Australia while most of the country's southeast will sweat through the mid-to-high 30s on Sunday.

Bureau of Meteorology's Jonathan How said conditions in the southeast over the weekend would be the warmest since January 2020.

'Sunday will be the peak day of heat in South Australia, climbing as high as 45C along the Murray,' he said.

'On Monday, Victoria and Tasmania will see the most intense heat, reaching 41C in Melbourne and 33C in Hobart.'

Sydneysiders were quick to hit the beaches as the mercury peaked at 30C on Saturday.

The hot weather has continued with a maximum of 33C expected on Sunday, 31C on Monday and back to 33C for Tuesday's public holiday.

Western Sydney will bear the brunt of the heatwave with temperatures skyrocketing to 39C on Sunday.

The conditions are not expected to cool until at least Tuesday.

Bega, on the state's south coast, is expected to reach at least 39C on Monday and NSW-Victoria border towns could endure temperatures up to 44C.

Victoria will also see temperatures building to a peak on Monday, with most major centres in the state's north surpassing 40C.

Melbourne will reach a high of 34C on Sunday and peak at a scorching 41C on Monday.

A severe to extreme heatwave has already beset southwest Western Australia and western South Australia.

Adelaide will reach a sizzling 41C on Sunday and taper off to 34C on Monday with a low intensity heatwave is expected to persist in SA until next week.

In Hobart, the maximum will be a cooler 26C on Sunday and peak at 34C on Monday.

Canberra will face temperatures of 30C and above from Sunday to Wednesday.

The maximum will be 38C on Sunday and Monday, 35C on Tuesday and 30C on Wednesday - with sunny skies persisting the whole time, although there is the chance of a possible shower on Wednesday.

Mr How said the high temperatures will create 'uncomfortably warm nights, making it difficult to recover from hot days'.

'Heatwaves are normal for summer but they effect everyone differently, it's important to look out for the more vulnerable, including pets and local wildlife,' he said.

'This weekend, remember to factor in the heat and any fire weather warnings, stay up to day with the forecast, stay up to date, stay hydrated and stay safe.'

Temperatures in Brisbane will be much more mild with a maximum of 29C on Sunday, with the pleasant weather to continue until Tuesday.

Meanwhile on the west coast, Perth will reach a maximum of 26C on Sunday and Monday, and back up to 28C for Tuesday.

In the Top End, Darwin will reach a maximum of 31C on Sunday, which is expected to stay the same until Wednesday, when it will increase to 32C.

The director of the care home did not return calls from CBC News on Saturday.

Manoir Belle Vue has 61 beds, according to provincial inspection reports.

The home is part of a larger complex with three other units — La Maison, le Pavillion and le Château.

Public Health has also declared an outbreak at Le Pavillon Le Royer, another long-term care home in Edmundston, and Foyer Ste-Elizabeth in nearby Baker Brook.

294,295,https://www.rfi.fr/en/johnson-biden-discuss-deepening-alliance-pm-s-office,"Boris Johnson and Joe Biden on Saturday vowed to deepen ties and cooperate on tackling climate change in their first conversation since the US president's inauguration, the British prime minister's office said.

Johnson congratulated Biden on his inauguration and ""the two leaders looked forward to deepening the close alliance between our nations"", said the statement from Downing Street.

British newspapers reported that Johnson was the first European leader to receive a call from Biden, who earlier spoke to Canadian and Mexican counterparts.

The right-wing Sunday Telegraph reported that Johnson was the first leader outside North America to speak to Biden ""after his scheduled call was brought forward two days in what will be seen as a major boost for the special relationship between the UK and US.""

Biden on Friday spoke to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in his first call to a foreign leader.

Johnson tweeted a picture of himself in shirt-sleeves laughing as he spoke on the phone. ""Great to speak to President @JoeBiden this evening,"" he wrote.

The conversation appeared aimed at warming frosty relations after Biden in 2019 described Johnson as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Donald Trump, his predecessor as US president.

Biden has also been critical of Johnson's Brexit policy, but the Downing Street statement said the leaders ""discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries"".

Johnson said he intended to resolve current trade issues ""as soon as possible"".

Biden, who has Irish roots, had warned ahead of his election that if Brexit damaged the 1998 Good Friday Agreement he would not consent to a trade deal. That agreement ended 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.

Johnson praised Biden for swiftly reversing policy decisions made by his predecessor.

He ""warmly welcomed"" Biden's decision to put the United States back into the Paris climate accord and rejoin the World Health Organization. The prime minister also praised Biden's commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

The leaders said they hoped to meet soon and would work together on the United Nations' global climate change summit to be held in Scotland in November, said the statement.

The leaders ""re-committed to the NATO alliance"" and ""shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy"", it added. Trump was highly critical of the transatlantic alliance.

The leaders also agreed on the ""significant challenges facing the world during the pandemic"".

The United States has the largest number of cases and deaths in the world, while the UK has the highest number of deaths in Europe.

The leaders said the pandemic nevertheless created ""unparalleled opportunities to build back better and greener together"".

Johnson also praised Biden for joining the Covax initiative, a global pool of coronavirus vaccine doses for poorer nations.","Johnson, Biden discuss 'deepening alliance': PM's office",www.rfi.fr
295,296,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/531562/Wuhan-marks-one-year-since-lockdown-over-corona,"WUHAN: The Chinese city of Wuhan marked one year since the start of its traumatic 76-day coronavirus lockdown on Saturday while the pandemic continued to rage elsewhere, reports AFP.

Traffic hummed, sidewalks bustled, and citizens packed parks and public transport in Wuhan, underscoring the scale of the recovery in the metropolis of 11 million where the pathogen first emerged before going global.

“In addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant... may be associated with a higher degree of mortality,” Johnson told a news conference.

The sobering news came as Britain reported record deaths from Covid-19, following a surge in cases and hospitalisations since the variant was first identified in southeast England in September.

The nation’s death toll -- 95,981 as of Friday—is the highest in Europe.

In the United States, the world’s worst-hit country, the new president gave his highest estimate yet of its eventual toll, as he stepped up federal aid.

Globally, the virus has killed more than two million people, infected tens of millions of others and hammered economies.

“All hypotheses are on the table,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference in Geneva. “And it is definitely too early to come to a conclusion of exactly where this virus started, either within or without China.”

Beijing is braced for the scrutiny the team will bring to its virus narrative, having drip-fed the idea that the pandemic started outside its borders.

And while Wuhanites looked back on their confinement from the distance of a year, Hong Kong was introducing its first lockdown of the pandemic, the government ordering thousands of residents to stay home as authorities battled an outbreak in one of its poorest and most densely packed districts.

The order bans anyone inside multiple housing blocks within the neighbourhood of Jordan—about 150 blocks and up to 9,000 people, according to local media—from leaving their apartment unless they can show a negative test.

Countries across the world were bringing in new measures Saturday, including the Netherlands, which was set to introduce its first curfew since World War II.

Until February 19, residents will have to stay home from 9 pm until 4:30 am, on pain of a 95-euro ($115) fine.

And in the Colombian capital of Bogota, residents were under their third weekend quarantine in a row, meaning the closure of all non-essential shops in the city of eight million from Friday at 8:00 pm until Monday at 4:00 am.

As vaccine rollouts gain pace around the world, Hungary announced it was going it alone and buying two million doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, frustrated by the European Union’s unwieldy strategy of buying shots in bulk on behalf of members.

“It doesn’t matter if the cat is black or white, as long as it catches the mouse,” Orban said of the different vaccines, despite wariness from some experts over Sputnik V being rolled out before large-scale clinical trials.

Brazil was meanwhile due to receive two million doses of a different jab developed by British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca and Oxford University.

The WHO has repeatedly warned that richer countries are hogging vaccines.

But there was good news Friday for poorer nations, as the WHO and pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer announced a deal for up to 40 million initial doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be made available to them through the Covax global pool.

“We can only end the pandemic anywhere if we end it everywhere,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

A separate deal, brokered by international agencies working with the WHO, will supply developing nations with tens of millions of rapid antigen tests at half the usual $5 price.",Wuhan marks one year since lockdown over corona | daily sun,www.daily-sun.com
296,297,https://www.grandforksherald.com/community/events/6854742-March-for-Life-takes-action-in-Crookston,"Marie Kraemer, 18, is glad to be alive -- and, for her, the annual March for Life, to commemorate lives lost to abortion, is personal.

“I was born in China during the time of the one-child policy,” said Kraemer, who helped organize the march on Saturday, Jan. 23, in Crookston. “I could have been someone who could’ve been aborted, so (the march) means a lot to me.”

About 100 people of all ages participated in the march, which began with a prayer at 1:30 p.m. at Central Park. Participants walked, while chanting and braving bitter winds, several blocks to the Polk County Courthouse, where prayers were recited. All the prayers on this occasion were led by teenagers.

The event was organized by the St. Joseph Holy Family Homeschool support group, Lee Walski, of Crookston, announced at the start of the march.

Marie Kraemer, 18, was abandoned by her birth mother and taken to an orphanage in China, she said. She is grateful that her birth mother did not choose abortion, in the face of pressure from the Chinese government, she said.

At age 13 months, she was adopted by Laurie and Phil Kraemer, of Grand Forks, who raised her and another adopted Chinese girl, along with five biological children, she said.

“Every day of my life has been a gift. I feel so grateful that I am able to live the life that God wanted me to have,"" she said.

A student at Lake Region State College, a junior college, she plans to transfer to the University of Minnesota Crookston to study equine science, according to Kraemer, who has attended the March for Life twice in Washington, D.C.

“It was eye-opening, honestly, to see groups from all over the United States, seeing everyone there, thousands and thousands,” she said. “It was very peaceful. Really cool.”

Before the event, she was excited when she heard that people from around the region planned to attend the march in Crookston, according to Kraemer, who credits Mary Kennelly, a member of a local home-school group, for getting the ball rolling.

“She said we should really do something this year,” Kraemer said, noting that this is the first such march that’s been held in Crookston.

“We need to stand up for all lives, instead of just some lives,” she said. “I believe the baby’s life starts from the moment of conception, so to be able to stand up for those lives, it really matters. They don’t have a voice.”

At the event on Saturday, Joseph Vandal, 15, of Minto, N.D., led the procession, holding a staff with a gold crucifix atop. He was followed by Nathan Walski, 16, of Crookston, who held up the U.S. flag.

“I believe life is a right, not a choice of other people,” said Vandal, a high school freshman, adding that he has participated in other similar pro-life events in Fargo in the past.

Joey Walski, 14, has never attended a March for Life rally, he said.

“I was going to go to the March for Life in Washington, D.C., but the group we usually go with was not going to go this year,"" said Walski, noting that the corresponding event in the nation’s capital is taking place on a much smaller scale than in years past.

Joey Walski said he feels strongly enough about the abortion issue to take part in Saturday’s event in Crookston, which his mother, Lee Walski, coordinated.

“I think someone needs to speak out for the babies who cannot speak out for themselves,” said Joey Walski, an eighth-grade, home-schooled student.

As they walked through the streets, participants were escorted by the Crookston Police Department vehicles, with flashing red and blue lights, up North Ash Street and through residential areas to the courthouse parking lot. They chanted, in response to the lead speaker, the Litany of the Holy Face of Jesus and repetitions of the “Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee…” prayer. They also recited the Lord’s Prayer in unison.

Four men carried a raised platform with a white statue of the Virgin Mary.

The crowd included people of all ages, some pushing baby strollers and others carrying signs with messages, such as “Please Let Baby Live,” “Choose Love, Choose Life,” “Remember the Unborn” and “Pray to End Abortion.”

The group walked back to its starting point in Central Park, ending with the song, “God Bless America.”",March for Life takes action in Crookston,www.grandforksherald.com
297,298,https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/world-doesnt-realise-already-war-china,"India is a prime target for PRC’s political warfare. The PRC’s full political warfare force will be directed at weakening India, from funding NGOs in the US to (possibly) funding mobs to attack a Taiwanese manufacturing plant in Bengaluru.

The People’s Republic of China (PRC) was born out of a bloody civil war, won by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). For the CCP, the war to expand its depth and zones of control and influence never ended. It continues to attack resistance to its goals, at home and abroad, using a range of means.

Sometimes the CCP uses “kinetic” warfare—as with India in 1962—but always, since the start, it has waged political warfare. And the CCP is very, very good at political warfare. Meanwhile, much of the rest of the world not only isn’t fighting back, it doesn’t even realise it is at war.

What that means has been vividly and expertly described in an essential new book, Political Warfare: Strategies for Combating China’s Plan to “Win without Fighting” by Kerry K. Gershaneck. Prof. Gershaneck combines the perspectives of a scholar and a warrior. He worked at universities and think tanks across the Indo-Pacific, and is currently a Taiwan Fellow at National Chengchi University, Taiwan. He is also a former US Marine Corps officer, with extensive operational and intelligence and counterintelligence experience.

The book, available for free from the Marine Corps University Press, provides the mental equivalent of physical boot camp training—it introduces you to the fight and teaches you the tactics and the strategies needed to defend yourself, and hopefully win. If you think the fight doesn’t involve you, the book shows you why you are already in the ring, and likely losing.

So, what is PRC political warfare? There are many elements to it but it is essentially “all-encompassing, unrestricted warfare”. Everything just this side of a straight-up shooting war. But make no mistake, it is war just the same. The goal is to defeat the enemy, and subject it to your will. According to the book, the “PRC considers itself engaged in a political war with the United States and its partner nations and allies. Failure to understand the nature of this war severely undermines the ability to conceptualize the threat and to implement appropriate countermeasures. This failure ensures ultimate defeat.”

Some of the elements of CCP political warfare described in the book are: lawfare (using international and national laws, bodies and courts to shape decision making in the CCP’s favour), economic warfare, biological and chemical warfare, cyberattacks, terrorism, public opinion/media warfare, psychological warfare, espionage, bribery, censorship, deception, subversion, blackmail, “enforced disappearances”, street violence, assassination, use of proxy forces, public diplomacy, and hybrid warfare.

The book explains that accurate terminology is important to understand what you are facing, and so have a chance at defeating it. In that context, it explains the “PRC is a coercive, expansionist, hyper-nationalistic, militarily powerful, brutally repressive, fascist, and totalitarian state.”

If that makes you uncomfortable, the CCP is already in your head. One of the elements of CCP political warfare is to get people to self-censor out of fear of “offending” a billion Chinese. However, objectively, that description is completely accurate. The book even quotes Merriam-Webster dictionary’s definitions to prove the point.

Totalitarianism: “centralized control by an autocratic authority; the political concept that the citizen should be totally subject to an absolute state authority.” Fascism: “a political philosophy, movement, or regime that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition; a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control.”

So, yes, the PRC as run by the CCP is fascist and totalitarian. And they are the ones subjecting a billion Chinese to offense at a very fundamental level.

This lesson in intellectual self-defence is important. It is imperative to use accurate words. If you don’t, as the book says, “it allows the PRC’s apologists and defenders to assert the ‘moral equivalence’ defense of China’s political warfare that the author has heard repeatedly: ‘Every country does it. So what?’ The ‘so what’ is that the PRC is a fascist, totalitarian existential threat.”

The book, drawing on a wide range of sources and interviews, details how the PRC’s political warfare is highly structured, complex, and embedded across systems. It has had decades to mature and refine, growing and expanding with new technologies and techniques. Xi Jinping’s father, Xi Zhongxun, was involved with political warfare operations for much of his career.

It is also well funded. In 2015, the budget for influence operations alone was estimated at $10 billion, and has only increased since then. So it’s less surprising that Stanford University “received $32,244,826 in monetary gifts from China” during six years, and Harvard “received $55,065,261 through a combination of contracts and monetary gifts.”

Some of the traits of PRC political warfare:
• A “clear vision, ideology, and strategy” for the employment of political warfare.
• The employment of overt and covert means to influence, coerce, intimidate, divide, and subvert rival countries to force their compliance or collapse.
• A thorough understanding of rival nations being targeted by political warfare.
• The use of a comprehensive array of political warfare tools in coordinated actions.
• A willingness to accept high levels of risk resulting from the exposure of political warfare activities.

In just one example of an element of PRC political warfare capabilities, the book explains: “The CCP has long employed propaganda and disinformation against its enemies, but in recent years it has found a ‘fertile information environment’ in the new world of social media to ‘amplify its time-honed tactics of political and psychological warfare.’ The added benefit of using social media to flood its adversaries’ societies with propaganda and disinformation is that it ultimately weakens people’s faith in democracy and can create political instability. In pursuit of social media dominance, the PRC has established PLA cyber force of as many as 300,000 soldiers as well as a netizen ‘50 Cent Army’ of perhaps 2 million individuals who ‘are paid a nominal fee to make comments on social media sites in favor of [CCP] propaganda.’”

The Chinese people are one of the prime targets of CCP political warfare. Domestically, the CCP has tentacle into every aspect of life, including via the social credit scheme, Great Firewall and dedicated bureaus to (among many others): cultivate political support of the Chinese middle class; look after ideological and disciplinary matters; implement policy concerning departing/retired personnel; and liaises with Chinese intellectuals.

The book includes two case studies of the PRC’s political warfare targets, one on Taiwan and one on Thailand. They show that anyone wanting to work with, or in, another country needs to take stock of the effectiveness of PRC political warfare in that country if they are going to be successful. Businesses getting involved in China might understand they need to know how Beijing operates, but what the studies show is that anyone who wants to work with Thailand also needs to understand Beijing given the degree of influence it now wields in Bangkok.

From 2013 through 2018, Prof. Gershaneck was the Distinguished Visiting Professor at Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy in Thailand. China spent decades waging political warfare in Thailand, including using intimidation, kidnapping, bribery, working through surrogates, backing insurgents, blackmail, extortion, coopting/manipulating/buying local media, infiltrating education systems, high level visits, cyber infiltration, and social media manipulation.
• The PRC is a nonthreat and a noncompetitor, but rather a partner in economic growth, to Thailand.
• The Chinese and Thai people are more than mere friends—they are as close as family.
• The PRC is strong, while the United States is weak and undependable.

“Asia is for Asians,” as exemplified by the PRC, while archaic western values do not apply in the region.
• The political and economic policies of the “China Model” should be adopted by Thailand as a “Thai Model.”

Over decades, the country was “softened up” by PRC political warfare. Then, the US badly mismanaged its response to the 2014 coup (PRC political warfare effectiveness is often aided by missteps by others, including the US). The result was by 2017 “the majority of Thai military officers perceived the PRC, not the United States, to be Thailand’s most useful and reliable ally.”

That’s how the PRC wins without fighting.

WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT?

A major problem is, according to the book, when the Cold War ended, the US shut down its capabilities to fight political warfare, or even to consistently identify it. The Departments of Defense and State, academia, the military academies, none focus on political warfare.

While the book’s recommendations are geared for a US audience, the recommendations apply to any nation willing to try to defend itself. They include:
• Use accurate terms and identify the PRC threat by its rightful name, political warfare.
• Develop better analytical, investigative, and legal training for those with these responsibilities to screen, track, and expose political warfare activities.
• Take legal action against PRC officials and affiliates engaged in civil rights offenses.
• Encourage academic study that focuses on combating PRC political warfare (the book even includes an outline for a five day course on identifying and combating political warfare).

India is a prime target for PRC’s political warfare. New Delhi has made some inspired moves at self-defence, such as banning Chinese apps. But the attacks will keep coming, especially if India looks like it might displace China in supply chains and become a security provider for the Indo-Pacific. The PRC’s full political warfare force will be directed at weakening India, from funding NGOs in the US to (possibly) funding mobs to attack a Taiwanese manufacturing plant in Bengaluru.

Perhaps something India would like to consider is the book’s recommendation to establish an Asian political warfare centre of excellence “To develop a common understanding of PRC political warfare threats and promote the development of a comprehensive, whole-of-government response at national levels in countering PRC and other political warfare threats.”

This could include “Discussions among like-minded nations, investigate political warfare operations directed at democracies, training and scenario exercises, research and analysis into countering PRC political warfare, etc, Typical participants would be practitioners, scholars, policymakers, [parliamentary] staff, journalists, strategists, campaign planners, legal specialists, and selected civil servants as well as foreign service, military, intelligence, and law enforcement officers.”

Currently, China is facing little resistance to its political warfare and its goal to “win without fighting”. The rest of the free world now has to decide if it is willing to lose without fighting. If not, this book goes a long way towards building the plan to fight back.

He would do well to bear in mind these words from Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative committee chairman: “Companies listed in London should expect to be scrutinised according to the values we hold, not those of a foreign dictatorship.”

It follows that HSBC’s business today appears as a towering, teetering hypocrisy.

At one end it is the fourth most valuable company listed in London, a financial market taking the ethical responsibilities of companies increasingly seriously. It provides tens of billions of pounds of mortgage lending to Britons every year under the slogan “together we thrive”.

Quinn promotes the bank’s commitment to improving its diversity and developing the careers of its black and ethnic minority staff.

At the other end, HSBC aligns itself with a regime accused by the United States of genocide. It shuts down the accounts of Hong Kongers who inconvenience Beijing by exercising their rights, and faces questions over whether it sometimes does this voluntarily or only on orders.

The presence of many CCP members in HSBC’s upper ranks may make the distinction impossible to draw. The bank has lobbied Downing Street against angering China. In the United States it was among the multinationals that opposed legislation prohibiting goods made with forced labour in Xinjiang.

Quinn must be prepared to answer to all of this. As the Westminster debate over genocide against the Uighurs continues, ministers are following the US with steps “to prevent British commercial engagement with goods that are made by forced labour in Xinjiang”. Does HSBC oppose that too?

As Quinn said in response to last year’s Black Lives Matter protests: “Saying the right words is easy. Doing the right thing is harder.”

Too true, as the Uighurs know too well. The West is in the midst of a reckoning over China.

Britain’s self-serving hopes that forging a partnership with Beijing would help freedom take root have evaporated. The CCP is instead building the world’s first hi-tech prison state.

As geopolitics shift to account for this reality, the financial system must be reshaped. HSBC should admit it and get ready for a break-up.",HSBC cannot stay silent as China’s crimes are exposed,www.telegraph.co.uk

The 84-year-old will still go ahead with the Angelus blessing at noon on Sunday, but he will not deliver Mass, nor evening prayer, at St Paul's Basilica. A meeting with the diplomatic corps to the Holy See on Monday will also be rescheduled.

These three events will not see the pope's participation ""due to a recurrence of sciatica,"" Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said on Saturday evening.

Sciatica, a form of pain caused by something pressing the sciatic nerve, can affect a person's lower back, through to their legs. It is often caused by a slipped disc in the spine.

This is not the first time Francis has cancelled appearances due to nerve pain - he was forced to skip New Year's ceremonies a few weeks ago due to a flareup, prompting concern about an upcoming international trip.

The pope is due to visit Iraq between March 3 and 8 - but such visits are tiring under any circumstances, with many appointments each day, along with long Masses and reception lines, and multiple transfers via car and plane.

Condon, a young editorial assistant at the school's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, had been foraging around a dusty corner of storage with two colleagues that day. Amid the clutter of items little used in displays, she'd stopped at a wooden cabinet. Someone had pushed it under an eave.

Inside, she noticed a group of flat leather cases, each a little bigger than a deck of cards. Condon called over Elinor Reichlin, the museum’s registrar.

She grasped a case and unlocked its tiny latch. With that simple flip, they released a genie of history, a long-lost story of humanity and inhumanity that stretched from the esteemed halls of Harvard to the dirt and bolls of South Carolina's cotton plantations.

None of them knew this yet.

Each of the 15 identical cases contained a daguerreotype, an early form of photography from the mid-1800s. Beneath glass and faux-gold frames, a lone Black person stared into the camera, stony-faced and resolute, except one young woman whose eyes appeared blurred with tears.

All of the people, photographed portrait-style and beautifully lit, were partially or entirely naked.

Most were middle-aged or older men. Two were women who sat in fluffy antebellum dresses, hands clasped in their laps, dress tops pulled down to fully expose their breasts.

In other images, men stood fully nude, barefoot on a handsome rug in front of a wooden stool. Each was photographed facing front, then from the side, then from behind.

They didn’t appear undressed for pornographic purposes. The pictures felt oddly clinical.

What on earth were these?

Nothing in the drawer explained what they'd discovered. Only small, handwritten labels affixed to each offered clues:

One of the researchers rushed downstairs to summon their colleagues.

The discovery sent Reichlin and others on a quest to solve the disturbing mystery. It continues today, 45 years later.

But Harvard historians weren't the only ones hunting for clues. In 2019, a woman named Tamara Lanier sued the university for possession of the daguerreotypes. Based on her own research, she claimed to be a descendant of two people captured in them.

The complaint, filed by an attorney who handles high-profile civil rights cases, cast its demands in sweeping terms: “The story of this case spans 175 years. It is a story about opportunism, greed, and profound moral abdication by one of the country’s most revered educational institutions.”

So many years after slavery's end, not unlike in the aftermath of wars or colonization, the question remains: Who has rights to the plunder of the most egregious wrongs?

The story began, in many ways, in 1846 when a famous Swiss scientist named Louis Agassiz immigrated to the United States. He'd been invited to give a series of lectures in Boston, and to the elation of many, had accepted.

The 39-year-old was known for his groundbreaking method of classifying animals. At just 22, he’d published a tremendous study of Brazilian fish in which he had drawn and arranged in order more than 500 species. He’d since written copious books and articles about all manner of scientific topics, further boosting his profile.

Shortly after arriving in Boston, Agassiz decided to take a quick jaunt to Philadelphia to meet another lover of classifications. Samuel Morton, a physician and craniologist there, had amassed perhaps the world's largest collection of skulls.

The men hit it off. During his visit, Agassiz admired the vast collection; Morton explained some of his ideas.

Saying his measurements of human skulls proved Caucasians had the largest cranial capacity, Morton surmised this must prove they were the most intelligent race. He also claimed to have measured the smallest cranial capacity in Africans, which he argued meant they had the lowest intelligence.

Then he added something else: The races must, therefore, have derived from different origins — not a common one.

The idea, called polygenesis, intrigued Agassiz. A European, he'd never been immersed in American racism or its vast institution of slavery.

His thoughts buzzed as he bid Morton farewell and headed to his hotel.

When he arrived, he noticed the hotel's domestic staff were Black. So were those who served his meal. He was repulsed by them.

He later wrote to his mother about the interaction.

""I experienced pity at the sight of this degraded and degenerate race, and their lot inspired compassion in me in thinking that they are really men. Nonetheless, it is impossible for me to repress the feeling that they are not of the same blood as us.”

When he returned to work in Boston, he continued lecturing and researching, joined elite social circles and became increasingly influential.

The following year, Harvard received a $50,000 donation, worth about $1.7 million today, from textile magnate Abbott Lawrence, a man whose wealth depended on Southern cotton plantations. The windfall allowed the university to create a scientific school — with Agassiz soon at its helm.

He had become an American celebrity.

Despite his interest in polygenesis, race wasn't Agassiz's top issue then, said Molly Rogers, an Agassiz researcher and author of “Delia’s Tears: Race, Science, and Photography in Nineteenth-Century America.”

He and many other scientists were focused on explaining the natural world through creationism. A decade remained before Charles Darwin's ""Origin of Species"" would introduce the theory that populations evolve over time through natural selection.

Agassiz, a minister’s son, believed God had created different plants and animals specifically to live in their “zoological provinces,” or areas of the world.

But to say that human beings had different origins?

When Agassiz uttered the idea, Boston clergy attacked him. The Bible describes one Adam and Eve who gave rise to all people. Polygenesis rang sacrilegious.

In response, to preserve his academic and social stations, Agassiz modulated what he said — until 1850. That spring, he headed south to Charleston, land of plantation slavery.

Agassiz arrived in March, when the weather warmed and azaleas began to bloom. But he arrived to a tempest.

Scientists from around the country flocked to Charleston for the third meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The main topic: the unity or diversity of species.

Its key speaker was Agassiz, now the most famous scientist in America.

The meeting convened as slavery increasingly divided the nation. In just two weeks, John C. Calhoun's death would renew Southern fidelity to him and his view of slavery as a ""positive good."" That fall, the Compromise of 1850 would avert a showdown between free and slave states after the Mexican-American War, albeit temporarily. Clouds of war clustered on the horizon.

In that environment, Agassiz spent his free time soaking in Charleston’s plantation culture. He befriended prominent locals, including John Edwards Holbrook, an internationally known herpetologist and a founder of the Medical College of South Carolina. Holbrook offered Agassiz access to his Cooper River plantation where he could stroll and observe enslaved people up close.

""He was fascinated by slavery, a labor system completely unknown in his homeland; he was even more fascinated by the slaves,"" writes Rogers, the Agassiz expert.

When the scientific meeting was in session, Agassiz kept busy presenting his own papers and opining on others.

On day four, one by surgeon and anthropologist Josiah Nott particularly caught his attention. Although it focused on Jews, Nott made the larger argument that “no physical causes exist which can transform one race into another, as the white man into the negro, etc.”

The races, he added, “did not originate from a common center.”

Agassiz rose to speak. Here in the Deep South, he didn't need to soften his views.

The different races, he declared, were “well marked and distinct.” He agreed: People did not originate “from a common pair.”

Nott, the scientist whose paper triggered them, wasn’t at the meeting. But when he heard what happened, he dashed off a note to Morton, the scientist with the skulls, a fellow polygenesis believer.

“With Agassiz in the war,"" he wrote, ""the battle is ours.”

The contentious meeting adjourned with Agassiz prepared to return home for his wedding.

But among his new friends was Dr. Robert Gibbes, a physician to elite planters in the state capital of Columbia. The role gave Gibbes access to thousands of enslaved people on plantations — including the dwindling few who had been born in Africa. Congress had ended the international slave trade four decades earlier, so most slaves by then had been born in the United States.

Gibbes made Agassiz an offer: Come examine them yourself.

Agassiz couldn't say no. He abruptly postponed his wedding and boarded a train to Columbia.

A good 130 miles of pine forest and cotton fields later, he arrived. Agassiz had never been to the interior of South Carolina.

During his weeklong visit, he dined with the Hamptons, Taylors and other patricians of Columbia society. They too allowed him access to their plantations, where he thrilled at viewing captives from Africa up close.

How many people were subjected to his notoriously rigorous observations, or just what they entailed, remains unknown, Rogers said. But given he would return to Boston soon, Agassiz surely lamented his fleeting access to this trove of people.

So he and Gibbes concocted a solution. It involved a fairly new technology that could produce permanent — and highly detailed — images.

Before this technology arrived to huge fanfare in 1839, only the most wealthy could afford portrait paintings. Few people had visual records of themselves. That was changing thanks to this new photography, which Edgar Allen Poe declared “perhaps the most extraordinary triumph of modern science.""

After Agassiz returned to Boston to marry and to pursue his work at Harvard, Gibbes moved forward with plans in earnest. He reached out to Joseph Zealy, the top photographer in town.

Zealy worked from a second-floor studio on Main Street downtown that welcomed clients into a handsomely decorated parlor complete with a piano. A dark backdrop, a rug with diamond patterns, a wooden chair, and a stool provided tools for taking elegant portraits. A skylight ensconced his subjects in natural light.

There, he photographed an array of socialites, planters, politicians and merchants.

One day in spring 1850, a small group of enslaved people arrived. They numbered at least seven.

What did each of them — Alfred, Drana, Fassena, Jack, Jem, Delia and Renty — think when they were transported downtown to this strange building?

Most of the people were middle-aged or older. Most also toiled on plantations owned by Benjamin Taylor, the Princeton-educated state representative, racehorse breeder and cotton grower.

A man named Renty, who hailed from the Congo, likely was the oldest. He arrived with his daughter Delia, likely the youngest, around 20 years old.

Another man also came from a Taylor plantation. Born in Guinea, his named was Jack. He was a “driver,” someone who oversaw other enslaved workers and therefore walked a tightrope between master and fellow captives.

Jack arrived with his daughter Drana, the second woman in the group.

Two other men, Alfred and Jem, were owned by different slaveholders in the Columbia area.

Fassena, a 57-year-old West African carpenter, was owned by Col. Wade Hampton II, planter and member of a South Carolina dynasty. Fassena likely helped build Hampton’s famed Millwood mansion, which Gen. William Sherman would burn down 15 years later on his infamous March to the Sea.

Jem, who was a few years older, likely was the only one who worked in the city, Rogers said. His owner lived several blocks away from Gibbes.

Did they all arrive at the same time to wait and witness the others' suffering?

Did they know what was about to happen to them? Or why?

And who ordered them to remove their clothing?

Surely Gibbes was there, directing Zealy as to how one should position specimens for observation: up close, then full body. Frontal view, side, back.

History shrouds details of what happened inside the studio as each person stood before the camera for the 3 to 15 minutes each daguerreotype required.

Daguerreotypes produce a black-and-white image that records the texture of every hair and nail, the divots of each wrinkle and scar.

Charleston historian Harlan Greene describes the images in an essay for a voluminous book about the daguerreotypes. Published in the fall by Harvard's Peabody Museum Press and co-edited by Rogers, it is entitled “To Make Their Own Way in the World: The Enduring Legacy of the Zealy Daguerreotypes.""

Greene writes, “It’s not just the subjects’ nakedness and their lack of power over the camera’s clinical eye that horrify, but it’s the full front and back views, the debasing and degrading reduction of human beings to specimens, that is the real issue.”

When Zealy completed his work, he placed each picture into a leather case lined in red velvet and stamped with his name. Then he gave them to Gibbes.

Excited, he also penned a note to Morton, the scientist with the skulls: “I have just finished daguerreotypes for Agassiz of native Africans of various tribes. I wish you could see them.”

Then he shipped the images to Agassiz at Harvard.

That fall, when Agassiz received the daguerreotypes, he apparently was so excited that he brought them to a gathering of his elite Harvard peers.

The men were part of the Cambridge Scientific Club, which counted among its members two Harvard presidents, historians, philosophers, lawyers and literature professor Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, although the poet wasn't there that evening.

Rain poured as the men gathered in one members' palatial home. The night's discussion topic was the unity of races.

When they got to business, Agassiz pulled out the daguerreotypes.

He passed them around.

Those gathered studied the images: two women with their breasts exposed, men with naked genitals. What did they think?

Viewing nude enslaved people wasn’t unusual among slaveowners, explains John Stauffer, a Harvard professor of English, African and African American Studies.

“It was common for white men, in particular, to look at scantily clad or naked slaves in public, especially at auctions and whippings,” he writes in “To Make Their Own Way in the World.”

Ilisa Barbash, a Peabody curator and co-editor of the book, notes the particular exploitation of Black women who ""were scrutinized on auction blocks, raped in the households where they served, and acted as 'wet nurses' to children not their own.""

What was the reaction in that room? Rogers, who unearthed evidence the meeting occurred, said details remain elusive.

Perhaps a clue lingers in the fact that Agassiz never published the images. Nor does it appear he presented them again.

Instead, the daguerreotypes wound up in a drawer in the attic of Harvard's Peabody Museum until 1976, a century after Agassiz’s death, when the group of employees discovered them.

Back before the internet could so easily set images free to the global masses, Harvard tried to restrict access to and dissemination of the disturbing photographs.

It required viewers to sign a contract promising not to use them without the university’s permission.

One day in the 1990s, Carrie Mae Weems, an acclaimed Black artist, signed the agreement. She’d been lecturing about the daguerreotypes for years as part of her interest in how Black people had been portrayed in photography.

Despite signing the contract, she used the pictures anyway in a project entitled “From Here I Saw What Happened and I Cried, 1995-1996.”

The university threatened to sue her.

In a 2009 interview with the program Art21, she recalled thinking: The richest university in the world is going to sue me for using these images?

After considering Harvard's effort to control the images, she called back: “I think actually you suing me would be a really good thing. You should. And we should have this conversation in court.”

In 2010, a couple hours' drive away from Harvard, an elderly Black woman lay dying.

At 86, Mattye Thompson Lanier knew her time on earth was dwindling. So did her daughter Tamara Lanier, who sat listening to her mother retell the family stories she had long shared with pride.

Mattye had grown up in Montgomery, Ala., the daughter of sharecroppers, picking cotton herself, going to college with civil rights activist Ralph Abernathy and then migrating north to Connecticut.

Her brother, a carpenter, had even taken part in the Montgomery bus boycott. His given name was Renty William, although everyone called him Willie.

Mattye especially loved to talk about an enslaved ancestor who had taught himself to read and then taught others, despite the severe risks. They called him Papa Renty.

As her body weakened, Mattye persisted: “I want you to do this.”

While grieving, Tamara Lanier realized she’d made a promise. But she knew nothing about doing genealogy research — and what she did know was that it was particularly hard for African Americans to find clues to identity in slavery's void. White people had seen little value in recording much about their human property.

Lanier felt overwhelmed. A chief probation officer, she left work one day to get lunch at a favorite little ice cream shop in downtown Norwich, a small harbor city in eastern Connecticut. The older couple who owned it often made small talk as she paid for her salads.

This time, Lanier told them about her mother’s death. And the promise. She mentioned Papa Renty.

“Let me help,” the owner, Richard Morrison, offered. Lanier thanked him and left.

A week or so later, she returned for lunch.

“Where have you been?” Lanier recalled him asking. “I found your Papa Renty on the internet!”

Morrison emailed her details. That evening, Lanier opened his note to find a story about Agassiz. Her eyes connected with a man staring back from an old daguerreotype. The article said his name was Renty.

“I knew in my heart he was the man I’d heard about for so many years.”

Knowing in her heart and finding historical evidence proved quite different.

As Frederick Douglass once lamented, “Genealogical trees do not flourish among slaves.” And in many Southern cities, what little did exist had been destroyed in wars, earthquakes, hurricanes and fires.

Lanier was luckier than most; Gibbes had left a critical clue. On the note he'd stuck to the pictures of Renty, he named the man's owner: B. F. Taylor, or Benjamin Franklin Taylor.

Lanier started calling South Carolina libraries, clerks' offices and universities. She found plenty about the prominent Taylor family — but little about the descendants of the enslaved people on their plantations.

“I was hitting so many roadblocks and dead ends,” she recalled.

Night after night, long into darkness, she combed online records, agonizing at the massive gaps. The longing to know family history “really creates a void that’s hard explain,” she said.

But she did find a few gold nuggets along the barren historical road.

Among them was an 1834 slave index of Benjamin Taylor's father's estate. It listed hundreds of people sectioned off into family groupings. Two families included men named Renty.

On the left-hand side, one Renty was listed with six others, including Delia, the woman in the daguerreotypes.

On the right-hand side, ""Big Renty"" was listed with two other people.

Over time, she also found a living Black descendent of the Taylor plantations who knew how to get in touch with Dr. Edmund Rhett Taylor, a descendant of Benjamin Taylor. The man was almost 100 years old.

Lanier stared at Dr. Taylor's phone number. Would he slam the phone down? Dismiss her? Listen? Laugh? Apologize?

Mostly, Lanier wanted to know where the Taylor family had migrated, taking their enslaved workers with them. Her mother's family had lived in Montgomery, Ala., during Jim Crow.

“You don’t know who I am,” Lanier recalled saying. “My family descended from Benjamin Taylor’s plantation ... ”

Mary Haque, the elderly physician's daughter, responded kindly. She put Taylor on the line.

He, in turn, invited Lanier to their home in Columbia.

So in May 2016, she stood at the front door of the Taylor family’s house on a lake in Columbia. Taylor, his wife, daughter and other relatives greeted her warmly.

Like Lanier’s mother, Taylor proved a gifted storyteller. Still sharp and gregarious, he read aloud from family documents he’d collected, stopping to sprinkle in family lore.

""In that moment, I felt I was hearing from him the historic perspective of the slaveholder that was completely in line with what I had heard from my mother. Both stories were virtually the same but told from two different perspectives.”

As they spoke, Lanier also recognized names.

Mary, John, William, Anne, Sarah, Benjamin, George and Simon — all names in common. She realized her own family members were named after the Taylors.

When the daguerreotypes came up, Taylor noted that Benjamin hadn't been particularly interested in science. Lanier wondered if Gibbes, the Taylor family’s physician, had been honest about where he'd planned to take the enslaved people that day — or why.

Then she got the answer she'd come for. The Taylors confirmed that Benjamin Taylor had, indeed, owned property in Alabama.

Between her mother's stories and the records she found, Lanier began to piece together a story.

Her grandfather Renty Taylor was born enslaved by the Taylors in South Carolina. She believes he was the son of ""Renty"" listed on the 1834 slave index and grandson of ""Big Renty,"" the man in the daguerreotypes.

After Benjamin Taylor died, this third Renty's new owners changed his name to Renty Thompson. After the war, he migrated to Alabama.

There, Renty Thompson had nine children, including a son named Frederick Thompson.

And that man, Lanier said, was her mother's father.

In 2010, Lanier approached the Peabody Museum with a request. She’d found evidence that she could be a descendant of Renty and Delia and wanted to see their likenesses in person.

The museum agreed. Lanier took her daughter, unsure what to expect. She also brought the early research she had gathered so far.

When they arrived, Lanier handed the documents to a woman. Then they went through enough security, signatures and other hoops that the whole process felt hollow and strange by time they set eyes on the daguerreotypes.

After they left, Lanier said, she heard nothing back about the documents she'd shared.

The following year, she emailed Harvard’s then-president, Drew Faust. Could Harvard provide a formal review of her research?

Four years had passed since several dozen Harvard students set out to unearth the storied university’s complicity in slavery. They discovered that its presidents had enslaved people live with them on campus and that the university's “significant endowments had drawn from the exploitation of slave labor.""

Their findings prompted fresh discussions and actions at Harvard aimed at grappling with that history.

Faust emailed back that she appreciated Lanier’s “offer to be of assistance” and that two employees “have agreed to be in touch with you if they discover any new information.”

Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane, however, said researchers already had engaged with Lanier. She’d been welcomed to view the daguerreotypes and met with an archivist.

""Members of the Peabody staff were excited when they first learned Ms. Lanier’s story,"" Dane said.

They also had reviewed what research she'd handed over and encouraged her to share any other evidence she found.

""Ms. Lanier was treated with respect and repeatedly informed that the museum was open to reviewing additional information about her story,"" Dane added.

This kind of historical research is notoriously difficult to prove with certainty, especially for African Americans whose descendants are recorded only as first names, often common ones, if they are recorded at all.

A few years later, in 2017, Lanier heard that Harvard was hosting a conference at which the acclaimed Black writer Ta-Nehisi Coates would give the keynote.

She and her daughter attended. When they walked in, Renty's image stared back from a gigantic screen. It also adorned the conference's program. Renty, she said, was described as invisible.

Lanier felt insulted. By then, she had collected enough research and oral family history that she felt convinced the Renty staring back was Papa Renty.

“It was a slight to my mother and her reverence of him, her memories of him,"" Lanier recalled. ""This larger-than-life person, they referred to as invisible.”

She wrote to Faust again. She didn't want Harvard, the school that had employed Agassiz, to tell Renty and Delia's story anymore.

This time, she included a demand: “Please accept this notice as my formal request to have the Slave Daguerreotypes immediately relinquished to me as the lineal descendant of Congo Renty and our family.”

Harvard did not give her the daguerreotypes. So Lanier contacted Benjamin Crump, the prominent Houston attorney who represents the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor — whose killings prompted nationwide protests over the summer and deeper discussions about racism.

In spring 2019, they sued Harvard in Massachusetts state court.

On Twitter, Crump called it one of the most important cases since Brown v. Board of Education. “By my calculation, Renty is 169 years a slave. When will Harvard finally set him free?""

The complaint reads part historical odyssey of sin, part legal challenge alleging unlawful “seizure, possession and expropriation of photographic images.” It asks a court to force the university to hand over the daguerreotypes, taken under the subjects' extreme duress, and “at long last, bring Renty and Delia home.”

As next of kin, Crump argued, Lanier has more right to the daguerreotypes than Harvard, which employed the racist man who directed the crime of their taking.

“We believe this lawsuit is landmark in nature,"" Crump told The Post and Courier.

If Lanier prevails, he said it would be the first reparations lawsuit in which a Black descendant of slavery recovered something from an institution through a direct legal action.

He compared it to Jews trying to recover family artifacts taken by Nazis during the Holocaust.

“There is no way that Harvard is the rightful owner of what are essentially the family photographs of this Black family,” Crump said. “Why should they continue to benefit from illegal, immoral activities?”

Dane, the Harvard spokeswoman, said the university doesn't comment on pending legal action.

In court filings, its attorneys counter that Lanier has no right to the images “however objectionable the circumstances of the photograph’s origins.” The museum acquired them legally, and its use of the images is protected by the First Amendment, they argue.

Under the law, images belong to the photographer or the person who commissioned the work, not people in them. Harvard will need to provide evidence connecting ownership from Agassiz to the university, said Brent Sausser, a Charleston-based intellectual property attorney.

Did Agassiz donate them to Harvard? After his death in 1873, his son Alexander assumed his post there. Did Alexander acquire them through probate and donate them?

“That is big,” Sausser said. “There needs to be a little more digging.”

If Harvard cannot prove those links, perhaps the photographs belong to Agassiz's family. Recently, 43 of them wrote to Harvard to support Lanier. Giving the pictures to her family, they wrote, “would begin to make amends for the white supremacist theory Agassiz espoused.”

In October, a judge heard arguments over Harvard’s motion to dismiss the case but hasn't ruled yet.

The daguerreotypes are among the Peabody’s most fragile objects. They are highly sensitive to light and stored in a cooled, monitored room, removed only twice a year for students and researchers to view.

They also are extremely valuable, Crump noted, and any museum would covet them. To him, Black descendants of the victims ought to decide which museum gets to hold them in its collection.

Lanier told The Post and Courier that if she prevails, she is committed to keeping the images safely preserved somewhere like the new International African American Museum being built in Charleston.

She also wants to keep them accessible.

“To understand the pain and the impact of these images, you have to see them,” she said. “If Emmett Till had had a closed casket, we would never have known his name.”

After Till's murder in Mississippi in 1955 for allegedly offending a White woman at a grocery story, his family made the decision to display his suffering in that casket.

Display of Renty and Delia's bodies, Lanier argued, likewise should be hers.

Then again, the historical genie already has escaped. Copyrights also have expired, and digital versions of the daguerreotypes circulate widely on the internet, for anyone to see.",Woman fights Harvard over rights to nude SC images of her enslaved ancestors,www.postandcourier.com

The man’s car crashed into a tree and caught fire in Dandenong North just after 3.30am as he tried to get away from police.

Sergeant Julie-Anne Newman said the driver was first spotted by police on Stud Road in Rowville about 3.30am.

She said police tried to intercept the SUV after it was identified the driver was of interest to police for an outstanding matter.

But the man failed to stop and sped off through a red light. Police deployed stop sticks on Stud Road near the intersection of Brady Road as they tried to bring the driver to a halt.

“Police lost sight of the vehicle before officers, who were attempting to locate the vehicle and travelling south on Stud Road, saw a flash in the distance,” Sergeant Newman said.

“The car was found crashed into a tree and on fire.”

Police pulled the driver from the burning car and provided first aid but the 43-year-old Maribyrnong man died at the scene.

Superintendent Helen Sattler said it was quite confronting and distressing for the officers first on the scene who tried to save the man.

“It is never a nice incident to attend to and they showed great courage in pulling the driver out of the car while it was on fire,” she said.

“We will be offering counselling to those members and also to the family of the deceased person if they so desire.”

Superintendent Sattler said it was not a pursuit but police followed the car from a distance “to see where it was going to end up”.

She said it was inappropriate to comment further on what caused the man to crash or if he was previously known to police as a report was being prepared for the coroner.

She said police deployed the stop sticks due to his erratic driving but there was nothing to indicate that it was a stolen car.

The roads surrounding the crash were cordoned off for about nine hours while Major Collision Investigation Unit detectives investigated the incident.

Professional Standards Command will oversee the investigation as is standard procedure when a death occurs following contact with police.

A report will also be prepared for the coroner.

Stud Road, Dandenong North between Heatherton Road and Mcfees Road was reopened about 12.45pm.

The package – described by police as made up of feathers surrounded by a box along with a spray-painted message – prompted police to cordon off Congress Square for more than three hours Saturday afternoon. Multiple businesses were evacuated while police X-rayed the package to determine if it was dangerous.

Lt. Robert Martin said the department’s hazardous device team determined the package was not an explosive device.

“The contents of the package can be described as concerning and a criminal investigation is currently underway to determine who placed the package and their motivation for this act,” Martin said in a statement.

Martin said the world “BALM” was spray-painted on the sidewalk. Police are not releasing any other details about the contents of the package, he said.

The package and message were found by museum employees.

Police say surveillance video captured a light-colored pickup truck turning from High Street onto Free Street and parking just before 11 a.m. The man driving the truck then carried the package to the museum, placed it in the vestibule and drove off down Free Street, according to Martin.

The busy intersection of Congress and High streets was blocked to vehicle traffic and pedestrians for more than three hours. Congress Street reopened by 6:30 p.m.

304,305,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9180131/Husband-woman-shot-dead-five-children-says-going-truly-dark-time.html,"The husband of a Virginia woman who killed five children before taking her own life says he is going through a 'truly dark time'.

Brian Bumgarner was married to Oreanna Myers, 25, when she shot her three sons and two step-children at her home near Williamsburg on December 8.

Myers then set fire to the property before turning the gun on herself. According to police, Myers was upset that her husband had been staying with relatives during the work week for logistical reasons, instead of coming home to her.

The dead children have been identified as Shaun Dawson Bumgarner, 7, Riley James Bumgarner, 6, Kian Myers, 4, Aarikyle Nova Myers, 3 and Haiken Jirachi Myers, age 1.

One day after the tragedy, Bumgarner took to Facebook, sharing a status with his friends which read: 'I just wanted to say sorry and thank you to everyone reaching out to me and messaging me. I can't get back to all of you but in a truly dark time, I feel like I could fall and all of you guys would catch me. It gives me something... I don't know what. Maybe it be hope or strength or grit, I don't know. All I know is I have something and that's not nothing!!!'

Bumgarner has since locked his Facebook account and has not spoken publicly about the death of his wife and five children.

Meanwhile, Myers' sister, McKenzie Kersey, also took to Facebook in the days following the tragedy, paying tribute to her late sister.

'I don't know what I'll miss more: the love you radiated or the hugs you gave me,' Kersey wrote beneath a photo that showed her in an embrace with Myers.

Details about the horrific December 8 event were revealed during a news conference on Thursday.

Speaking to media, Greenbrier County Sheriff Bruce Sloan said the five children's bodies were found with shotgun wounds to the heads inside the Williamsburg home, while Myers was found outside near a picnic table.

Sheriff Sloan described how Myers was found, revealing that she was wearing a coat with a hood, and had a red line drawn across her face from ear to ear, reported MetroNews.com.

The mysterious line was seen on surveillance video when Myers had gone to pick up two of her sons from the bus stop at the end of the school day. One of the boys asked her if it was blood on her face, but Myers replied she had just drawn the line.

An hour later, emergency dispatch got a 911 call about a house fire on Flynns Creek Road. When firefighters arrived on the scene just before 4pm, they found the residence engulfed in flames.

About 40 minutes later, Myers' body was found outdoors. Four of the children were found dead inside the house that same day, but the fifth child's body was only recovered from the debris four days later, reported WVNS-TV.

Bumgarner stayed with relatives instead of at home during the work week due to transportation issues. Text messages between Myers and her husband showed that his absence during the week had been 'a tremendous source of contention' between them.

According to the Sheriff Sloan, Myers grew more desperate after Bumgarner left the house on December 6 after dropping off groceries for his family.

'You'll have nothing to come back to but to corpse [sic]. No one cares why should I?' Myers texted her husband.

'Money will come and go, once I go there's no replacing me. I beg and cry for help but never get it. It's my mental health that needs tending to–help me– I do not care anymore.'

Sloan said he was unaware of whether the woman was under treatment for any diagnosed mental illness at the time of the deaths. But in several notes she left before carrying out the murder-suicide and setting fire to her family home, Myers complained about the lack of treatment for mental illness, according to the sheriff.

'This is no one's fault but my own. My demons won over me. Sorry, I wasn't strong enough,' she wrote.

Myers texted her husband the day of the shootings saying she left something for him in their vehicle. A letter addressed to him was found inside with a bloody fingerprint next to her initials, Sloan said.

'I'm so sorry Brian,' she wrote to her husband. 'I was not strong enough for you or this family. My head is so (expletive). I'm sorry for my evil crime. I was not strong enough to fight these demons, Snap. Crunch, Boom. So depressed. Heart numb. Soul completely shattered. I am sorry I failed you. I am sorry I failed our handsome boys. I am so sorry I was not strong enough. OAM.'

The sheriff said the woman also placed three notes inside a plastic bag and taped them to a side-view mirror on the family vehicle, including phone numbers to reach relatives, a confession and a will.

'I had shot all of the boys in the head. I had set house on fire. I had shot myself in the head. I'm sorry,' she wrote in her confession. 'Mental health is serious. I hope one day someone will help others like me. Mental health is not to joke about or taken lightly. When someone begs, pleads, cries out for help, please help them. You just might save a life or more lives. Thank you, OAM.'

Also recovered from the vehicle were glass jar with a crystal and a cloth decorated with a spiral symbol.

According to a joint obituary for four of the children, Haiken, Kian and Aarikyle were Myers' biological sons, while Shaun and Riley were her husband's children from his marriage to Raven Frisbie.

Following Thursday's press conference detailing the investigation into the murder-suicide, Frisbie wrote on her Facebook page: 'She murdered my babies and now everyone knows it. I've been more than patient waiting for this day and now that it's here there is nothing that is going to keep me quiet. I fought for them while they were alive and I will continue to do so after.'

According to the obituary for the children, Shaun was a second-grade student at Frankford Elementary and wanted to be an astronaut. Riley was in kindergarten and loved sports. He was also interested in music and was learning to play the piano and the ukulele.

'Aarikyle loved painting, being a kid and was sneaky,' the obituary read. 'He loved Ninja Turtles and superheroes. Haiken being the youngest was spoiled by all and loved driving his toy cars.'",Husband of woman who shot dead five children speaks out about tragedy,www.dailymail.co.uk
305,306,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/update-us-slams-russia-for-using-force-agai-1149680.html,"WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 24th January, 2021) The United States has condemned what it calls forceful suppression of protests held across Russia in support of detained opposition activist Alexey Navalny and urged Russian authorities to release all detained protesters, the US State Department said.

Unauthorized rallies took place in dozens of Russian cities on Saturday. The Russian Foreign Ministry warned against foreign meddling, condemning the US embassy for publishing maps of the protests and saying that US diplomats would be summoned over the incident. The US embassy published locations of the protests and advised US citizens to avoid these locations.

""The United States strongly condemns the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists this weekend in cities throughout Russia ... Continued efforts to suppress Russians' rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, the arrest of opposition figure Aleksey Navalny, and the crackdown on protests that followed are troubling indications of further restrictions on civil society and fundamental freedoms,"" the US State Department said on Saturday.

The statement said that by suppressing Russians' rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, the Russian authorities are violating OSCE commitments, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and international obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

""We call on Russian authorities to release all those detained for exercising their universal rights and for the immediate and unconditional release of Aleksey Navalny. We urge Russia to fully cooperate with the international community's investigation into the poisoning of Aleksey Navalny and credibly explain the use of a chemical weapon on its soil,"" the US State Department said.

UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has also called for the release of protesters detained during the Saturday unauthorized rallies held across Russia.

""The UK condemns the Russian authorities' use of violence against peaceful protesters and journalists. We call on @GovernmentRF to respect its international commitments on human rights in @coe [Council of Europe] and @OSCE [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe], and release citizens detained during peaceful demonstrations,"" Raab said on Twitter.

On Saturday, many Russian cities were hit by protests in support of opposition figure Alexey Navalny, who was detained in Moscow this past Sunday upon his arrival at Sheremetyevo International Airport. Prior to Navalny's return to Russia from Germany, where he was treated for his alleged poisoning, the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service warned it would arrest him for probation violations as he was previously found guilty of committing two administrative offenses.

On Monday, a court in Russia ruled to keep Navalny in detention for 30 days. On January 29, a Moscow court is expected to decide whether Navalny's suspended sentence should be replaced with prison time for breach of suspension conditions.

The US State Department, European Council President Charles Michel, as well as an array of western foreign ministries and ministers have called on the Russian authorities to release Navalny.

Commenting on the West's reaction, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called it an attempt to shift attention from the crisis of the liberal model of development. According to the diplomat, his Western counterparts are visibly ""happy"" to churn out nearly identical statements.

In relation to various comments on Navalny's detention, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has advised foreign officials to respect international law and focus on domestic issues.

306,307,https://ysnews.com/news/2021/01/ann-handforth-mclellan,"Ann Handforth McLellan, the beloved matriarch of the McLellan family of Yellow Springs, died at home on Jan. 6, 2021. She was 95.

A woman of great optimism and wit, Ann instilled in her four children a deep love of learning, determination to contribute to society and a knack for witty quips.

Ann was born in Nutley, N.J., on March 14, 1925, the fourth of six children of Jessie and Hunter Handforth. She grew up in a house designed by her father, out in the country near Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.

She excelled in school and was awarded several college scholarships. But she left St. Lawrence College during her sophomore year to join her high school sweetheart, David Stanley McLellan, in Clovis, N.M. They were married there shortly before the U.S. Army Air Force sent David to the Pacific theater as a B29 navigator during World War II.

After the war, Ann and David bicycled all over Europe, then lived in Grenoble, France, for several years. Later, when the family, now with four children, lived in California, Ann encouraged her college professor husband to apply for an academic post abroad in the 1960s. The family returned to France to live in Bordeaux for two years. At Ann’s urging, the family traveled all over Europe, including to the Soviet Union. Returning from that trip, the family found itself in Prague during the Prague Spring revolt.

Ann managed their lively household in Riverside, Calif., as well as organizing the family for long-term research and teaching stays in Berkeley, Washington, D.C., France, England and Italy. She also found time to read and type David’s book manuscripts. She completed her undergraduate degree at the University of California Riverside and later studied Italian.

Ann came from a family of artists, loved the arts, and found satisfaction working in marquetry and watercolors.

She was politically active. She and David supported the civil rights movement and opened their home for fundraising events. While in California, the family boycotted grapes and lettuce for a time in support of farmworkers. She served as Democratic Party Precinct Captain in Riverside and as a loyal poll worker. Later, after the family moved to Oxford, Ohio, in 1970, she was an organizer and prolific letter writer on behalf of Amnesty International.

Ann and David took great pleasure in their grandchildren. Ann overcame her fear of flying to spend time with new grandbabies in Minnesota, provided a midweek refuge to one child who attended private school, and drove long distances to attend sporting events and chauffeur grandchildren. Family came together each year at the summer home they built for themselves on Prince Edward Island in Canada.

In 2002, Ann and David moved to Yellow Springs, where she made many friends, helped at her daughter-in-law’s bookshop, The Epic, and cared for her youngest grandchild, Hypatia McLellan Lichtenfels. Hypatia says, “I like to think that I inherited my spunky and sassy personality from my grandmother, as we were alike in so many ways.”

Ann devoted many years to caring for her husband, who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease and died in 2010. She lived with her daughter, Marjorie McLellan, and son-in-law, Gary Greenberg, in Yellow Springs for the past seven years.

In addition to Marjorie, Gary and Hypatia, Ann is survived by her son, Eric, and daughter, Michele, also of Yellow Springs; sisters, Jane Kester, of Springville, N.Y., and Alice Grow, of Arvada, Colo.; as well as two other grandchildren, Cara Greenberg, of Columbus, and Jesse Greenberg, of San Francisco; and five great-grandchildren. Her oldest daughter, Hilary, passed in 2009.

So when he had a clear out and sold off many of the items he has fixed over the years, a few eyebrows were raised.

But there was a method behind his madness.

Tuc, who works at the High School for Gifted Students under Vietnam National University, Hanoi, loves the subject he teaches so much, he has decided to take his work home with him, by building a laboratory in his house.

Born to a poor family, Tuc was determined to study since childhood in a bid to change his life for the better. After graduating from university, majoring in radio, he didn’t find work immediately.

“Because of what I learned at university and what I taught myself, I’m quite good at fixing things,” he said. “People usually asked me to fix their broken items and I was happy to help.""

Tuc knows that books and lectures are important, but when it comes to teaching, nothing beats the hands-on approach.

He added: “Since I start teaching physics, doing experiments is always an indispensable part in my classroom.”

Some experiments took time and effort, both at school and at home, but they were really helpful for his students to learn.

However, Tuc found that few teachers conducted experiments in class and students did not have chance to go to labs.

“I had thought about a lab where teachers and students could access proper equipment, tools and instructions to improve experimental skills,” Tuc said.

So at his home on Vu Huu Street in Hanoi he created a lab that is open for students from sixth grade to university and physics teachers in Hanoi and other provinces.

It is called the Edison Physics Experimental Centre and since it opened four years ago, has helped students of all ages.

Hundreds of experiments sets are available at the centre. Most were made by Tuc and his colleagues, others were bought when he took his students abroad for international competitions.

Besides basic experimental sets for lessons at schools, there are other advanced sets which aims to create challenges and inspire students’ creation in selecting materials, structures and options to design models.

An electrical model made by Tuc can be used to do 500 different experiments from secondary schools to university levels.

He said that he preferred instructing students to approach new theory thanks to equipment and experiments in which they could understand matters easier.

“It helps save time rather than describing with words,” Tuc said, adding that experiments also help learners understand clearly about the nature of the phenomenon and how the rules of physics affect things in daily life.

In a lesson on measuring length, Tuc asked students to take measurements and show them the consequences of what would happen if they made mistakes.

In another lesson on measuring weight, Tuc asked students to identify Vietnam’s land area after weighing the nation’s map using just a scale and scissors.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many Vietnamese and foreign students have gone to Tuc’s lab and conducted experiments and then sent results to their professors in other countries.

“A top priority of the centre is to make practicing go hand in hand with theory,” Tuc said.

“I’m looking forward to helping Vietnamese students be good at physics and then confidently apply what they learn in daily life and work.”

Do Doan Duc, a teacher working at Tuc’s centre said students there could learn much thanks to experimental sets, many of which were designed like games to make learning fun.

“At the centre, students can also make and monitor robots which support them in doing experiments or other activities,” Duc said.

“Having a great time with science and technology during school is expected to nurture their passion and dreams for the future,” he said. VNS",Home-based lab inspires students,vietnamnet.vn

The S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control has identified 6,040 students and 2,425 school employees who've tested positive for COVID-19 while regularly attending in-person classes or activities. The latest data, released Friday, accounts for the state's approximately 850,000 students in public and private K-12 schools, though DHEC doesn't report infection data for students learning virtual-only from home.

Several schools cut down on in-person events for a few weeks after the winter break, but are now returning to sports, clubs and meetings. While case numbers are still higher than immediately before the holidays, the average day has brought fewer new cases than in early January.

New cases reported: 3,435, which is 2,074 percent higher than the 158 tallied on March 31, the day Gov. Henry McMaster ordered nonessential businesses to close.

Percent of positive tests, seven-day average: 24.6 percent. Five percent of tests or fewer returning positive results is a good sign the virus' spread is slowing, researchers say.

According to DHEC data, the top counties for new coronavirus cases reported Saturday were Greenville, 450; Richland, 403; and Spartanburg, 245.

On Saturday, Charleston County reported 177 new cases while Berkeley had 79 and Dorchester logged 96.

Fifteen of the 63 deaths that DHEC confirmed Saturday were victims aged 35 to 64 and the rest were 65 or older.

They lived in Aiken, Bamberg, Beaufort, Berkeley, Charleston, Cherokee, Chesterfield, Dorchester, Florence, Georgetown, Greenville, Greenwood, Laurens, Lexington, Newberry, Oconee, Orangeburg, Pickens, Richland, Spartanburg, Union, Williamsburg and York counties.

Of the 2,224 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 on Saturday, 445 were in intensive care and 283 were on ventilators.

What do experts say?

Authorities continue to urge South Carolinians to take precautions, such as wearing masks or other face coverings, social distancing and frequently washing hands.

They also urge anyone who believes they’ve been exposed to the virus or who is developing symptoms to get tested. Those out in the community or not able to socially distance should get tested monthly, DHEC advised.","Over 6,000 SC students have attended school during coronavirus infectious period",www.postandcourier.com

310,311,https://www.euronews.com/2021/01/23/meetooinceste-emmanuel-macron-promises-to-crack-down-on-child-sex-abuse-following-online-c,"Emmanuel Macron has assured victims of interfamily sex abuse that they will ""never be alone again"" after an online campaign that saw hundreds of people share traumatic experiences prompted him to tighten laws on incest.

The French president said the statute of limitations for incest had already been increased to 30 years, and that checks on those working with children had improved - but stressed this was still not enough.

He has now pledged additional sexual abuse screening prevention meetings for all children in elementary and middle schools, along with state-funded psychological treatment for victims.

Speaking in a video statement on Saturday, he said: ""Shattered lives in the sanctuary of a child’s room. Stolen childhoods during family vacations, or times that should have been innocent.

""These testimonies, these words, these cries, no one can ignore them anymore. Against sexual violence against our children, it is now up to us to act.""

This pledge comes in response to a recent online movement that has dominated social media in France after the publication of a book that accused a top French political commentator of abusing his stepson.

Launched by activists of the French feminist group, #NousToutes, in reference to #MeToo, hundreds of victims shared harrowing memories of sexual abuse by family members under the hashtag #MeTooInceste.

The book, meanwhile, was written by Camille Kouchner, the daughter of former foreign minister and founder of Médecins Sans Frontières Bernard Kouchner. She claims her stepfather, political scientist Olivier Duhamel, abused her twin brother three decades ago.

Duhamel has said he is an ""object of personal attacks"" and has resigned from his role overseeing the prestigious Sciences Po university. Neither he nor his lawyer have commented on the allegations.

According to the World Health Organisation, international studies show one in five women and one in 13 men report having been sexually abused before they are 18. However, these figures are believed to be an underestimate due to secrecy that often overshadows the issue.

In his video message, Macron made sure to address all victims of child abuse directly, as he said: ""Today, shame changes sides.

""To those who have already freed yourselves from a burden that you have carried for too long; to those who were about to do it but sometimes hesitated...

The £35million summer signing from Ajax has started just two Premier League games and has played just 15 per cent of United's league minutes at the halfway stage of the competition.

Van de Beek's last start was in the FA Cup third-round win over Watford and he's been an unused substitute in the three Premier League fixtures since then.

But while Solskjaer accepts Van de Beek wants to play more, he has praised his attitude around the club and said he reminds him of his own playing days under Sir Alex Ferguson, when Solskjaer found regular starts hard to come by in a winning team.

“I wouldn't say that Donny is happy, of course he wants to play more, he is driven and he pushes but he gets about his job in the right manner,"" said Solskjaer.

""He reminds me a lot about myself when I first came in that he understands the difficulties and challenges. When we are doing well and have got players who are playing really well in his position, it's not like we just want to give him games for the sake of it, we know that he plays well when he plays.

""I was the same with Sir Alex. When he left me out I understood and I was happy for the team to win and he's that type of guy that he knows he is important for us and knows he is going to play many games.

""He will definitely be involved in this game against Liverpool and he might be the deciding factor in this game. He trusts his own quality.

""He is a quietly confident guy who deep down he knows he is good enough and is just waiting for his opportunity.""

Manchester United were denied a penalty in controversial fashion against Chelsea in the Premier League on Sunday. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his players were furious that Callum Hudson-Odoi wasn't penalised for a handball, as they had to settle for a 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge. The point leaves United 12 points behind leaders Man City, with Crystal Palace the next opponents. MEN Sport will bring you all the build-up to and reaction from every United match.

Van de Beek and fellow summer arrival Alex Telles have struggled for action this season, with the form of Luke Shaw keeping the £15.4million Brazilian out of the team as well.

But Solskjaer has praised the role both are playing in the squad and insists they have played a part in United's 12 game unbeaten run in the Premier League, even if they haven't featured much.

“It's not easy for Donny or Alex who have been captains at their clubs and they see a team that is performing as well as it is and that means they are not playing as much,"" added Solskjaer.

King had been hospitalized with COVID-19. He died Saturday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to Ora Media, a production company King founded with Mexican media mogul Carlos Slim.

""For 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry’s many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster,"" the company said.

King's three surviving children mourned him in a family statement shared Saturday night on his Twitter account.

""We are heartbroken over our father's death,"" the statement read, signed by Larry King Jr., Chance King and Cannon King. ""The world knew Larry King as a great broadcaster and interviewer, but to us he was 'dad.'

""He was the man who lovingly obsessed over our daily schedules and our well-being, and who took such immense pride in our accomplishments – large, small, or imagined. And through it all, we knew without a doubt in the world that he loved us more than life itself. He was an amazing father, and he was fiercely loyal to those lucky enough to call him a friend. We will miss him every single day of our lives.""

Over the course of more than five decades in radio and TV broadcasting, half of it spent hosting CNN’s ""Larry King Live,"" King mingled with the famous and infamous and average people who became either.

By his count, he interviewed more than 60,000 subjects, and when his run on cable ended in 2010, he segued to the internet with ""Larry King Now,"" a daily talk show on Hulu from Ora TV, and became an active presence on Twitter.

He vowed never to retire and to keep interviewing until he died. King was not immune to other illness: 30 years after undergoing quintuple heart bypass surgery, which prompted him to quit a three-pack-a-day cigarette habit and lose weight, a checkup in 2017 revealed a cancerous lung tumor that was removed with surgery.

Report:Larry King has been hospitalized with COVID-19 for more than a week

He revealed he had a stroke in March 2019, was in a coma for weeks and considered suicide. ""I thought I was going to bite the bullet; I didn't want to live this way,"" he told an interviewer at Los Angeles station KTLA. In April that year, he had an angioplasty after complaining of chest pains. Once again, he recovered and kept working.

Near the end of 2020, King landed in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with COVID-19. Hospital protocols prevented his family from visiting him. He was moved to the intensive care unit on New Year's Eve and was receiving oxygen but moved out of the ICU in early January and was breathing on his own, said David Theall, a spokesman for Ora Media.

The author of several books, King started his career in Miami radio before moving on to TV and newspapers. His nightly CNN program, which premiered in 1985, remained the network’s top-rated show throughout his tenure, which ended in 2010.

Though some traditional journalists tended to dismiss him as a celebrity interviewer who didn’t ask tough questions, the truth was a good deal more complex.

""King was one of the few people in broadcast history who basically created his own phenomenon,"" said Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute. ""He didn’t need a network. The network needed him.""

He said, ""He coaxed, rather than challenged, and the result, while not always groundbreaking, was always interesting and smart. His dirty little secret was he was a much more intelligent guy than he let on, and a much better listener than most people in television. But he really believed that his guest was the star, and his job was to help reveal that.""

King’s interview subjects were a virtual Who’s Who. They ranged from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and thousands of others, including Paul McCartney, Bette Davis, Martin Luther King Jr., Eleanor Roosevelt, Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando, Madonna and Malcolm X.

Larry King speaks out:His children Andy and Chaia die within weeks of each other

""I’ve interviewed everybody once,"" he wrote in a 2011 book, ""Truth Be Told."" ""How did I miss Bruce Springsteen?""

The end of his show came unexpectedly. ""Over and over, the execs had told me, ‘You’re here as long as you like,’” he wrote, recounting a meeting in which he’d been given a few months’ notice and promised a series of four yearly specials (later scrapped).

He blamed CNN for installing a former guest, Joy Behar, as host of a competing show on its Headline News Network: ""My own network was cutting into my ratings and then wondering why they were falling,"" he wrote. He rued the changing face of TV news: ""People are tuning into cable news now not so much to get educated as to be entertained and have their own political opinions reinforced.""

He recalled one of his final guests, Conan O’Brien, who had just endured a messy exit from NBC: ""It was good to talk with someone who could tell me what it was like to be on top of the world one minute and off the air the next,"" though ""Conan felt screwed about being replaced. I didn’t."" He was puzzled by the choice of his replacement, Piers Morgan, whom he knew only as a judge of ""America’s Got Talent.""

King had ups and downs in his personal life. The son of an Austrian immigrant who had settled in Brooklyn, New York, he was born Lawrence Harvey Zieger. King talked about surviving as an “acne-faced,” overweight child entertaining classmates by imitating famous radio personalities. His father died of heart disease at 44, impoverishing the family.

King’s break came on a radio station in Miami, doing a night-time interview show. A Miami Herald column followed, in which King talked up stars performing at Miami Beach hotels, such as Frank Sinatra. His weekly musings column ran in USA TODAY from 1982 until 2001.

King described his early years as often chaotic, ruined by his wild spending on cars, gambling and women. He was married eight times to seven wives, earning him a reputation as a womanizer. (He filed for divorce from his most recent – and seventh – wife, Shawn Southwick, in 2010; they reconciled, but he filed for divorce again in 2019.) Constantly in debt and borrowing from friends, he ended up being charged with grand larceny after he failed to repay a $5,000 loan from a friend.

He had five children: Andy and Chaia, the two conceived with his third wife, Playboy bunny Alene Akins, died within weeks of each other in 2020, at 65 and 51, respectively.

Along with his trademark suspenders, King was known for his live interviews and viewer call-in segments. He never seemed to run out of questions.

""I don’t even understand it myself,"" he told Toronto’s Globe & Mail in 2003. ""It’s incessant with me. Who, what, where, when, why, never leaves me. I’m just insatiably curious, which helps in my job. I’m the kind of person you don’t want to sit next to on an airplane. I’ll drive you nuts!""

""He will be missed by so many CNN employees past and present,"" CNN anchor Jim Acosta wrote on Twitter.

""To be a good interviewer is one part asking good questions and a large part just listening,"" radio host Michael Smerconish said Saturday on CNN. ""He knew how to handle that.""","'We are heartbroken': Larry King, CNN talk show legend, dies at 87 after being hospitalized with COVID-19",www.heraldnews.com
316,317,https://www.castanet.net/edition/news-story-322831-4-.htm,"Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says he was once willing to give his former leadership rival Derek Sloan the benefit of the doubt, but no longer.

And he dismissed the idea that kicking Sloan out of caucus this week has pitted him against one of the party's most powerful wings, social conservatives, whose support O'Toole courted directly during the leadership race last year in part by backing Sloan at the time.

In an interview with The Canadian Press, O'Toole said he didn't believe Sloan meant to be racist last year in his characterization of chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam.

That's why he opposed efforts then to kick him out of caucus, O'Toole said.

""I always will give a colleague, or anyone in Parliament, in public life, the benefit of the doubt or, you know, listen to them the first time,"" O'Toole said.

""And that was the case early on with Derek, when he said he did not mean to malign the intentions of Dr. Tam.""

But O'Toole said a ""pattern developed"" since then, and frustrations mounted that Sloan's extreme views posed an ever-present danger to the party's goal of forming government.

It all appeared to come to a head last week.

In the aftermath of riots in the U.S. led by extreme right wing supporters of now-former U.S. president Donald Trump.

O'Toole faced pressure from caucus, conservative supporters and his rivals to firmly disavow any elements of extremism in his party's ranks.

Last Sunday, O'Toole issued a statement doing just that. The next day, media organization PressProgress reported O'Toole's outrage over Sloan's leadership campaign accepting a donation from a known white nationalist.

While O'Toole moved swiftly to start the process of kicking Sloan out — getting 20 per cent of MPs on side as required by law — he insisted the demand was driven by caucus, as evidenced in the majority vote to remove him.

""The caucus was ready to make that decision and send a strong message that we are a welcoming party, we respect one another, and we respect Canadians,"" he said.

O'Toole disputed accusations from Sloan and anti-abortion groups that the decision to kick him out had nothing to do with the Ontario MP's previous statements.

In recent weeks, Sloan has been pushing to get as many socially conservative delegates as possible registered for the party's policy convention in March.

Sloan, as well as the Campaign Life Coalition and RightNow, want enough delegates in their camp so motions they support will pass, including one that would remove the existing policy stating a Conservative government would never regulate abortion.

They also want to elect a slate of directors to the party's national council to entrench their strength.

Sloan said the decision to kick him out was a kneejerk reaction to what happened in the U.S.

But he also contends the move was driven by anger from his fellow MP's unhappy to se him actively courting money and support in their ridings. He's pledged to name them so social conservatives know who is trying to silence their voices, he said.

""They think they are little petty princes ruling these fiefdoms and no one else can have a say,"" Sloan said.

O'Toole rejected the idea that Sloan's efforts amount to an attempt to take over the party, and O'Toole's own move was a bid to stop it.

""There is no such effort to the extent that Mr. Sloan is suggesting,"" he said.

Sloan had little national profile when he entered the Conservative leadership race just a few months after becoming an MP.

But early on, he garnered attention for suggesting he wasn't certain of the scientific basis for a person being LGBTQ.

From there, he quickly became well known for his often extreme social conservative views. His comments about Tam, in which he suggested her loyalty lay with China rather than Canada, sparked outrage and took criticism against him to the next level.","Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole defends decision to back, then oust, Sloan - Canada News",www.castanet.net
317,318,https://www.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSKBN29R22D,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Talks over the divided island of Cyprus will be held in New York in the next two months with the participation of the United Nations, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Friday.

The United Nations has been trying unsuccessfully for decades to reunite Cyprus, split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup. The last attempt collapsed in disarray in 2017 after negotiations attended by all parties.

Only Ankara recognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as an independent state. It does not recognise the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government to the south.

Cavusoglu said Turkey, Greece, Britain - the island’s guarantor powers - and the United Nations would convene the talks with the two Cypriot sides in late February or early March, with the European Union as an observer.

Speaking in Brussels after talks with senior EU officials, Cavusoglu said the bloc had so far “disregarded the rights of the Turkish side”.

“We conveyed to them that this trust needs to be re-established,” he added.

Cyprus’s division has long been a source of friction between Turkey and EU member Greece, which will hold talks next Monday on a separate dispute over maritime rights in the eastern Mediterranean.

318,319,https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/01/23/honduras-attack-reproductive-rights-marriage-equality,"(Washington, DC) – Honduran lawmakers should reject a proposed constitutional amendment that would entrench current harsh restrictions on reproductive rights and the prohibition on same-sex marriage, Human Rights Watch said today.

 

 On January 21, Congress approved in its first reading an amendment that would increase the number of votes needed in Congress to amend two articles of the constitution which prohibit abortion and same-sex marriage. It would increase the votes needed from the current two-thirds majority of the legislature to three-quarters, making future reform of these provisions extremely difficult. The proposed amendment still needs a second vote to be ratified. The next legislative session will begin on January 25.

 

 “Honduras’ draconian legislation already bans abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, when the person’s life and the health are in danger, and when the fetus will not survive outside the womb,” said Ximena Casas, Americas women’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “This decree will make it virtually impossible to carry out the recommendations from multiple international human rights bodies to end this violation of reproductive rights.”

 

 Abortion in Honduras is already illegal in all circumstances. The country’s criminal code imposes prison sentences of up to six years on people who undergo abortions and medical professionals who provide them. The government also bans emergency contraception, or “the morning after pill,” which can prevent pregnancy after rape, unprotected sex, or contraceptive failure.

 

 Honduras also bans same-sex marriage. The 2005 constitutional amendment prohibits recognizing marriage between people of the same sex, including same-sex marriages contracted in other countries. Honduras also bans adoption by same-sex couples.

 

 “By seeking to permanently and comprehensively block any possibility of accessing marriage for same-sex couples, the Honduran Congress is entrenching state-sponsored homophobia,” said Cristian González Cabrera, Americas lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “In a country where LGBT people already experience high levels of violence and discrimination, this effort to amend the constitution is sending the message that these people may be further stigmatized.”

 

 Currently, all constitutional changes need to be ratified by a two-thirds majority in Congress in order to take effect. On January 21, Congress preliminarily approved the amendment after one debate session, even though its rules of procedure require three debates unless there is an “urgency” for any draft bill.

 

 The Special Commission charged with reviewing the proposed constitutional amendment held one consultation with feminist groups on January 19. One activist told Human Rights Watch that they were notified about the consultation less than 24 hours in advance. A group working on the rights of LGBT people told Human Rights Watch that LGBT groups were not consulted.

 

 The reform violates international human rights law, which establishes that denying women and girls access to abortion is a form of discrimination and jeopardizes a range of human rights. The bill misleadingly refers to Article 4(1) of the American Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to life. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has made clear that Article 4(1) does not recognize an absolute right to life before birth. The court has also found that the embryo cannot be understood to be a human being for the purposes of Article 4(1).

 

 Human Rights Watch has researched and seen firsthand the devastating consequences of banning abortion in Honduras. Among others, Human Rights Watch interviewed a woman forced to bear her rapist’s child; a woman facing jail after having a miscarriage; a pro-choice pastor who has faced death threats for her activism; and a doctor who cannot always act in her patients’ best interests.

Criminalizing abortions does not prevent people from ending unwanted pregnancies. It just forces them to put their health and lives at risk to end pregnancies in unsafe settings, desperate, in fear of prosecution, and without access to medical care.

 

 According to the Guttmacher Institute, in countries where abortion is prohibited or only permitted to save the life of the person who is pregnant, the abortion rate is higher than in those where abortion is allowed. The Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice estimated during its visit to Honduras in 2018 that between 51,000 and 82,000 unsafe abortions occur each year in the country.

 

 The Special Commission charged with reviewing the proposed constitutional amendment noted that “creating a constitutional shield that makes it impossible to legalize the practice of abortion” is, in part, a response to advances in “Puerto Rico, Cuba, Uruguay and lately Argentina.” This, in addition to organizing by religious groups, suggests a concerted effort within Honduras to make it harder for the country to join others that are making progress toward compliance with international human rights law on this issue.

 

 With respect to same-sex marriage, the proposed law violates regional human rights standards that prohibit arbitrarily treating same-sex couples differently from different-sex couples, including with respect to marital rights. In a landmark 2017 opinion, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights stated that all rights applicable to family relationships of heterosexual couples should extend to same-sex couples. This opinion is applicable in all 23 states party, including Honduras.

 

 The legislation would also put Honduras out of step with its neighboring countries. Several of Honduras’ neighbors have heeded the Inter-American opinion. In 2018 and 2019, respectively, the Costa Rican and Ecuadorian constitutional courts ruled in favor of marriage equality, citing the Inter-American opinion. These advances follow a wave of earlier progress in Latin America, with Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay recognizing same-sex marriages before the Inter-American opinion. In Mexico, 20 states have marriage equality, while same-sex couples in other states can marry but need authorization from a court.

 

 Honduras’ own penal code prohibits denying access to public services on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. It also prohibits inciting discrimination.

 

 “This proposed constitutional amendment represents an effort to block the long-overdue progress that we’re seeing across much of the Americas region on sexual and reproductive rights and same-sex marriage,” Casas said. “The Honduran Congress should recognize that access to abortion and same-sex marriage is protected by international human rights law and reject this abusive amendment.”","Honduras: Attack on Reproductive Rights, Marriage Equality",www.hrw.org
319,320,https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/is-kanye-west-still-feuding-with-kris-jenner.html,"Kanye West has been a fixture in pop culture for several years, as is his soon-to-be-ex-wife Kim Kardashian West. Momager Kris Jenner has been a key player in many of the issues that the family faced, and has often incurred the wrath of her Grammy-winning son-in-law.

Kanye West and Kris Jenner’s tension goes way back

West’s Twitter account has often been a place where the “Power” rapper has been able to freely speak his mind, often embarrassing and upsetting his family members in the process.

West was active on Twitter through 2020, and often revealed information about his personal and professional life that might’ve been better left in the drafts. West, for example, was candid about the topic of divorce in their family and later apologized for making his wife look bad.

Some of West’s since-deleted tweets were also directed at his mother-in-law. He shared that he was very upset when Kardashian West attempted to fly out to Wyoming with a doctor to try to help him.

“Kim was trying to fly to Wyoming with a doctor to lock me up like on the movie Get Out because I cried about saving my daughters life yesterday,” he said, referring to one of his 2020 presidential campaign events where he revealed that Kardashian West wanted to have an abortion when she was pregnant with their first daughter, North West.

Tweets directed at Jenner soon followed. “Kriss [sic] don’t play with me,” he said, “You and that calmye are not allowed around my children.” He added that both Jenner and Kardashian West “tried to lock [him] up” and posted a screenshot of a text message that he sent to Jenner telling her that she was avoiding his phone calls.

Kanye West is on thin ice with the Kardashian-Jenner family

Despite all the intra-familial drama that the Kardashian-Jenner clan have had, they’ve always been known to stand up for each other. As rumors swirl that the two are reportedly considering a divorce, it’s likely that the whole family hasn’t been communicating with West.

Neither West nor Kardashian West have issued an official statement on their marriage. Page Six first reported that Kardashian West was in contact with a divorce lawyer, though she was reportedly also trying counseling to save their marriage. However, it seems there may be irreconcilable differences, as they’re rumored to have stopped counseling.

RELATED: Did Kris Jenner Start The Rumors About Kanye West and Jeffree Star?

With West and Kardashian West reportedly heading for Splitsville, it’s safe to say that things between West and the rest of the family aren’t completely cordial. However, it appears that Jenner’s businesswoman and publicist mind is still at play in handling how the drama will play out publicly.

Jenner’s communications firm recently issued a cease-and-desist letter to viral TikToker Ava Louise, who first started rumors about West having an affair with beauty guru Jeffree Star.

Any tension between West and Jenner today is being kept under wraps, as West’s Twitter account remains inactive and talks of the impending divorce are all being reported through the grapevine.",Is Kanye West Still Feuding With Kris Jenner?,www.cheatsheet.com

The food and beverage license for , an East Grand Forks restaurant that Bushaw owns and operates, was suspended, effective Jan. 16, for 60 days by health department administrators for “serious and/or repeated violations” of executive orders 20-99 and 20-81. The first of those orders, which has since been relaxed, required Minnesota bars and restaurants like Bushaw’s to close to dine-in service for several weeks late last year. The second requires people statewide to wear masks while inside indoor businesses.

“I can barely even think, I’m just so mad,” he told the Herald and WDAY inside his otherwise empty restaurant. “I can’t sleep. They don’t realize what they’re doing to business owners and their employees.”

Bushaw, 19, expressed that frustration in a Facebook post on Thursday evening, declaring that he was looking for a spot in Grand Forks, where state leaders have taken a less restrictive approach to COVID-19 mitigation efforts. That attracted the notice of Grand Forks Mayor Brandon Bochenski, who offered to help. Bushaw, Bochenski and several high-ranking city administrators are set to meet Monday morning, and, since his post, Bushaw said he’d been fielding calls and other messages from property owners in Grand Forks offering to sell or rent spots for him to move his diner.

“I’d be happy if I was gone yesterday,” Bushaw said. “As soon as I can get out of here, I will.”

Joe’s Diner was one of a handful of businesses in Minnesota that reopened in mid-December despite Gov. Tim Walz’s closure orders, which were designed to slow the spread of coronavirus.

The governor’s ban on dine-in service went into effect Nov. 20 and, ultimately, was toned down Jan. 11. Despite the order, from Dec. 16 through Dec. 22, minus an interstitial Monday. A health department inspector noted that the diner was open on Dec. 17 and that a waitress there was not wearing a mask. A second inspection on Dec. 22, plus Facebook posts and news coverage, indicated the restaurant was open then, too. Both formed the basis for the suspension, according to correspondence from health department staff that Bushaw supplied to the Herald.

He received on Dec. 26 a cease-and-desist order from the state health department, dated Dec. 23, that required him to close for up to 72 hours and confirm with state officials he had done as much. Sent with that order was a notice, dated Dec. 24, that the diner’s food and beverage license will be suspended for 60 days.

Bushaw said he took that to mean that his license would be suspended if he didn’t close up shop, which he had already done a few days prior at that point.

About two weeks later, Bushaw reopened alongside bars and restaurants across Minnesota when Walz loosened his restriction on dine-in service. He figured he was in the clear, which is why Thursday’s letter came as a shock.

“It was maddening and out of nowhere,” Bushaw said.

Communications staff at the health department did not return Herald requests for comment on Friday, but the December correspondence from administrators there suggest that Bushaw had, from the day he received the letter informing him of the suspension, 20 days to wind down operations at the diner and, if he wanted to, contest the suspension. He did not contest the suspension in writing, which the materials he received on the 26th specifically required.

Jan. 15, the last day before the suspension began, is 20 days after Dec. 26, the day Bushaw said he received the letter.

He forwarded the health department documents to a lawyer, but did not hear back about them specifically, he said.

The diner also ran afoul of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose staff asked Bushaw to agree not to violate any current or future gubernatorial orders in exchange for not pursuing civil charges in Polk County court. Bushaw has thus far refused that agreement, but Ellison’s lawyers have only filed suit against the , another East Grand Forks eatery that opened despite Walz’s COVID-19 orders.

Joe’s Diner is down to Bushaw plus three other employees – a cook, a waiter and a dishwasher – and the business has missed out on about $120,000 to $180,000 worth of revenue during the closure order, he estimated.

“I shouldn’t have opened in the first place. I get it,” said Bushaw, who noted bitterly that health department staff haven’t missed a paycheck during the pandemic. “But I had no choice, really, but to open or I would have lost my business anyway, and my employees needed money for Christmas and for bills and whatever, so we opened up. And now, I thought it was all taken care of, good to go. They asked me to close, I closed, did what I had to do to make things correct, I guess you could say.”

He’s applied for financial help via an and a Polk County business grant program, but both aren’t set to pay out for weeks, and it might be too little, too late to keep the diner east of the river.

For the moment, Joe’s Diner is still open to customers, but Bushaw told WDAY he plans to close for good in East Grand Forks once the diner runs out of food. He expects that’ll happen before the end of the weekend.",Joe's Diner owner seeks a move to Grand Forks 'as soon as I can get out of here',www.grandforksherald.com

Viewers watched as Captain Lee opened up to chief stew Francesca Rubi about his son Joshua’s death. It was an emotional moment that left fans heartbroken for the infamous captain.

Kate, Connie, and the rest of the Below Deck Galley Talk crew commented on the emotional moment as they gave commentary on the most recent Below Deck episode.

There was oh so much for the Below Deck Galley Talk to dish regarding Below Deck Season 8. Rachel Hargrove’s drunken antics, the crew getting sick, and of course the dwindling boatmance between James Hough and Elizabeth Frankini.

However, just like with fans, the moment that left the group of alums speechless was Captain Lee opening up about his son Joshua’s death.

“Oh God, I can’t watch this,” Connie told Kate as the captain began speaking to Francesca.

Connie and Kate were moved to tears listening to how Captain Lee found his son and the impact that moment will forever have on his life.

Kate was there for the captain when he and his wife Mary Anne buried their youngest son in 2019. The former chief stew got emotional watching Captain Lee relive the loss.

“Gosh darn it, Captain Lee,” the former chief stew said to the TV screen.

Other Below Deck Galley Talk duos share their thoughts

While all eyes were, of course, on Kate and Connie because of Kate’s close relationship with Captain Lee, the other Below Deck and Below Deck Meds alums got emotional too.

Amy Johnson and her brother Kelley choked up as images of Captain Lee and Joshua flashed across the screen as the captain talked. Kelley also echoed Captain Lee’s sentiment that parents are not designed to bury their children.

Julia d’Albert Pusey watched along with Josiah Carter and described the moment as “heartbreaking.” Josiah remarked he wanted to reach out and hug Captain Lee.

The vulnerability of Captain Lee Rosbach opening up onscreen about losing his son to a drug overdose was not lost on those who know him and the fans who adore him.

Twitter was abuzz with love for captain after the moment initially aired on Below Deck and again after Below Deck Galley Talk. His heartbreaking story resonated with so many people.

323,324,https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/2021/01/23/cole-bridges-us-army-private-accused-supporting-isis-terrorism/6676539002/,"Cole Bridges said his family worried when they saw him posting Islamic State group propaganda on one of his social media sites, court records show.

“[N]obody knew I had contacts besides my family, but it was never confirmed,” Bridges told an FBI employee posing online as a female IS sympathizer. “They were suspicious.”

It’s not clear when the 20-year-old U.S. Army private — who lived with part of his family in Stow for a couple of months after he graduated from high school in another state —may have been radicalized.

But last fall, federal investigators say Bridges discussed targets for potential terror attacks in the United States, included the Sept. 11 memorial in New York City, and shared instructions for killing American troops in the Middle East.

More:Stow soldier allegedly plotted against other U.S. troops, posed with ISIS flag

When the U.S. Justice Department announced Bridges had been arrested and that he was from Stow, many longtime residents of this Akron suburb were puzzled because they didn’t know who Bridges was and figured out quickly that he had not attended local schools.

But Bridges apparently calls Stow his hometown after his mother and two little brothers moved there a couple of years ago from Clarksville, Tennessee, because Bridges’ stepfather wanted to live near his young daughter from a previous marriage.

A friend of the family said that Bridges —- who also lived at times with his father in Georgia — spent only a couple of months in Stow living at his mother’s and stepfather’s and working at a local Papa John’s pizza shop.

No one answered the door a the family's home this week when an Akron Beacon Journal reporter and photographer knocked.

But the family friend said Bridges — who sometimes used his mother's maiden name, Gonzales — was considered a polite, responsible and trustworthy teen.

In September 2019, Bridges followed in the steps of both his father and stepfather by enlisting in the Army. At least some extended family were unaware of Bridges’ apparent conversion to Islam and stunned by allegations he would support Islamic State extremists.

A Georgia attorney representing Bridges could not be reached this week.

Court documents show investigators have gathered information about Bridges for a little over a year.

The record begins on Christmas Day 2019 when Bridges searched the internet for “us soldier shooting,” “ak 47 downsight,” and “badass jihadi,” court records said.

In subsequent months, court records show Bridges also searched for “Suicide in Islam,” “Green Beret Ambush,” and posted images of IS propaganda and of himself on social media wearing a kaffiyeh (ghutra) and egal — a traditional red, plaid headscarf worn by many Arab men that’s held in place by two black, rope-like cords.

In October, court records show that an FBI employee posing as an Islamic State sympathizer, began communicating with Bridges on social media, asking why he deleted someone from his contact list.

Bridges said because the person made it sound easy to get out of the military, but “once someone signs that contract they basically signed their life away for the amount of years because they couldn’t find anything else in the civilian world,” court records said.

“I used to have connections with people in Hamas and Isis, and my family found out and the government could have arrested me,” Bridges continued. “So I needed to prove to them I wasn’t what they thought I was, and I needed the government to get off my back.”

A couple days later, the undercover FBI employee asked Bridges what he would do if his Army unit was confronted in combat by Islamic State fighters.

“I would probably go with the brothers,” Bridges replied, referring to the IS fighters, court records said.

A few days later, Bridges told the undercover FBI employee he has “skills not everyone else has.”

When asked if he had thought about sharing those skills with the “brothers,” the complaint said Bridges responded by saying, “Of course I have ... I can teach them ways of fighting, combat techniques, movements, formations, etc.”

As their conversations evolved, the FBI employee raised possible terror targets in the U.S., including the Sept. 11 memorial in New York City.

The FBI employee told Bridges her brother was a military vet who lived in New York and wanted to train for an operation.

“Sadly, I can’t participate,” Bridges said, but offered to help with training and his military expertise, court documents said.

In later conversations, Bridges said he didn’t agree with everything IS did, saying “they did too much innocent killing” and disagreed with suicide attacks, court documents said.

Later, in November, Bridges also told the undercover FBI employee that he thought it was inappropriate to attack in the U.S. because he considered that “offensive” jihad. He did, however, think it was “appropriate” to attack U.S. troops outside the U.S. because that was “defensive” jihad, court documents said.

Bridges then created and provided diagrams showing “specific tactical maneuvers and strategies that Islamic State should employ against U.S. forces, including rigging a compound with explosives for detonating when U.S. soldiers entered,” court document said.

In December, after Bridges’ Army unit returned to Georgia, Bridges continued to communicate with the undercover employee, the FBI said.

When the undercover FBI employee told Bridges to stay safe and avoid being “compromised” on Dec. 27, he responded by saying he’d “either become a martyr or somehow escape the country” if that happened, court records said.

Instead, less than a month later, he was under arrest.

Bridges faces two federal charges: attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State group and the attempted murder of U.S. military service members.

FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. this week said federal authorities prevented Bridges’ “evil desires from coming to fruition.”

“Bridges could have chosen a life of honorable service, but instead he traded it for the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence,” Sweeney said.

If convicted of both charges, Bridges faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, twice as many years as Bridges has lived.","Cole Bridges, U.S. Army private accused of supporting IS, has loose ties to Stow",www.beaconjournal.com

The new policy was coordinated with Seattle City Attorney Pete Holmes, Diaz said.

The announcement comes ahead of a planned protest Saturday afternoon at Occidental Park against ICE.

Diaz said that the department does not respond to many demonstrations because they are peaceful, but the damage caused downtown on Wednesday made it clear to him that some protesters weren’t promoting a specific cause and required a different response.

“I think everyone supports a level of demonstrations. It’s the ones in question where people have no direction and are creating property destruction without reason,” he said.

The protests Wednesday ended with several broken windows downtown at places including the original Starbucks store at Pike Place Market.

Diaz said that police have arrested around 600 people for various actions since last spring, and these often aren’t prosecuted. With the new policy, the city will prosecute more with those arrested several times for vandalism.

A standoff in 1992 between white separatists and federal agents in Ruby Ridge, Idaho. The 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people.

Right-wing extremism has previously played out for the most part in isolated pockets of America and in its smaller cities. The deadly assault by rioters on the U.S. Capitol, in contrast, targeted the very heart of government.

And it brought together, in large numbers, members of disparate groups, creating an opportunity for extremists to establish links with each other.

That, an expert says, potentially sets the stage for more violent actions.

“The events themselves, and participation in them, has a radicalizing effect. And they also have an inspirational effect. The battle of Capitol Hill is now part of the mythology,” said Brian Michael Jenkins, a terrorism expert and senior adviser to the president of the RAND Corporation think tank.

Mary McCord, a former acting U.S. assistant attorney general for national security, said the climate for the insurrection had been building throughout the Trump presidency.

She cited the 2017 “Unite the Right” white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that killed one person, aggressive demonstrations at statehouses by armed protesters railing against COVID-19 public health safety orders and mass shootings by people motivated by hate.

“All have led to this moment,” McCord, now a visiting law professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said in an email.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors U.S. extremists, has recorded a 55 percent increase in the number of white nationalist hate groups since 2017.

Among those who participated in the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol were members of the Oath Keepers, which often recruits current and former military, police or other first responders; the Proud Boys neo-fascist group; followers of QAnon, which spreads bizarre conspiracy theories; racists and anti-Semites; and others with nearly blind devotion to then-President Donald Trump.

“January 6th was kind of a Woodstock of the angry right,” Jenkins said in an interview. “The mere fact those groups were coming together, mingling, sharing this anger, displaying this passion – it is going to have effects.”

But what happens next? Will Jan. 6 be a high-water mark for right-wing extremists, or lead to other attacks on America’s democracy?

Right now, the movement – if it can be called that – seems to be on pause.

Supposedly planned armed protests at all 50 state capitals and Washington this past week that the FBI issued a nationwide warning about drew virtually no one. That could indicate the groups are demoralized, at least temporarily.

Trump is no longer president and his social media reach has been severely curtailed, with Twitter banning him. The extremists had come together in Washington on Jan. 6 because of their fervent belief in Trump’s lies that the presidential election had been stolen, and in response to Trump’s tweeted declaration that the protest in Washington “will be wild.”

But now, some are clearly angry that Trump disassociated himself with the very insurrection that he stoked. They’re upset that he failed to come to the rescue of rioters who were arrested while he was still president and are still being detained and charged.

Online, some people associated with the Proud Boys, which adored Trump, appear to have dumped him.

“No pardons for middle class whites who risked their livelihoods by going to ‘war’ for Trump,” a Telegram channel associated with the group said after Trump issued many pardons, but none for the insurrectionists.

Another posting on the channel said: “I cannot wait to watch the GOP completely collapse. Out of the ashes, a true nationalist movement will arise.”

Believers in QAnon are also reeling after Trump left office without fulfilling their baseless belief that he would vanquish a supposed cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibals, including top Democrats, operating a child sex trafficking ring.

Among them was Ron Watkins, who helps run an online messaging board about QAnon conspiracy theories.

“We gave it our all. Now we need to keep our chins up and go back to our lives as best we are able,” Watkins wrote on Telegram after President Joe Biden was sworn in and Trump flew off to Florida.

Jenkins said the next phase for the extremist groups and people who saw Trump as a savior could transform into a broader national movement in which factions coordinate and combine their assets.

Or the widespread condemnation of the insurrection could cause the movement to shrink, leaving more determined elements to strike out on their own and launch attacks.

Jenkins recalled the 1970s, when some anti-Vietnam War militants hardened into the Weather Underground, which launched a bombing campaign. Among places targeted were the U.S. Capitol and the Pentagon, but the only people who died were three militants who accidentally blew themselves up.

“I think given the events of this past year, and especially what we’ve seen in the last couple of months, this puts us into new territory,” Jenkins said “And you don’t put this back in the box that easily.”",Capitol attack reflects U.S. extremist evolution over decades,www.pressherald.com

The extremists had come together in Washington on Jan. 6 because of their fervent belief in Trump's lies that the presidential election had been stolen, and in response to Trump's tweeted declaration that the protest in Washington “will be wild.”

But now, some are clearly angry that Trump disassociated himself with the very insurrection that he stoked. They're upset that he failed to come to the rescue of rioters who were arrested while he was still president and are still being detained and charged.

Online, some people associated with the Proud Boys, which adored Trump, appear to have dumped him.

“No pardons for middle class whites who risked their livelihoods by going to ‘war' for Trump,"" a Telegram channel associated with the group said after Trump issued many pardons, but none for the insurrectionists.

Another posting on the channel said: “I cannot wait to watch the GOP completely collapse. Out of the ashes, a true nationalist movement will arise.”

Believers in QAnon are also reeling after Trump left office without fulfilling their baseless belief that he would vanquish a supposed cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibals, including top Democrats, operating a child sex trafficking ring.

Among them was Ron Watkins, who helps run an online messaging board about QAnon conspiracy theories.

“We gave it our all. Now we need to keep our chins up and go back to our lives as best we are able,” Watkins wrote on Telegram after President Joe Biden was sworn in and Trump flew off to Florida.

Jenkins said the next phase for the extremist groups and people who saw Trump as a savior could transform into a broader national movement in which factions coordinate and combine their assets.

Or the widespread condemnation of the insurrection could cause the movement to shrink, leaving more determined elements to strike out on their own and launch attacks.

Jenkins recalled the 1970s, when some anti-Vietnam War militants hardened into the Weather Underground, which launched a bombing campaign. Among places targeted were the U.S. Capitol and the Pentagon, but the only people who died were three militants who accidentally blew themselves up.

“I think given the events of this past year, and especially what we’ve seen in the last couple of months, this puts us into new territory,"" Jenkins said ""And you don't put this back in the box that easily.""

328,329,https://www.rep-am.com/news/world/2021/01/23/2600-arrested-at-protests-demanding-navalnys-release/,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian police arrested more than 2,600 people Saturday in nationwide protests demanding the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin’s most prominent foe, according to a group that counts political detentions.

The protests in scores of cities in temperatures as low as minus-50 C (minus-58 F) highlighted how Navalny has built influence far beyond the political and cultural centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg.

In Moscow, an estimated 15,000 demonstrators gathered in and around Pushkin Square in the city center, where clashes with police broke out and demonstrators were roughly dragged off by helmeted riot officers to police buses and detention trucks. Some were beaten with batons.

Navalny’s wife Yulia was among those arrested.

Police eventually pushed demonstrators out of the square. Thousands then regrouped along a wide boulevard about a kilometer (half-mile) away, many of them throwing snowballs at the police before dispersing.

Some later went to protest near the jail where Navalny is held. Police made an undetermined number of arrests there.

The protests stretched across Russia’s vast territory, from the island city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk north of Japan and the eastern Siberian city of Yakutsk, where temperatures plunged to minus-50 Celsius, to Russia’s more populous European cities. Navalny and his anti-corruption campaign have built an extensive network of support despite official government repression and being routinely ignored by state media.

“The situation is getting worse and worse, it’s total lawlessness,” said Andrei Gorkyov, a protester in Moscow. “And if we stay silent, it will go on forever.”

The OVD-Info group, which monitors political arrests, said at least 1,045 people were detained in Moscow and more than 375 at another large demonstration in St. Petersburg.

Overall, it said 2,662 people had been arrested in some 90 cities, revising the count downward from its earlier report of 3,445. The group, which conducts its count through regional associates and runs a hotline for information, did not give an explanation for its revision. Russian police did not provide arrest figures.

Undeterred, Navalny’s supporters called for protests again next weekend.

Navalny was arrested on Jan. 17 when he returned to Moscow from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a severe nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin and which Russian authorities deny. Authorities say his stay in Germany violated terms of a suspended sentence in a 2014 criminal conviction, while Navalny says the conviction was for made-up charges.

The 44-year-old activist is well known nationally for his reports on the corruption that has flourished under President Vladimir Putin’s government.

His wide support puts the Kremlin in a strategic bind — officials are apparently unwilling to back down by letting him go free, but keeping him in custody risks more protests and criticism from the West.

In a statement, the U.S. State Department condemned “the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists this weekend in cities throughout Russia” and called on Russian authorities to immediately release Navalny and all those detained at protests.

Navalny faces a court hearing in early February to determine whether his sentence in the criminal case for fraud and money-laundering — which Navalny says was politically motivated — is converted to 3 1/2 years behind bars.

Moscow police on Thursday arrested three top Navalny associates, two of whom were later jailed for periods of nine and 10 days.

Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on Aug. 20. He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to the Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.

Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning. Russia refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned.

Last month, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as fake.

Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side for a decade, unusually durable in an opposition movement often demoralized by repressions.

He has been jailed repeatedly in connection with protests and twice was convicted of financial misdeeds in cases that he said were politically motivated. He suffered significant eye damage when an assailant threw disinfectant into his face. He was taken from jail to a hospital in 2019 with an illness that authorities said was an allergic reaction but which many suspected was a poisoning.","2,600 arrested at protests demanding Navalny’s release",www.rep-am.com

MOSCOW, Jan 24 — Police clashed violently with protesters in Moscow and arrested more than 2,500 demonstrators in cities across the country yesterday as Russians took to the streets to denounce Kremlin rule and demand the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

Tens of thousands nationwide answered Navalny’s call to rally, issued after he was detained at a Moscow airport on arrival from Germany, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal poisoning with a nerve agent.

Washington and Brussels condemned the arrests and other tactics used against demonstrators, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saying the bloc would discuss “next steps” tomorrow.

Yesterday’s protests took on an unprecedented geographic scale, spanning more than 100 cities across the country. Previous large-scale opposition demonstrations in 2012 and 2019 were largely centralised in Moscow.

They were also being seen as a test of the opposition’s ability to mobilise ahead of parliamentary elections later this year, despite increasing Kremlin pressure on critics.

In Moscow, protesters spilled out over Pushkin Square and pelted heavily armed riot police with snowballs. They were beaten back by law enforcement wielding batons and detained in large numbers.

The demonstrators marched towards the Kremlin before dispersing, and at one point massed on the steps of Moscow’s circus, illuminating the crowds with hundreds of cell phone lights and pummelling a police van with snowballs.

“Criminals dressed in uniforms are protecting criminals at the helm,” Vera Spivakova, a 71-year-old pensioner, told AFP in Moscow.

“Putin and the oligarchs are afraid of losing their trough,” she said.

OVD Info, which monitors opposition rallies, said that more than 2,500 protesters had been seized by police in dozens of cities.

Among more than 950 detained in the capital were Navalny’s wife Yulia Navalnaya — who was later released — and prominent activist Lyubov Sobol. Several Navalny associates were also fined and jailed on the eve of the protest.

The European Union’s Borrell said he deplored “widespread arrests” and the “disproportionate use of force”.

Meanwhile US State Department spokesman Ned Price said Washington “strongly condemns the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists”.

Navalny being taken into custody and the arrests of more than 2,500 of his supporters were “troubling indications of further restrictions on civil society and fundamental freedoms,” he added.

On placards and in chants, protesters referenced an investigation published this week by Navalny into an opulent Black Sea property allegedly owned by Putin. The two-hour report has been viewed more than 70 million times on YouTube.

Later Saturday hundreds gathered outside Moscow’s high-security prison where Navalny is being held but were pushed back by police.

Leonid Volkov, who heads Navalny’s regional network, estimated that as many as 300,000 people had joined the “unprecedented” nationwide protests, and called for fresh rallies next weekend.

The Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said in a statement it had launched several preliminary probes into violence against law enforcement.

AFP journalists, who saw badly injured protesters retreating behind other demonstrators after clashing with police, estimated crowds in Moscow at some 20,000 people, with more than 10,000 in second city Saint Petersburg.

Navalny’s detention drew sharp condemnation from Western countries, and the US embassy in Moscow yesterday accused Russian authorities of “suppressing” the right of demonstrators to peaceful protest.

Moscow hit back by alleging US diplomats had published protest routes in advance of yesterday’s demonstrations and of promoting a “march on the Kremlin”.

“Senior officials in the US embassy will have to have a serious conversation with the Russian foreign ministry,” it said in a statement.

Earlier yesterday thousands took to the streets in the Far East, Siberia and the Urals including Khabarovsk, Novosibirsk and Yekaterinburg, despite sub zero temperatures and police warnings of a swift crackdown.

In Saint Petersburg, where police detained nearly 300 demonstrators, 20-year-old Alexei Skvortsov told AFP that he no longer wanted to live in a “dictatorship”.

“People are tired of Putin,” he said.

In Yakutsk south of the Arctic Circle, protesters wrapped up against the cold and rallied in temperatures of minus 50 degrees Celsius (-58 Fahrenheit).

Russia’s media watchdog warned online platforms against encouraging minors to participate in the rallies or risk hefty fines.

A hastily organised court on Monday jailed Navalny for 30 days for allegedly flouting parole conditions.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed to the timing of the deal after the House impeached Trump Jan. 13 for inciting the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol a week earlier.

Earlier in the day, Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the impeachment article would be sent to the Senate Monday, officially triggering the trial process.

Lawmakers had gone back and forth over the timing of the trial, with McConnell arguing the trial needed to be delayed until mid-February in order to give Trump time to prepare, and some Democrats saying a trial delay would give the Senate time to confirm President Joe Biden's Cabinet nominees.

McConnell spokesperson Doug Andres said the Kentucky Republican was ""glad"" Schumer agreed to their request to delay the trial. The additional weeks to prepare were ""a win for due process and fairness,"" Andres said.

The article will be presented to the Senate on Monday, when the House impeachment managers, or the lawmakers assigned to present the case against Trump, will walk them over to the Senate. Senators will then be sworn in for a court of impeachment the following day. Trump and Democrats will have the next two weeks to file their initial arguments, with the trial beginning the week of Feb. 8.

The timing on when the House would transmit the impeachment article had been left in the air as the Senate changed from Republican to Democratic control and worked to quickly confirm several of Biden's Cabinet nominees. Schumer and McConnell have also continued to discuss a power-sharing agreement, since the chamber is split evenly, and the framework for how a trial will operate.

""This impeachment began with an unprecedentedly fast and minimal process in the House,"" McConnell said Friday. ""The sequel cannot be an insufficient Senate process that denies former President Trump his due process or damages the Senate or the presidency itself.""

McConnell said Trump deserved a ""full and fair process"" for his impeachment trial.

Pelosi, in a statement, applauded the work of the nine House Democrats serving as impeachment managers and highlighted Congress' ""solemn duty.""

Pelosi downplayed GOP concerns that Trump did not have enough time to prepare for the trial, arguing ""the former president will have had the same amount of time to prepare for trial as our Managers.""

""We are respectful of the Senate’s constitutional power over the trial and always attentive to the fairness of the process,"" Pelosi said. ""Our Managers are ready to begin to make their case to 100 Senate jurors through the trial process.""

The School Committee’s disciplinary action is in response to an investigation and report that indicates he harassed School Department employees, according to anonymous sources.

The terms of Malone’s amended contract were released Friday afternoon in a statement from the School Committee and through its attorney, Bruce Assad.

The reduction in Malone’s salary amounts to a total of $16,917 and there are other marked changes to the contract.

The School Committee can terminate Malone without cause and rather than compensating him at departure with six months' pay, the amount is reduced to three months' pay.

The school board has the right to terminate Malone without any compensation “if there are credible allegations of bullying or harassment of any employee of the School Department.”

A fourth term of the contract, the School Committee has the right to send Malone to undergo an independent medical examination to determine if he is capable of performing the functions of his job “should a question of fitness arise in the future.""

Earlier this month in a majority vote, School Committee members voted on the amendments to Malone’s contract in closed session.

In November, in another closed-door meeting, committee members vote retain Malone to run the Fall River School District which has over 10,000 students and 2,000 staff.

In both votes, sources indicated that there was a 4-to-2 vote, with School Committee members Kevin Aguiar and Paul Hart voting to fire Malone instead of amending his contract.

Voting in the affirmative in each session were Vice Chairman Mark Costa and members Joshua Hetzler, Thomas Khoury and Mimi Larrivee.

Mayor Paul Coogan, who is chairman of the School Committee and whose brother, Thomas Coogan, is the School Department’s executive director of human resources and is supervised by Malone, recused himself from the vote after an advisement by the State Ethics Commission.

November’s vote came after the completion of a $25,000 investigation into numerous claims of harassment by school staff against Malone. The School Committee hired an outside law firm to investigate the claims that were made in September.

Several sources close to the investigation said the report shows Malone harassed a School Department employee who has physical disabilities, calling him “retard” and other insults and referred to female employees inappropriate names.

Meanwhile, some members of the City Council this week expressed criticism over the School Committee’s decision with the potential for lawsuits and complaints to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination during a Committee on Finance on Tuesday.

School Department Vice Chairman Mark Costa hit back in a statement to The Herald News, saying “Their decision to discuss a School Department personnel issue during their meeting, in my opinion was inappropriate. Inappropriate, because no City Councilor has all of the facts and contextual information about the personnel matter and how it was handled by the School Committee.”

Friday’s statement appeared to address the City Council’s criticism: “any failure of the School Committee to terminate Superintendent Malone will result in lawsuits is flatly not true.”

“To the contrary, the School Committee acted appropriately and in accordance with the law by investigating the issues immediately and taking appropriate disciplinary and remedial action. Moreover, any allegation that the School Committee acted inappropriately by not placing the Superintendent on administrative leave is baseless.” the statement continues.

The School Committee indicated that if it had placed Malone on administrative leave, they would have had to continue to pay the superintendent and there would be an added cost of temporarily replacing him during the investigation.

“Due to the prompt and decisive action by the Committee, this matter was resolved fairly and in the best interests of the School Department, its employees and the children of Fall River,” according to the statement.

At this point is it unclear if the School Committee’s decision to not terminate Malone may lead to lawsuits, but during Tuesday’s City Council meeting, City Councilor Shawn Cadime said the matter would likely be taken to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.

A spokesman for MCAD could not confirm if any complaint had been lodged against Malone or the city due to confidentiality laws and pending the completion of any investigation.

While not going into the specifics of his reported bad behavior with school staff, Malone did apologize in an interview with The Herald News, saying that in August he “broke the tenets of our core values by behaving in a manner that disrupted the team work of our central office and hurt the feelings of our professional community.”",How Malone's contract was amended in wake of harrassment allegations,www.heraldnews.com

However, they say it was the right thing to do given the information they had at the time.

At one point, the Department of Public Safety estimated there would be at least 500 protesters at the Utah Capitol on Jan. 17. Col. Michael Rapich estimates they spent $227,000 to boost security around the complex on that day, alone. They based their decision on what they saw both in Utah and in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, and based on information they were receiving from all across the country. That information reportedly showed Trump-supporting groups were planning breaches at statehouses all over the U.S.

Rapich says, ""A lot of that seemed to be associating groups we had seen both here in Utah and back at the nation's Capitol.""

A lot of the information from national news outlets suggested protesters would come to Salt Lake City to specifically target our Capitol building. Rapich says the news outlets weren't the only ones reporting this. Posts they saw on social media suggested the same thing.

""That was being corroborated,"" he says. ""We had information both locally that we were generating through our sources, and we were getting information from our federal partners, as well.""

In the end, fewer than two dozen people came to the Capitol, and those that did protested peacefully. Given what they were told, Rapich says the show of force at the complex was the right strategy.

""If we waited to see what happened, we definitely would not have had time to deploy the resources,"" he says.

Public safety officials in Utah consulted with law enforcement from other parts of the country, and everyone reportedly came to the same conclusion.

He says, ""We were very, very consistent, across the country, with the way pretty much every state was interpreting the same information, and our preparations were very consistent with what other states were doing.""

Rapich says several things could have changed after protesters originally proposed to breach statehouses. It's possible the ""chatter"" they were seeing was wrong, plus, protest organizers seemed to have backed down, not wanting to be connected with more destruction.",DPS spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to protect Utah Capitol from riots that didn't happen,www.ksl.com

342,343,https://www.newsweek.com/83-percent-americans-support-wearing-masks-only-half-wear-them-poll-1563944,"An overwhelming 83 percent majority of American adults say wearing a mask is an effective way to protect themselves and others from COVID-19, but in practice, only 51 percent of people said they wear a facial covering in public.

Researchers at the University of Southern California's Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research polled more than 6,000 U.S. adults to better understand how Americans have responded to pandemic changes. The study revealed that the beliefs of several thousands of Americans regarding masks don't necessarily carry over to their actual behavior. Half of U.S. adults who had engaged in ""close contact with non-household members"" over the past week said they wore a mask during such rendezvous outside their residence. Slightly less, 47 percent, said they wore a mask when gathering with 10 or more people at an event.

The most common activity Americans reported doing outside the home was grocery shopping, where 90 percent of respondents said they wore a mask.

Two-thirds of the adults reported being in ""close contact,"" less than six feet away, with people outside their household in December. But among those people, only about half said that they mostly or always wore a mask while interacting with others. Only 14 percent of respondents said they gathered in a group of 10 or more people in the past seven days. But fewer than half of them wore a mask at all or at any point during their activity.

The issue of mask-wearing has remained a contentious source of anxiety, with many Americans following CDC health guidance and others challenging the science that says it slows the spread of the virus. California Governor Gavin Newsom was among many government officials who were chastised for issuing stay-at-home orders while simultaneously exhibiting hypocritical mask-wearing practices. Among those surveyed, only 42 percent of people living in rural areas who went out in public said they wore a mask during close contact with others.

""Of the 4 in 10 Americans who visited someone else's home, only 21% wore a mask most or all of the time they were together,"" the researchers wrote. ""Though a large majority of Americans believe wearing a mask is an effective way to protect themselves from COVID-19, many still don't wear them — including three in 10 Angelenos [Los Angeles residents].""

The USC Dornsife researchers conducted parallel research on adult residents of Los Angeles County between December 9 and January 6 to provide an in-depth look at hyper-local demographic differences compared with reactions nationally. The study highlighted several ""large differences based on race and locale.""

White Americans were the least likely to consistently wear masks (46 percent) while in close contact with people who live outside their households. By comparison, 67 percent of Black Americans reported always or mostly wearing masks alongside 63 percent of Latinos surveyed who said the same. On a national level, 90 percent of respondents said they wear masks when shopping for groceries, compared to just 22 percent who say they put on a facial covering when exercising outdoor.

Additional sequencing continues for other possible cases already positive for COVID-19.

Officials have also named possible exposure sites, adding that residents should take precautions because the B117 variant is much more easily transmitted.

You should be tested if you were at the above locations at the specified times.

“The possibility of additional spread of the variant is a concern,” says Juan Luis Marquez, MD, MPH, medical director with Washtenaw County Health Department. “At this point and with the guidance of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, we are encouraging extra precautions. Seek testing if you have symptoms, have recently been exposed to COVID-19, or have recently traveled to a place where the new variant is circulating. And everyone should make sure they are using all COVID-19 precautions consistently. This includes face masks, social distancing, hand cleaning, avoiding crowds or gatherings, and following isolation and quarantine guidance.”

The first Michigan case of the COVID-19 variant was identified in a woman back on Jan. 16. Officials say it's unclear if that case is linked to the most recent cases.

Symptoms may include: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headaches, loss of taste, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting and diarrhea.

“We have been warning people for weeks that this variant would likely be identified in the State of Michigan,” says Dr Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive and chief deputy for health at MDHHS. “We want everyone to understand that this variant is much more easily transmitted, and there is increased risk of rapid spread. Now is the time for people to take additional precautions and limit any potential exposures.

346,347,https://www.940wfaw.com/news/families-say-more-should-have-been-done-after-3-murders-at-new-york-city-housing-complex/,"(NEW YORK) — Three families mourning the loss of their matriarchs are questioning why more wasn’t done to protect the residents of their senior housing complex after a man was arrested for their murders this week.

Kevin Gavin, 66, was charged Friday with three counts of second-degree murder for the killings, which spanned from 2015 to last week and occurred in the victims’ apartments, authorities said.

Gavin was identified as a suspect during the investigation of the second homicide, but it wasn’t until the murder on Jan. 15 that investigators said they were able to connect him to all three, police said.

The suspect would run errands for some of the elderly tenants who lived in the building, run by New York City’s public housing authority, NYCHA, police said.

“He had a relationship with our victims,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison said during a media briefing Thursday.

Investigators believe the killings began as arguments about money. Gavin allegedly confessed to all three murders, prosecutors said in court Friday.

The first victim, Myrtle McKinney, 82, was found dead inside her apartment at the Woodson Houses on Nov. 9, 2015, by her home health aide. At first, it was thought she died of natural causes, but a medical examiner discovered a stab wound on her neck, authorities said. The homicide case remained open with few leads, Harrison said. In court documents, prosecutors said that Gavin told them he stabbed McKinney with a steak knife.

The second victim, Jacolia James, 83, was also found dead inside her apartment. Her grandson found her lying face down on April 30, 2019. She had suspicious injuries to her face and neck, and her official cause of death was strangulation. Gavin allegedly told prosecutors he choked her and “stomped on her neck three times.”

Based on forensic evidence, Gavin became a suspect in James’ murder and, by connection, McKinney’s, but there wasn’t enough evidence to arrest him at the time, police said. Last year, Gavin moved into his late brother’s apartment in the building after he died.

The most recent homicide victim was killed nine months later. On Jan. 15, Juanita Caballero, 78, was found dead on the floor of her apartment with a telephone cord wrapped around her neck, authorities said. Her cause of death was strangulation.

Detectives were able to connect Gavin to all three murders based on evidence from the most recent homicide, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said during the briefing Thursday.

“Prior to that, the pattern of deaths in those houses could not be clearly linked to an individual,” Gonzalez said. “After this unfortunate last killing, we were able to make a pretty definitive link to [Gavin].”

Gonzalez said that the arrest “will have a profound impact on public safety in Brooklyn.” Though local leaders and the victims’ family members are charging that more should have been done to protect residents of the complex following McKinney’s murder in 2015.

“We’re calling on the city, state and national resources to look into all of these murders, homicides, that were here,” Councilwoman Inez Barron said Thursday during a press briefing with the victims’ family members. “This has been a string of deaths that have occurred in a senior development, and we’re saying the NYPD has been negligent … and not put resources into solving these crimes in a timely manner.”

Juanita Caballero’s son, Steven Caballero, who discovered her body, said he is “heartbroken” over her murder and claimed that her building lacked significant security measures, such as cameras.

“NYCHA failed our families. They failed the McKinney family. They failed the James family. They failed my mother,” said Steven Caballero. “They had time to do something, they just won’t do nothing. I don’t know what it’s going to take for them to just put these cameras in the building.”

His family plans to sue NYCHA over the security measures, the New York Daily News reported. The daughter of Jacolia James also filed suit against NYCHA last year, according to the paper.

“This building has no cameras. We need cameras. We need ’em now,” Lamarr Crafton, the grandson of Jacolia James, said Thursday.

ABC News has reached out to NYCHA for comment on the cases and why Gavin was able to move into the building. The housing authority told New York ABC station WABC that the building currently has a security camera in the lobby, security doors and locks, and a security guard.

Harrison said police are now investigating other deaths in the building.

The 66-year-old was arrested for the murders of three women at NYCHA’s Carter Woodson senior housing development in Brownsville.

The murders of Gavin’s victims spanned from 2015 to last week and took place in each of the victims’ apartments, ABC News reports.

Gavin was initially a suspect in the investigation into the homicide of the second victim. However, the NYPD didn’t connect him to all of the cases until the murder of the third victim on Jan. 15.

Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez believes Gavin’s arrest “will have a profound impact on public safety in Brooklyn.”

However, during a Thursday press briefing, Councilwoman Inez Barron stood with the families of the victims and called out the NYPD for failing to protect residents after the first murder in 2015.

“This has been a string of deaths that have occurred in a senior development, and we’re saying the NYPD has been negligent ... and not put resources into solving these crimes in a timely manner.”

Gavin, who has been described as a handyman around the complex, faces three counts of second-degree murder charges, CBS New York reports.

In court documents, Gavin allegedly confessed to pushing Myrtle McKenny, 82, who died of a puncture to the neck in 2015, into a table with a steak knife on it.

Along with admitting to choking Jacolia James, 83, and stomping on her neck in 2019, Gavin also confessed to the murder of Juanita Cabarello, who he allegedly strangled with a telephone cord.

348,349,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/1/23/22241478/lawmakers-open-session-with-masks-and-extra-security-make-first-move-on-tax-cuts,"SALT LAKE CITY — They came with masks on their faces, proof of negative COVID-19 tests in their pockets and safety on their minds as Utah’s state senators and representatives opened the 2021 Legislature this week in a well-guarded Capitol on heightened alert for protesters.

For the first week of the session, the Capitol was off-limits to the general public due to security concerns in light of the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol by right-wing extremists protesting presidential election results. Calls for protests at state capitols leading up to Inauguration Day on Wednesday prompted Utah Gov. Spencer Cox to declare an emergency, close the complex to visitors and have National Guard troops help Utah Highway Patrol troopers protect the grounds.

But no major demonstrations materialized in Salt Lake City, and Utah lawmakers went about their business with optimism and a sense of purpose to get beyond the COVID-19 crisis still plaguing the state and country.

“Beyond the physical effects of COVID, the global pandemic has caused widespread economic hardship, social disruption and mental health issues. Discouraging news about the pandemic, natural disasters and civil unrest have seemed to arrive at a tempo that left moments of reprieve few and far between,” House Speaker Brad Wilson, R-Kaysville, said in his opening day speech on the House floor Tuesday.

“But in the midst of all this tragedy, we have seen Utahns facing adversity with determination, overcoming challenges with innovation, and lifting others with compassion,” Wilson said.

Lawmakers are working under COVID-19 restrictions that include a mask requirement, a handshake ban and required weekly testing for the novel coronavirus. Nevertheless, at least three people — none of them lawmakers — tested positive for the virus, it was learned Friday.

On Thursday night, Cox gave his first State of the State address in the House chamber, cautioning senators and representatives to be wary of “foundational cracks” that threaten the state.

Cox talked of the state’s “unprecedented” growth rate, and all the challenges that have come with it, calling air quality, transportation, water, housing “all the types of foundational cracks that could derail our success and the opportunities for future generations.”

Cox said he’s concerned that a “high-quality education” is not happening in “every corner of our state,” calling again for legislators to tackle “tough choices” around equalizing education funding so taxpayers and students receive quality education regardless of their ZIP codes.

He said it’s “the key to unlocking intergenerational poverty. It’s the key to disrupting the criminal justice pipeline. It’s the key to unlocking the American dream. And it’s the right thing to do.”

The last “foundational crack” that Cox addressed was “that of contempt, tribalism and discord that has rocked our nation over the past few weeks.”

He reminded lawmakers of the oath of office he and they have taken, “to uphold the Constitution of the United States,” and urged them to set examples of unity and strive for mutual respect and “civic charity” in public discourse.

In one of the first significant moves in the chambers, the Senate unanimously passed SB11, a bill that would use about $43 million out of the $80 million already set aside for tax cuts to reduce income taxes for Utahns on Social Security and military retirement.

Lawmakers have also talked about an across-the-board income tax cut and an increase in the state’s existing tax credit for dependents to reverse some harms from federal tax law changes in recent years.

Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said cutting taxes this year is a “top priority.”

“After a difficult year, we felt it important to get money back into the hands of Utahns,” Adams said in a statement.

If approved by the House and signed by Cox, SB11 will reduce tax burdens on nearly 67,000 Utahns on fixed incomes, including those who make $48,000 a year or less as a couple or $24,000 or less as an individual on Social Security income. It would reduce their burden by an average of $298 a year in a Social Security credit. It would also provide a tax credit for nearly 18,100 veterans on military pensions, a tax cut of about $1,315 on average.

A variety of other issues also reached headlines in the opening days, including:

A bill creating a process to ensure residents who die are quickly removed from voter registration rolls passed the House unanimously on Wednesday.

“Typically, deceased individuals do not receive a ballot in the mail, but I have heard of several cases where it has happened,” HB12 sponsor Rep. Mike Winder, R-West Valley City, said.

HB12 would require that once a death certificate is issued, notification to county clerks must be done within five business days. Once the clerk receives that death certificate, they have one day to remove the dead person’s name and information from the voter rolls.

Move to have medical examiner review killings by police advances

Amid dozens of reform bills concerning law enforcement officers’ use of force, the first bill on the topic to see legislative action would require the chief medical examiner to investigate deaths resulting directly from actions of a law enforcement officer.

The bill also assigns a criminal charge for anyone who knowingly provides misinformation to the medical examiner or the medical examiner’s office. It specifies that anyone who certifies the cause of death other than the medical examiner or their designee will face a class B misdemeanor charges.

“We have an excellent qualified medical examiner. Our law enforcement, this bill is not aimed at them in any way, they behave very well. Our goal is to ensure public confidence,” said the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Merrill Nelson, R-Grantsville.

A Utah bill that would allow concealed carrying of firearms without a permit prompted debate Friday among some who believe it will promote individuals’ safety and others who fear it will prove deadly amid the mental health crisis.

“This is not just a left issue or right issue,” bill sponsor Rep. Walt Brooks, R-St. George, said during a House Judiciary Committee meeting. “This is good data that drives good policy. ... The right to carry or protect yourself is a constitutional right.”

He said studies in some of the 16 states that allow concealed carrying of firearms without a permit have shown no increase in crime. Law-abiding citizens will still seek out gun training on their own should the bill pass, according to Brooks.

HB60’s language mirrors legislation Brooks filed in the final days of the 2020 session, which would remove the state’s requirement for law-abiding Utahns over the age of 21 to have a permit to legally carry a concealed firearm.

Rep. Mark Wheatley, D-Murray, said he’s concerned that the bill could cause danger to people of color who choose to carry a concealed gun.

“I’ve seen where individuals are pulled over or possibly stereotyped because they have a gun,” Wheatley said, adding that police officers might assume that some are “using it for the wrong reasons,” causing the gun owner to suffer consequences.

Rep. Brian King, D-Salt Lake City, said he believes the number of guns in people’s possessions will likely rise if requirements decrease, leading to more accidental discharges and creating more risk for those going through mental health crises.

Utah could get its own Space Force

HB57, sponsored by Rep. Jefferson Burton, R-Salem, would add “Space Force” to the definition of armed forces in Utah code, along with the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.

The bill would enable Hill Air Force Base and the Utah National Guard to have opportunities to be a part of the United States Space Force, the space services branch of the U.S. armed forces created by former President Donald Trump.

After a recent tragedy, a Utah legislator wants to limit the supply of opioids a doctor can prescribe to a patient after surgery. Rep. Ray Ward, R-Bountiful, who works as a doctor, said he was on call for his practice when he was asked to sign a death certificate for a woman who had undergone surgery weeks earlier.

“There were three different prescribers who were providing three different sedative medications to her. All apparently were OK that someone else was prescribing them. And that particular night, that was just too many medicines and she stopped breathing,” Ward told members of the House Health and Human Services Committee on Thursday.

While in most cases doctors can only prescribe up to a seven-day supply of opiates if it’s the patient’s first prescription, there’s an exemption in Utah law that allows for a 30-day supply after surgeries. HB15 would remove that exemption and only allow doctors to prescribe a larger supply in complicated cases.

A lawmaker’s proposal to make Utah the first state to train emergency medical technicians specifically for responding to mental health emergencies received early support in a state Senate committee Wednesday.

SB53 would allow EMTs and firefighters to be trained to respond to mental health calls. Then, agencies throughout the state could form teams made up of those trained EMTs, who would be dedicated specifically to mental health emergencies.

Bill sponsor Sen. Daniel Thatcher, R-West Valley City, said he believes Utah will be the first state to implement such a program.

“I believe that this will absolutely change the way that we provide service to those experiencing substance use or mental health issues,” Thatcher told members of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee on Wednesday.

Republican Sen. Todd Weiler says he is “thrilled” the Salt Lake City Board of Education voted this week to resume in-person learning in its middle and high schools starting Feb. 8, but he is proceeding with SB107 that would require the State School Board to reallocate a portion of per-pupil funding from a school district that does not provide a broad-based in-person learning option for all students in kindergarten through grade 12 by Feb. 8.

It is more a measure to hold the school district to the commitment it made to reopen secondary schools starting next month, he said.

The Senate Education Committee voted 5-2 Wednesday to forward the bill to the full Senate, where Weiler said the bill may sit and wait as an insurance policy that the Salt Lake School District makes good on its promise to reopen classrooms.

Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew Durrant said Tuesday in the annual State of the Judiciary address to the Legislature that a goal for justice system is to return to in-person trials.

Despite a set of “daunting and difficult decisions” brought on by COVID-19, Durrant said, court staff and judges have “risen to the challenge and more.”

The court system moved almost completely online with virtual hearings and trials by mid-April as the disease spread across the state. Trials throughout 2020 involved over 400,000 virtual participants, Durrant said, enabling the judiciary to largely keep pace with its pre-pandemic case load. But some cases are taking longer to resolve, creating “a considerable backlog.”

The judicial system has been working with the University of Utah Health chief medical officer and chief epidemiologist to find ways to safely resume in-person jury trials, he said.

New week will see the general public back in the Capitol

Utah’s Capitol will reopen to the public for in-person participation in the 2021 legislative session on Monday, lawmakers announced Friday evening.

Masks and 6-foot social distancing will still be required by everyone inside of the Capitol. Space in committee rooms will be limited. Even though in-person participation will be allowed, legislative leaders still encouraged Utahns to participate virtually.

Additionally, Utah Highway Patrol troopers will be stationed at each of the Capitol’s four public entrances to conduct bag checks. They’ll also stand guard at committee meetings to “protect the public, staff and elected officials,” a news release stated.

Lawmakers are just beginning the nearly seven-week session that closes on March 5. Next week will see days full of committee meetings to begin vetting the hundreds of bills that will cross legislators’ desks.

As of Friday, at least 361 bills have been filed.

During their speeches, the leaders of the House and Senate highlighted a variety of legislative priorities for this session, including education funding, reviewing business regulations, infrastructure investment, mental health programs and the balance of power between the lawmaking and executive branches, particularly in times of emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

No timetables have been set for when certain topics will be addressed.","A look back: Utah lawmakers open session with masks, extra security; make move on tax cuts",www.deseret.com

350,351,https://www.grandforksherald.com/entertainment/books/6738985-ND-girls-book-to-raise-money-for-clean-water-in-Africa-reaches-international-markets,"The West Fargo, N.D., girl's favorite classes at Fargo's Oak Grove Lutheran School are social studies and art — she likes history and loves to draw. She was glad in-person classes could resume this fall because she didn't want to do school online again this year.

But while she's keeping up with homework and middle school life this fall, Anderson also became something remarkable for someone her age — a translated author and philanthropist whose children's book is now selling on the international market and making a difference far away from West Fargo.

It all started when she learned about the need for clean drinking water in Zambia.

A group of board members for Wellspring for the World, a nonprofit that raises money and funds projects to provide safe drinking water for people around the world, were also members of the local Hope Lutheran Church. They suggested to the church that they do a Lenten offering, and a group of 10 people decided to travel to Zambia and see the work in action.

That group included Anderson's father, Mark, who returned home and told his daughter about some of the things he saw there — and she was motivated to raise a ""little bit"" of money to help.

""Her comment was, 'That's not fair. Every kid should have water,'"" he said.

Anderson decided she would make and sell $50 of cookies to donate toward helping those kids. That effort grew into almost $5,000 of cookie sales, and as her story and mission got around the community, people wanted to contribute even more.

""I thought it was just going to be a little bit at first,"" she said. ""I'm really glad it turned into something bigger, but I wasn't expecting it.""

Anderson also started making chitenge bags, which are tote bags made from scraps of African wax fabric in vibrant patterns, and has sold more than 400 to further help the cause, according to her dad.

But it's the book she wrote and illustrated, ""Water Works,"" that is making the biggest impact around the world.

Since it was released in June 2019, the book has sold more than 8,500 copies in America. In September 2019, the book was published in English for release in Zambia, and more than 1,000 copies were distributed to Zambian schools.

Most recently, a newly translated version was published in Vietnam this fall, and it's already sold more than 2,200 copies there.

In addition to the money raised from the book's purchase, agreements with other organizations, including Wellspring and World Vision, means it has raised and been matched with funding to provide more than $750,000 toward the cause so far. That money has been used to build more than 50 wells and provide water to 15,000 people, according to Mark.

He said his daughter made 96 presentations to area churches, service clubs, schools and businesses about the book and the mission to provide clean drinking water from the time the book came out until the COVID-19 pandemic reached the region in the spring.

Anderson said she's only written this one book so far, and she's not sure if she'll write another someday. Right now, she's just seeing where ""Water Works"" goes as it continues to be read by more people.

She hasn't been able to travel to Zambia yet to see how her efforts are helping people there, though she said she did get to do a virtual tour with a virtual reality headset. But she'll keep doing her part from West Fargo to help there, she said.

""I want to keep doing my water thing,"" she said. ""I want to keep helping people. That's all I know is I just want to keep helping people.""

While the pandemic continues and she can't promote her book as much as she'd like to, Anderson said she's been keeping busy making more bags and lap blankets to sell — and she hopes others know they can help in their own way, too.

""I want everybody to know that everybody can make a difference,"" she said. ""If you try and if you want to, it doesn't have to be big — it can just be small — but I just encourage everyone to try and help with that.""

352,353,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1797376/middle-east,"DUBAI: President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that COVID-19 vaccinations will begin in the coming weeks in Iran, the Middle East’s worst-hit country.

 “Foreign vaccines are a necessity until local vaccines are available,” Rouhani said in televised remarks, without giving details of what foreign vaccines would be used.

 Earlier this month Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s highest authority, banned the government from importing vaccines from the US and Britain, which he said were possibly seeking to spread the infection to other countries.

 Rouhani himself, in compliance with Khamenei’s ban, said at the time that his government would purchase “safe foreign vaccines.”

 Iran launched human trials of its first domestic vaccine candidate late last month, saying this could help it defeat the pandemic despite US sanctions that affect its ability to import vaccines.

 “There have been good movements in the field of local and foreign vaccines,” Rouhani said, adding that three domestic vaccines — Barekat, Pasteur and Razi, some of which have been developed with foreign collaboration — could begin in the spring and summer.

Cuba said earlier this month that it had signed an accord with Tehran to transfer the technology for its most advanced coronavirus vaccine candidate and carry out last-stage clinical trials of the shot in Iran.

Fronting a press conference in Wellington on Sunday afternoon, Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins and Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the woman had visited cafés, restaurants and tourist spots between Auckland and Whangārei, before reporting feeling unwell, testing positive for the virus, and going into isolation at her home.

As of 7pm Sunday night, the Ministry of Health had confirmed one of these locations; a Bendon outlet shop in Whangārei.

Hipkins said the 56-year-old woman had been isolating at Auckland’s Pullman Hotel after arriving in New Zealand from Europe on December 30, but had passed both her Covid-19 tests before leaving isolation.

 * Covid-19: Six new cases of coronavirus detected at the border



The woman started feeling mild symptoms on January 15, including muscle aches, and began feeling sicker over time. A positive Covid-19 test was returned on Saturday evening.

It is the first community case in New Zealand since November 18 last year and, although the true source of infection awaits further tests results expected on Monday, Bloomfield said officials were working on the assumption the woman caught virus in isolation and had caught one of the more virulent strains.

“We are working on the assumption this is positive case and a more transmissible variant.”

“We need people to be vigilant and get with the programme.”

It comes amid warning from experts that New Zealand needs to impose stricter measures at the border in order to keep out Covid-19 strains that a raging overseas.

Bloomfield confirmed at least 13 guests that were staying at the Pullman at the same time as the woman has tested positive for Covid-19, including some with the more virulent strain.

About 600 people that worked or stayed at the hotel at the same time as the woman are being asked to self-isolate and will be retested.

As of Sunday night, four close contacts had been identified, and were self-isolating, with all 30 places she visited being contacted, and tracing of other possible contacts underway.

However, Hipkins said the woman was travelling alone with her husband, did not attend mass events and had been taking all precautions.

He said he did not want to make any comments about the potential spread or the Government’s possible response, such as further lockdowns, until the necessary information was gathered.

“It's very early days yet,” he said.

However, extra Covid-19 testing capacity in Auckland and Northland had already been set up on Sunday, in anticipation for a surge in people seeking tests.

He reiterated what has been asked of Kiwis – including staying home if feeling unwell and getting a test.

People were asked to continue scanning in to locations through the Covid Tracer app – something the woman was doing herself.

Until 8pm on Sunday, community testing would be available at 20 Winger Crescent in Whangārei.

Information about other testing sites in Northland can be found here and here for Auckland.

On Sunday, the Ministry of Health said there were eight other new cases of Covid-19, all in managed isolation.

Two of the positive cases were from South Africa, two from the United States, one from the United Kingdom, one from the United Arab Emirates, one from Ethiopia and one from India.

On Friday, Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins announced optional saliva testing would be available for border workers in quarantine facilities from Monday.

It is the first time Covid-19 saliva testing has been offered by the Government.

This new precautionary measure is in response to higher rates of infection overseas and the more transmissible variants of Covid-19.

The saliva tests would be offered on a voluntary basis, and would not replace nasal swabs, Hipkins said.

It was hoped the saliva tests would mean any positive cases among workers at quarantine facilities would be picked up faster and workers would be provided with another layer of assurance.

The total number of active cases in New Zealand is 79. The total number of confirmed cases is 1,927.",Covid-19: Northland woman tests positive for coronavirus after leaving managed isolation,www.stuff.co.nz

356,357,https://www.castanet.net/edition/news-story-322832-4-.htm,"Health officials identified a U.K. variant of COVID-19 at a long-term care home reeling from a deadly outbreak in Barrie, Ont., Saturday as the province recorded a slightly lower daily virus case count.

The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit said genome sequencing on six COVID-19 samples from Roberta Place Retirement Lodge have been identified as the highly contagious B117 variant.

Officials with the local health unit announced earlier this week that they had found a variant at the home north of Toronto and conducted tests to determine what it was. Known variant strains of the virus were first detected in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil.

As of Saturday, officials said 32 residents of the facility have died of COVID-19.

A total of 127 residents of the site, as well as 84 staff, have tested positive. Six residents and one staff member were in hospital.

Positive cases have also been found in two of the site's essential visitors, as well as 21 household members, such as workers, and three external partners, such as physicians.

Dr. Charles Gardner, medical officer of health for the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit, said he suspected that all of the facility's cases were the variant.

An outbreak at Roberta Place was first declared on Jan. 8.

Gardner said the home wasn't able to successfully cohort cases and non-cases at the start of the outbreak, partly because of how quickly it spread and partly because of how many staff members became ill, leading to difficulty in maintaining adequate staffing.

At a virtual news conference Saturday, Gardner faced questions about why stronger protocols weren't in place at the start of the outbreak. He said it would be extremely difficult for most facilities to handle a variant that moves this quickly.

""We certainly will have to learn from this with regards to what you do with other sites. The whole province will have to learn as we go,"" he said.

The source of the variant at the facility hasn't been confirmed. Earlier this week health officials said a worker at the site had contact with someone who had travelled abroad, but Gardner said there was no violation of government quarantine guidelines in that case.

Gardner said officials are taking measures including monitoring the close contacts of those who've gone in and out of the facility to prevent community transmission.

Gardner said they haven't seen evidence of community spread yet but the risk is high.

The health unit, in partnership with the Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre, said it accelerated its immunization program on Friday and vaccinated all eligible residents and staff.

Officials said they planned to immunize residents at other retirement homes throughout Simcoe Muskoka over the weekend.

As of Jan. 16, eligible residents of all long-term care facilities in Simcoe Muskoka have also received their first dose of immunization against COVID-19.","U.K. COVID-19 variant found at long-term care home in Barrie, Ont. - Canada News",www.castanet.net

Taking advantage of tax-free capital gains is a huge deal. In the case of companies like BlackBerry (TSX:BB)(NYSE:BB) with incredible growth potential, a TFSA is definitely the right investment vehicle.

We haven’t even seen the growth yet

Expectations about outsized growth on the horizon have driven shares of BlackBerry to fresh 52-week highs of late. However, the fact remains, we haven’t seen this growth materialize yet.

Speculation is one thing, but making a well-educated prediction of future cash flows is what investing is all about. Thus, I don’t think BlackBerry is a speculative play inasmuch as this is a stock with an incredible amount of growth potential. My newfound bullishness on BlackBerry is derived from a recent partnership the company has put in place with Amazon.com.

As I wrote in a recent article, “The software BlackBerry is developing to enhance the analytics and big data needs of the future could be game-changing. The company’s Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform (IVY) provides for improved data collection from vehicle sensors. Accordingly, big data possibilities that did not exist tomorrow in improving the performance of next-generation vehicles now exist. The potential benefits of this technology are incredible, and I think BlackBerry and Amazon are positioned well to take this market by storm.”

I think BlackBerry is finally on the cusp of generating impressive growth each and every quarter. Of course, until this growth materializes, there is a degree of speculation built into this stock right now.

All that said, I think BlackBerry is on the verge of an extended parabolic move higher. There’s a lot to like about the company’s deal with Amazon, which I think could be transformational in this sector. Additionally, I think BlackBerry’s depressed valuation multiple in the past has set this stock up for tremendous stock price appreciation on the horizon.

Indeed, when one looks at where other high-growth software and technology stocks are trading at in terms of valuation, BlackBerry is dirt cheap. If you believe in BlackBerry’s growth potential as I do, this is a no-brainer for growth-oriented investors. For investors looking to capture the greatest return over time, I’d recommend this stock as a TFSA holding.

As with other high-flying technology stocks, risks do exist today. The high valuations of this sector expose investors to high levels of downside in a market correction. I’d recommend Foolish investors consider owning a highly diversified portfolio of stocks across different sectors and investing styles (i.e., sprinkle some value in with your growth).

Introducing...Coca-Cola With Coffee, which is exactly what it sounds it is.

Coca Cola will be releasing 12-oz. cans of a drink that, according to their website, ""fuses the familiar, authentic taste of Coca-Cola with the rich, luxurious flavor of 100% Brazilian coffee.""

There will be three flavors available: Dark Blend, Vanilla and Caramel.

This drink should hit shelves at the Jersey Shore by the end of January 2021...so you don't have to wait long at all!

The goal is to have these Coca Cola coffees out by January so people have a chance to try them and then hopefully, this will be your go-to coffee choice by the Summer time.

It is the perfect option. It is one of those drinks that will be ready to go...all you have to do is open and pour. Not to mention, it comes in a light, small can.

Personally....it sounds like the perfect choice to throw in your cooler to enjoy in the early morning at the beach if I do say so myself.

And according to the preliminary taste testing already done by Coca Cola, this drink is a home run.

“In preliminary consumer testing, more than 80% of consumers who tried Coca-Cola® With Coffee said they would buy it,” Kibe said. “And in presentations with several of our major retailers and grocery chains, our customers would take a sip and immediately ask, ‘When can we have this?’” “People’s taste preferences and lifestyles are changing, so we’re evolving our portfolio to meet those needs,” said Javier Meza, chief marketing officer for The Coca-Cola Company’s sparkling beverage portfolio. “As a total beverage company, we are constantly listening to consumers and looking for ways to innovate and bring people more of the beverages they want.”

So....which flavor do you want to try first?

361,362,https://www.washingtontimes.com:443/news/2019/jan/22/jack-morrissey-beauty-and-beast-producer-apologize/,"Film producer Jack Morrissey apologized Monday for a tweet envisioning the Covington Catholic High School students who were involved in a media firestorm over the weekend going into a woodchipper.

“#MAGAkids go screaming, hats first, into the woodchipper,” Mr. Morrissey, whose credits include Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” and films in the “Twilight” franchise, tweeted Monday.

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin posted a screenshot of Mr. Morrissey’s now-deleted tweet to her more than 1.5 million followers upon the news that a video allegedly showing Catholic students from Kentucky taunting a Native American man had been wildly misrepresented.

Mr. Morrissey, who has since set his Twitter account to private, told The Wrap that he now finds his comments “profoundly stupid.”

“It was something that I did not give any thought to,” he said. “It was just a fast, profoundly stupid tweet. … I would throw my phone into the ocean before doing that again.”

An edited video that went mega-viral over the weekend showed several white male students from the Covington school, many of whom were wearing “Make America Great Again” hats, during an encounter with a Native American elder at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. Hours of footage that later surfaced debunked the media narrative that the students were mocking the man, and a slew of retractions and apologies by media members and celebrities soon followed.

Mr. Morrissey said he deleted the tweet as soon as he started to notice the backlash and posted an apology that can now only be viewed by his mutual followers.

“Yesterday I tweeted an image based on FARGO that was meant to be satirical — as always — but I see now that it was in bad taste,” he wrote, according to The Wrap. “I offended many people — My sincerest apologies. I would never sincerely suggest violence against others, especially kids. Lesson learned.”

362,363,https://nationalinterest.org/blog/techland/amazon-open-pop-coronavirus-vaccine-clinic-177002,"Amazon has announced that it will open a pop-up clinic in its Seattle headquarters on Sunday to administer coronavirus vaccines.

The goal of the one-day clinic will be to inoculate two thousand eligible members of the general public. Currently, the state of Washington allows people aged sixty-five and older, as well as those fifty and older who live in a multigenerational household, to receive the vaccine.

“The truth is, COVID-19 has been a tragedy for the country, for the world, and for Washington,” Jay Carney, Amazon’s senior vice president of global corporate affairs, said during a news conference along with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, adding that the e-commerce giant will be working closely with the state’s Vaccine Command and Coordination Center.

“We’re eager to help save lives here in our home state, to rebuild the economy with you, and turn the page on COVID as quickly as we can.”

Carney added that the company will provide the space to administer the vaccines as well as assisting with any logistical matters. The clinic itself will be run in partnership with the Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle.

The launching of the pop-up clinic comes a day after Amazon had offered to help President Joe Biden and his administration in their effort to speed up the much-criticized national vaccine rollout and distribution.

“As you begin your work leading the country out of the COVID-19 crisis, Amazon stands ready to assist you in reaching your goal of vaccinating 100 million Americans in the first 100 days of your administration,” Amazon executive Dave Clark, CEO of the company’s worldwide consumer business, wrote in a letter.

The company also appealed to the new president and officials for its frontline workers to get priority access to the coronavirus vaccine, emphasizing the fact that its employees have played a major role in helping consumers get necessary products delivered safely to their homes during the yearlong pandemic.

“As the nation’s second largest employer, Amazon has over 800,000 employees in the United States, most of whom are essential workers who cannot work from home. We are proud of the role our employees have played to help customers stay safe and received important products and services at home, which is critical for people with underlying medical conditions and those susceptible to complications from COVID-19,” Clark wrote.

The vaccine push comes as worker safety at Amazon for months has been under intense scrutiny. In October, Amazon revealed in a blog post that nearly twenty thousand of its workers, or 1.44 percent of the total, in the United States contracted the virus. There have been at least ten confirmed Amazon worker deaths due to the coronavirus.

Carney asserted that Amazon is fully prepared to begin administering vaccines to its frontline workers once doses are available. He added that the company has focused on ramping up coronavirus testing at its warehouses—having run “over a million tests” at six hundred fifty sites across the country.

363,364,https://www.forbes.com/sites/garystoller/2021/01/23/bust-for-fake-id-triggers-idea-for-lower-manhattan-brewery/,"Getting busted with fake IDs opened the way for the opening of Manhattan's only production brewery.

Joe Correia and John Dantzler had their fake credentials confiscated at an East Village bar about 15 years ago, so the teenagers decided to make their own beer. The result: the founding of the Torch & Crown Brewing Company, release of their first beer Almost Famous two years ago and the opening of a brewery and restaurant in Lower Manhattan three months ago.

""Torch & Crown Brewing Company exists to embody the ambition, vibrancy, diversity and progress that defines New York City,"" says Correia, who grew up outside Manhattan in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, and, besides cofounder, is the head brewer. ""We are here to bring New York City closer to beer than it’s ever been before.""

The brewery's portfolio ""is focused on creativity, quality, and progress,"" Correia says. ""We can always be a little better — much like the city itself. We want our beers to be well-balanced and finish dry enough to warrant having more than one. A lot of today's craft beer has moved to extremes — more hops, more of a flavor or an ingredient. We really appreciate the brewers who can bring nuance back into the conversation.""

Almost Famous pokes fun at Correia and Dantzler, the brewery's CEO.

""It took us a long time to get there,"" Correia quips. “The beer has become our flagship IPA and overall best seller. It's a New England-style IPA that we ferment a little drier for a more refreshing finish. It has a deep straw color and a hazy, bright appearance. We use citra, mosaic, and Chinook hops to create a bright, tropical fruit flavor profile that is well-balanced and not overly bitter. We use a German pilsner malt base, a bunch of wheat and oats and a small percentage of speciality malts to round it out.""

Torch & Crown has produced more than 50 other beers since it released Almost Famous. Besides that IPA, some other beers currently available are Tenement Pils, a 4.9% ABV pilsner; Verve, a 6.4% ABV fruited sour; King Elizabeth, an 11.4% barleywine, and There Goes The Neighborhood, an 11.5% bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout.

Correia and Dantzler spent two years searching for an appropriate site for their brewery before finally choosing their quarters on Vandam Street on Manhattan's west side.

""We looked at over 250 different places, sent 79 letters of intent and had three leases close to the finish line that fell apart for various reasons,"" Dantzler recalls. ""I can confidently say I’ve been in most basements in Lower Manhattan, but the Vandam location was perfect for what we wanted.""

Breweries are factories that have ""a lot of engineering constraints,"" he says. ""Electrical, gas and water service must be sufficient to power our equipment, and the building must be structurally capable of holding tanks that are 10,000 pounds when full. The Vandam location was a former manufacturing plant that had the engineering capabilities to handle our use. It also had so many other amazing features like arched 30-foot-high ceilings and a 3,000-square-foot outdoor space that we knew we could use to create an incredibly unique experience for our guests.""

The brewery and restaurant were originally scheduled to open last spring, but the pandemic caused construction delays.

""Once we were finally able to complete construction and get ready to open, any sort of opening bash or large launch event wasn’t feasible,"" Dantzler says. ""So we’ve tried to create that same first-time excitement with an enhanced level of hospitality from our team members.""

Indoor and outdoor dining began in late October, but, because of the pandemic, dining is now only in a heated tent or elsewhere outdoors. The brewery also has an ""instant delivery"" service to Lower Manhattan and same-day delivery throughout the city.

The Torch & Crown website sums up the influence of New York City on Correia and Dantzler.

""We all came to New York City for its undefinable energy, its unity of ambition, its diversity, creativity and that edge you can't find anywhere else in the world,” the website says. “It drives us forward.""",Bust For Fake ID Triggers Idea For Lower Manhattan Brewery,www.forbes.com
364,365,https://cleantechnica.com/2021/01/23/straight-line-acceleration-is-not-enough-for-bmw/,"A recent BMW press release took a bit of a jab at Tesla while showing off the effort it is putting into the upcoming i4.

“The BMW i4 conveys the feeling of being light and agile yet also solid and authoritative,” says project manager David Alfredo Ferrufino Camacho. “With its superior directional reliability and high level of cornering stability, it seems to literally attach itself to the road. All electric vehicles are capable of fast straight-line acceleration. But that’s not enough for us at BMW.”

What’s obvious is that they’re taking a jab at Tesla, as Teslas are known for having great straight-line acceleration while BMW’s current gas-powered offerings outperform Teslas in the turns. What’s less obvious is that they’re following a common cultural theme between Europe and the United States.

My article from last month about the Shelby Cobra, and its new electric variant, illustrates this pretty well. The idea of powerful American cars that excel in acceleration but fall behind smaller European cars when the road gets curvy is practically ancient. One of the things that made the Cobra a hit was its European lightness combined with Ford V8 power, and now BMW is trying to do the same thing.

From what I’ve read elsewhere, the BMW i4 will come with an 80 kWh battery pack, which shouldn’t make it lighter than a Tesla Model 3, though. BMW says that it will have 530 HP and accelerate from 0-62 MPH in about four seconds, so it will still have quite a bit of straight-line acceleration capability, comparable to most Model 3s.

To get more agility, they have to be taking a different approach elsewhere. An included video explains this some:

David Ferrufino, the project lead for the BMW i4, takes the vehicle out on the track for a final calibration drive and to show off its capabilities. “The handling of the new BMW i4 is laser-sharp due to three key factors: steering support, damping, and return to center of the steering wheel.”

He then goes on to push the vehicle through various test courses, including ones for handling, bumps, and other challenges. He shows that the vehicle isn’t trying to strike a balance between comfort and handling, but aims to achieve both.

Details are a little light, though. The company used a lot of flowery language to describe both its goals and the results, but it doesn’t explain in great detail how it accomplished better handing than Tesla. Details that I was able to pick out from the marketing fluff were “the car’s long wheelbase, wide track widths, model-specific camber values, large wheels, as well as the high torsional rigidity and the vehicle’s low centre of gravity and weight balance,” “sophisticated suspension technology,” and “design and tuning of the suspension and damping systems consistently ensure optimum road contact.”

In short, BMW wants us to know that it has a better suspension setup compared to other EVs that likely weigh in about the same at the curb. While light on specifics, the basic idea is that BMW put in a lot of work when designing the suspension, steering, and brakes, and then a lot more work testing and improving the suspension.

The company likely did achieve better handling than a comparable Tesla Model 3. This doesn’t say anything bad about Tesla, except that they’re less experienced with optimizing a vehicle for handling than BMW is. BMW haas been building cars since 1923 (with a break during and after World War II), and has focused harder on performance since 1978 with its M series vehicles. Tesla is pretty new to the industry, so nobody at Tesla should feel bad if BMW outperforms them.

On the other hand, the proof is in the pudding, and nobody has had a taste yet except for BMW’s employees. The fact that the company only hinted at Tesla in this press release without naming it directly may mean that they aren’t sure their car will outperform a comparable Model 3.

We won’t know who has better handling until automotive journalists get to drive the i4 and compare it to the Model 3. At that point, we’ll be able to compare its handling and comfort, along with other features on tracks, mountain roads, and real-world driving situations.

While I am generally a Tesla fan, I’d like to see BMW do something better and push the nascent EV industry toward improvement.",Straight-Line Acceleration Is Not Enough For BMW,cleantechnica.com

• The mass exodus of corporate backing could affect how senators vote on Trump's impeachment trial, experts say.
• Dozens of companies have pulled funding from the GOP lawmakers who voted against Biden's certification.
• CEOs say they increasingly have no choice but to bring politics into the boardroom.

Moral convictions may not be the only reason that GOP lawmakers are turning their back on former President Donald Trump.

Lawmakers who voted against certifying Joe Biden as president may also be rethinking their stance after losing corporate funding, experts told Insider.

After Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in a desperate bid to overturn the presidential election results, which turned into a violent insurrection leaving five people dead, businesses have been quick to cut ties with Trump and the lawmakers who backed his baseless claims of election fraud.

Walmart, Amazon, and Morgan Stanley are among the companies that have cut off political funding to the 147 GOP lawmakers who voted against certifying Joe Biden as president. Hallmark went a step further, and asked Republican Senators Josh Hawley and Roger Marshall, who both voted against Biden's certification, to refund its political donations.

This mass exodus of corporate backing could have an effect on politicians' actions, experts told Insider.

""Cutting funding hits these politicians where it hurts,"" Donald Hambrick, a professor of management at Smeal College of Business, Pennsylvania State University, told Insider.

Withholding donations is ""probably the more profound of the actions that can be taken,"" he added.

The House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump on January 13. It's now up to the Senate to decide whether to convict him. If he gets the two-thirds majority required to be convicted, the Senate will then hold a vote on whether to bar him from ever holding public office again.

""I think senators are gonna be squirming,"" Hambrick said.

As more FBI reports and video footage of the riots are released, more companies will take action, making ""senators squirm all the more,"" Hambrick added. This could ultimately affect how senators vote, he said.

""These corporations could have a substantial effect on senators' votes,"" he said. ""The Senate vote could be very much not in Trump's favor.""

Trump's closest political allies are under pressure from some members of the party to continue supporting Trump and from companies and other politicians to pull away from him, Eric Schiffer, chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, told Insider.

California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, may have begun back-pedalling in his support for Trump because of the corporate response, Hambrick said.

""People are saying it's primarily because of the corporate cuts he faces and his party faces. Observers are tracing his own about-face to these corporate cuts,"" Hambrick said, citing news reports he had read.

""People have traced it to all the cuts in corporate donations, specifically to him.""

Cutting funding isn't the only action businesses can take to cut ties with Trump and his supporters.

In recent years, companies have been increasingly grouping together to write open letters, Hambrick said, but these may not have as big an influence on politicians.

""If the Business Roundtable wrote a letter, it would have some effect, but not as much as cutting political donations,"" Hambrick said.

Companies have likely cut funding to specific politicians before, Hambrick said, but ""nothing on this scale, nothing with as much fanfare or visibility.""

Businesses are also taking other actions in response to the siege, but these aren't necessarily directed at politicians, Forrest Briscoe, a professor of management at Smeal College of Business, Pennsylvania State University, explained.

Twitter, for example, purged 70,000 accounts associated with QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory, and Amazon Web Services, Apple, and Google were among the companies who cut ties with Parler, a social media site popular with Trump supporters.

Briscoe also referred to the New York Stock Exchange. Jeffrey Sprecher heads up its parent company, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Sprecher is married to Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler, an avid Trump supporter who supported his baseless claims of election fraud.

Loeffler had been among the lawmakers planning to vote against Joe Biden's certification as president, though she changed her mind after the siege. But her years of support for Trump could still cause businesses to rethink their relationship with the NYSE, Briscoe said.

As more information is released related to the siege, ""it's gonna be uglier and uglier, and employees and customers are gonna lean on these companies to do something and basically punish the Republicans who helped bring this about,"" Hambrick said.

""A lot of us are hesitant to wade into political waters,"" a CEO told Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder of Yale's Chief Executive Leadership Institute, on condition of anonymity. ""We don't want to bring politics into the boardroom or to our employees.""

""But we need to recognize that threats to the rule of law are legitimate business issues,"" they continued. ""It's totally legitimate and therefore also very important that we speak out on these issues.""

The number of companies responding to the Capitol siege will increase in the coming weeks, Briscoe said, and feeds into a longer-term trend of businesses becoming more political.

Their reasons for engaging in sociopolitical activism vary, he added.

""Sometimes, it's clearly in the interests of the firm, and sometimes it's not, it's just about values and beliefs and positions that people have as citizens or personally,"" Briscoe explained.

Often, the companies decide to take action because of demand from their employees, Briscoe explained. Over recent years, staff have become increasingly vocal about their sociopolitical stances and have lobbied their companies to take action, he said. Google employees, for example, fought against Alphabet's contract with the US government's defense department on Project Maven, a drone warfare project – and, after months of protests, the company said it wouldn't renew the contract.

But it's not just employees who may have urged companies to respond to the Capitol siege.

CEOs are under pressure to consult their boards before they take actions such as cutting or limiting corporate funding, Hambrick said. The directors may even have proposed the idea to the CEO in the first place, he added.

And here they have the backing of customers, too. Americans are overwhelmingly in favor of companies pausing funding, too, The Harris Poll found. In its survey of 1,960 Americans, nearly three in four said they support companies pulling the plug on political donations for the time being.

Ultimately, what companies and CEOs do matters, Sonnenfeld told Insider.

""The business leaders right now are the most trusted pillar – over the clergy, public officials, even media and academic,"" he said.","Senators who backed Trump's election challenge may rethink their stance on impeachment after losing corporate funding, experts say",www.businessinsider.com

RCMP Sgt. Peter DeVries says no foul play is suspected at this time and instead this appears to be a tragic accident.

He says a resident of a nearby home called police around 5 p.m. Friday about a fire in the bushes behind the Phibbs Exchange bus loop near Orwell Street.

Police found the body along with items that suggested the person had set up shelter in the area.

DeVries says the cause of the fire is under investigation but the temperature has dropped significantly in North Vancouver and the person might have been trying to warm themselves up.

He says the coroners service is working to identify the person and it is not currently known if the individual was a woman or a man.

He says it's not clear whether anyone other than the deceased person was camping there and no one else was at the scene when police arrived.

DeVries is urging everyone to do what they can to help the homeless, especially as winter weather hits Metro Vancouver.

""If you see homeless people, help them out,"" he said.

He points to a program started by a fellow North Vancouver RCMP officer, Cpl. Randy Wong, called Warming the Homeless, which delivers socks, toques, mittens and other items to people living on the streets.

When the weather gets cold, police proactively go out and find people who may be homeless and help them find shelter, DeVries added.

369,370,https://www.ibtimes.com/johnson-biden-discuss-deepening-alliance-pms-office-3129069,"Boris Johnson and Joe Biden on Saturday vowed to deepen ties and cooperate on tackling climate change in their first conversation since the US president's inauguration, the British prime minister's office said.

Johnson congratulated Biden on his inauguration and ""the two leaders looked forward to deepening the close alliance between our nations"", said the statement from Downing Street.

British newspapers reported that Johnson was the first European leader to receive a call from Biden, who earlier spoke to Canadian and Mexican counterparts.

The right-wing Sunday Telegraph reported that Johnson was the first leader outside North America to speak to Biden ""after his scheduled call was brought forward two days in what will be seen as a major boost for the special relationship between the UK and US.""

Biden on Friday spoke to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in his first call to a foreign leader.

The White House in a readout of the call said that Biden ""conveyed his intention to strengthen the special relationship between our countries and also ""noted the importance of cooperation, including through multilateral organizations, on shared challenges"".

Johnson tweeted a picture of himself in shirt-sleeves laughing as he spoke on the phone. ""Great to speak to President @JoeBiden this evening,"" he wrote.

The conversation appeared aimed at warming frosty relations after Biden in 2019 described Johnson as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Donald Trump, his predecessor as US president.

Biden has also been critical of Johnson's Brexit policy, but the Downing Street statement said the leaders ""discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries"".

Johnson said he intended to resolve current trade issues ""as soon as possible"".

Biden, who has Irish roots, had warned ahead of his election that if Brexit damaged the 1998 Good Friday Agreement he would not consent to a trade deal. That agreement ended 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.

Johnson praised Biden for swiftly reversing policy decisions made by his predecessor.

He ""warmly welcomed"" Biden's decision to put the United States back into the Paris climate accord and rejoin the World Health Organization. The prime minister also praised Biden's commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

The leaders said they hoped to meet soon and would work together on the United Nations' global climate change summit to be held in Scotland in November.

The White House said shared challenges would include ""combatting climate change, containing Covid-19, and ensuring global health security"" and that Biden intended to ""revitalize transatlantic ties, underscoring the critical role of NATO to our collective defense and shared values.""

The leaders ""re-committed to the NATO alliance"" and ""shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy"", Johnson's statement added. Trump was highly critical of the transatlantic alliance.

The leaders also agreed on the ""significant challenges facing the world during the pandemic"".

The United States has the largest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the world, while the UK has the highest number of deaths in Europe.

The leaders said the pandemic nevertheless created ""unparalleled opportunities to build back better and greener together"".

Johnson also praised Biden for joining the Covax initiative, a global pool of coronavirus vaccine doses for poorer nations.

The leaders additionally ""discussed the need for coordination on shared foreign policy priorities, including China, Iran, and Russia,"" the White House said.","Johnson, Biden Discuss 'Deepening Alliance': PM's Office",www.ibtimes.com

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) believe The Company, also known as the Sam Gor Syndicate, is responsible for up to 70% of all illegal drugs entering the country.

The 56-year-old has been compared to the Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman because of the scale of his alleged enterprise.

Australian police had reportedly been tracking Mr Tse for more than a decade before he was arrested on Friday as he was about to board a flight to Canada.

A police statement, which did not name Mr Tse, said the arrest warrant was issued in 2019, with police in the Netherlands acting on an Interpol notice.

""He was already on the most-wanted list and he was detained based on intelligence we received,"" a Dutch police spokesman of the arrest Friday.

The news agency cited UN estimates as saying the syndicate's revenue from methamphetamine sales alone could have been as high as $17bn in 2018.

The effort to arrest Mr Tse, Operation Kungur, involved about 20 agencies from continents across the globe with AFP taking the lead, according to Reuters.

This comes days after President Joe Biden signed 10 executive orders aimed at expanding vaccine production, ramping up testing and reopening schools, among other goals. His full 198-page strategy to end the pandemic was boiled down to seven key points.

""We didn't get into this mess overnight, and it is going to take months to get it turned around,"" Biden said.

He warned the country is likely to top 500,000 deaths next month. According to NBC News' statistics, the current death toll is 416,925 with 25,012,572 cases.

""But let me be equally clear: We will get through this,"" Biden continued. ""We will defeat this pandemic.""

Two vaccines, from Moderna and Pfizer, have already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use. Both require two shots spaced out weeks apart.

As of Jan. 23, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that more than 3 million people in the United States are receiving both shots of the Covid-19 vaccine.

But the vaccine will not be widely available and accessible to the general public at retail pharmacies for some time, said Biden's new CDC Director Rochelle Walensky.

During a ""Today"" show interview Thursday, Walensky said Americans should not expect the vaccine timeline that former President Donald Trump had promised. Former Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar had said last month on ""Today"" that the shots would be ready for pharmacies in February.

""We are going to, as part of our plan, put the vaccine in pharmacies. Will it be in every pharmacy in this country by that timeline? I don't think so,"" Walensky said. ""I don't think late February, we're going to have vaccine in every pharmacy in this country.""

The Albany Times-Union reported Saturday that the woman’s lawsuit alleged that the dispatcher who answered her friend’s 911 call failed to convey the gravity of the situation to responding officers, who never entered the apartment where she was held.

The assailant, Abdul Trowell, was later arrested and convicted of rape and kidnapping. He is serving a sentence of up to 15 years. The officers weren’t disciplined, according to court records.

Prosecutors say Trowell, armed with a knife, carried the woman to his apartment across from the governor’s mansion after encountering her and her friend on the street and offering to drive their car for them because they’d been drinking.

The friend, a man, called 911 and told a dispatcher he feared Trowell was “gonna try to rape her,” the newspaper reported. The dispatcher failed to classify the call as an emergency and didn’t note that it involved a weapon.

Trowell refused to let the three responding officers into the apartment, speaking with them instead in the hallway for more than an hour, the lawsuit said.

The officers told the friend the only way they could arrest Trowell is if the woman’s friend filed a complaint at a police station, the lawsuit said.

They later ordered the friend to leave, “leaving (her) alone, unconscious, and unprotected,” the lawsuit said. According to prosecutors, Trowell raped the woman minutes after the officers left.

""The United States strongly condemns the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists this weekend in cities throughout Russia,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.

Only health care workers and those 65 and older can visit vaccination sites, the county said.

San Diegans can make appointments at the supersite at Petco Park and other county locations where the shot is being given. Also, by calling the county at 2-1-1.

Appointments are required; walk-ups and drive-ups without appointments will be turned away.

“As I indicated a few weeks ago, the County anticipated expanding eligibility to individuals 65 years of age and older the week of January 25 as part of the continued focus on those at the greatest risk,” said Dr. Wilma Wooten, County public health officer. “With a number of health care providers now vaccinating in the age group, and the UC San Diego Health Super Station having a surplus of appointments, the decision was made this afternoon.

He’ll get credit for what it costs to replace it with softer barriers, but McNamara argued that after Hurricane Douglass last summer, the state refused to give him a permit to repair a damaged wall that was putting beachgoers at risk.

“I asked him for help. I pleaded with him, I asked him, ‘What can I do?’ He said nothing. I asked him if he could help me, and he said he can’t do nothing,” McNamara said on a Zoom call with DLNR officials.

“If this seawall falls down and kills one of the neighbors, or a life guard coming by on an ATV, or a tourist, am I responsible? Because that’s what you told me, I’m responsible,” he added.

“The only way to protect the beach is for the homes to be gone. You are just the tip of the sword here in a very very difficult situation,” Case said.

“What we are trying to do is not have seawalls along the area because what we are trying to do in the long run is protect the beach this is a hugely important beach for the public,” Case added.

380,381,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/portland-police-ignored-911-calls-summer,"Police sergeants in Portland, Oregon, reportedly canceled out dozens of low-priority 911 calls over the summer without contacting the callers to notify them they would not be receiving a law enforcement response.

The city’s police bureau policy requires officers to make contact with those calling 911 and explain to them that officers would not be responding if that is the case, although dozens of closeouts without a call back occurred in July and August, according to the Oregonian/Oregon Live, which filed public records requests about the matter.

Supervisors at the Bureau of Emergency Communications said they were receiving complaints about the dropped calls. Patrick Jones, the client services manager for the BOEC, wrote a memo about the complaints to Director Bob Cozzie in August.

“They are often understandably upset at the delay and become more upset when told PPB has closed their call without action or notification,” Jones told Cozzie.

On Aug. 21 and Aug. 23, dispatch records that the news organizations received indicated that 38 calls were never responded to and were closed out after being placed on hold. Jones wrote that one patrol sergeant told a supervisor at the BOEC that the Police Bureau “was far too busy to make those calls,” in reference to the requirement for officers to contact those who call 911 if they won’t be responding.

“That is certainly true, just as it is true that BOEC is far too busy to make the calls or to receive the inevitable calls from angry complaints wondering why police have not responded,” Jones told Cozzie.

It is unclear exactly what each of the calls that were dismissed were about, as there has reportedly been no full review of the closed-out requests. Capt. Tina Jones said that the Police Bureau was reminded about the callback policy after the summer’s dropped calls.

“It’s always a learning process, and sometimes, things get missed. This was an opportunity to remind everybody of the expectation at the command level,” Jones said. “The key is once it was brought to our attention, we addressed it.”

Chief Chuck Lovell sent a memo to Mayor Ted Wheeler in December that put some of the onus on staffing issues and the protests over the summer, which turned violent in Portland, a hot spot for demonstrations and riots following George Floyd's death.

Wheeler also expressed concerns after hearing about late response times to calls and requested more information on that matter in November. He told police that while he understood problems arising from staffing shortages, he was “increasingly concerned that priority calls are taking too long to receive a response and that some calls may not be responded to at all, leaving community members without adequate public safety service in Portland.”

The Washington Examiner reached out to the Portland Police Department and was directed to a Saturday news release that acknowledged that officers are supposed to contact callers if they don't respond.

""Some calls for service are determined to be informational in nature or not criminal matters,"" the statement read. ""Patrol supervisors are trained to balance the call load with available resources and in certain cases can cancel the call. There is a procedure for this, and supervisors are tasked with balancing public expectations, Bureau resources, the Bureau's mission, values, and goals, and dedication to community policing.

""A decision to cancel police response carries with it the obligation to attempt to contact those requesting police services and inform them why there will be no response,"" it added.

The response time for calls has decreased since a peak over the summer, when the city was grappling with civil unrest, and in February, more officers will be reassigned to patrol, the release noted.

""Responding when our community calls for help is our core function, and it's disheartening when we don't meet expectations,"" said Deputy Chief Chris Davis.

Savaro Ltd, the trading firm which procured the chemicals in 2013, shared a London address with companies linked to George Haswani and Imad Khoury, according to the report by documentary film-maker Firas Hatoum, which aired on Lebanon’s al-Jadeed TV station this week.

Haswani, Khoury and his brother Mudalal Khoury have all been sanctioned by Washington for supporting Assad’s war effort. All three are joint Syrian-Russian nationals, according to the U.S. sanctions list and a database that gathers data from official Russian institutions.

The U.S. Treasury accused Mudalal Khoury in 2015 of “an attempted procurement of ammonium nitrate in late 2013”. It sanctioned his brother Imad a year later for engaging in business activities with Mudalal. Haswani was sanctioned in 2015 on charges of helping Assad’s government to buy oil from Islamic State militants, which he has denied.

In reviewing filings with Companies House, the UK’s companies registry, Reuters found that Savaro and Hesco Engineering and Construction Company Ltd, a firm subject to U.S. sanctions for its links to Haswani, both moved their corporate registers -- official company records -- to the same London address on June 25, 2011.

That address was also the registered office for IK Petroleum Industrial Company Ltd, in which Imad Khoury was a director, the filings show.

Dozens of companies can share listed addresses and such links do not necessarily prove company owners are connected. But it is rare for firms to move their registers, particularly to the same address on the same day, according to a Reuters review of filings by hundreds of companies.

Reuters located the agent which had helped register Hesco, but it did not respond to attempts to seek comment about Hesco’s relationship with Savaro. Reuters could not determine if Haswani controlled Savaro, which might have provided a possible indication of his involvement in the procurement of the ammonium nitrate which exploded in Beirut.

Imad Khoury denied links to Savaro. “There is a registrar in London, many companies are registered by it, not just mine,” he told Reuters. “I don’t know this Savaro.”

Mudalal Khoury said there was “no logic” behind laying blame for the Beirut explosion on a company registered at a London address where many others are also registered.

Reuters could not reach Haswani for comment. His son told Reuters in Moscow that his father was unlikely to comment on allegations of links to the chemicals because they are “total nonsense”.

The findings about the possible links between Savaro and the Syrian businessmen have raised questions among some in Beirut over whether the ammonium nitrate, which is used for fertilizer but also explosives, may have been destined for Syria.

“We want this to be investigated,” Youssef Lahoud, a lawyer who represents around 1,400 victims of the blast, told Reuters.

“It may lead us nowhere or it may be the thread that unravels but we must follow up.”

Lebanese Justice Minister Marie Claude Najm told Reuters the report should be investigated, as with any other allegations related to the ongoing probe into the blast, which is in the hands of the investigating judge and is confidential.

The Companies House register identifies a Cypriot national, Marina Psyllou, as director and majority owner of Savaro since 2016. Psyllou told Reuters in an email on Friday that she does not manage or own Savaro. She did not respond to questions about Haswani.

The Beirut blast killed 200 people, injured thousands and destroyed entire neighbourhoods. Officials have said the chemicals went up in flames after being stored at the port in poor conditions for years.

The ammonium nitrate was loaded onto a ship called the Rhosus in Georgia, shipping records show, before making an unscheduled stop in Lebanon in late 2013. It never left, becoming tangled in a legal dispute. The Mozambican firm that ordered the nitrate, FEM, has said it ordered the shipment through Savaro Ltd.","Beirut blast chemicals possibly linked to Syrian businessmen - report, company filings",www.reuters.com

Ministers are mulling an extension of the prohibitions into the summer. The Biden administration is set to reverse Donald Trump’s loosening of restrictions from Britain and Europe. The EU, for its part, has proposed a total ban on visitors from the UK.

Lying behind these barriers is the fear that a new variant of Covid might defeat the vaccine, and so make a mockery of everything we have gone through. I have no idea whether that fear is well-founded. Is it a proportionate response to an identified mutation, or a more general anxiety that some new variant somewhere might turn out to be jab-resistant? If it’s the second – as Angela Merkel’s talk of “the precautionary principle” suggests – then it is, if you think about it, an argument for permanent restrictions. After all, there is always a theoretical possibility that a new disease might enter your country from somewhere else.

But as this column keeps lamenting, the perception of a common threat alters our brain chemistry. We don’t make the trade-offs that we would have made a year ago. We become warier, more inward-looking, readier to surrender liberty for security. When air travel finally gets going again, it may be accompanied by so many protocols, from social distancing to vaccine certificate checks, that fewer people bother – which will mean that the remaining flights become rarer and more expensive.

What would such a world be like? Sometimes, I feel the gentle tug of Roger’s reasoning. A year ago, I was spending so much time in Heathrow’s T5 that knew several of the BA staff by name. Since then, my world has become narrower, but also deeper. Never before have I appreciated the extent to which all four seasons show in this country to their sweetest perfection. With the skies empty of aircraft, I have spent hours listening to birdsong. I know my neighbours better. I have taught my young son chess.

Rootedness need not imply introversion, far from it. Roger expressed this sentiment best in his book about wine in which, after an exquisite tour of the landscapes, villages and local legends of Burgundy, he reveals that he has never set foot in the place, preferring to “travel in the glass”. Fluent in many languages, and with an unrivalled knowledge of European music, literature, history and philosophy, he felt that travel narrowed the mind.

He believed, for instance, that Spain had been invented and set to music by French composers who had spent almost no time there. “Like Debussy, I know Spain intimately, having driven my rickety old scooter over the Pyrenees for a couple of days, when I failed to reach anywhere of note. Hence, Spain is still unspoiled in my imagination. The villages and bodegas that I visit in my glass are whitewashed, flagstoned, perched on steep inclines with the parched, mean, gritty, clay-bound soil falling from their tight perimeters like terracotta skirts”.

Scheduled to open this spring, the university’s Forensic Science Research and Training Laboratory will be led by Mary Ellen O’Toole, a retired FBI special agent who previously served in the agency’s Behavioral Analysis Unit in San Francisco. O’Toole, who retired from the FBI in 2009, has been a Stafford County resident for 23 years, and serves as the director of the forensic science program at George Mason University. O’Toole has interviewed countless criminals during her career. She said some believed they could outsmart forensic science. “They may have read a book on forensics,” she said, “or they’ve watched the same programs that you and I have watched, but what they don’t understand is. When you go into a scene, and let’s say you commit a homicide, you’re shedding evidence, and it’s just a matter of us being able to find it and do something with it.” O’Toole said the science and techniques of forensics go back hundreds of years, when investigators first began collecting evidence from crime scenes. “There’s been tons of development over the years …. The science has really developed and recently, it’s really taken off,” said O’Toole. “DNA is the gold standard for forensics. That’s what you look for in every case, but obviously, we don’t find it in every case.”

O’Toole said students in today’s forensic science programs are well-versed in courses such as chemistry, biology, physics and math, and said about 85 percent of those students are women. “As they reach their junior and senior year, and certainly, if they’re a graduate student, then they start to learn how to apply that science to crime scenes,” said O’Toole.

Students enter the home to gather evidence, such as a bloody washcloth, blood splatter on a wall, or other clues. O’Toole said students learn to collect the fragile evidence in such a way to preserve it for further processing in a laboratory. “It could be DNA or fingerprints,” said O’Toole. “They learn how to use science and how to apply it to a crime scene with the goal to identify who’s responsible, eliminating anybody that didn’t commit the crime.” A 5-acre tree-lined parcel on George Mason University’s Manassas campus has been designated to serve as an outdoor laboratory. The lab will provide opportunities for students and researchers to examine environmental changes, soil composition, animal scavenging, floral diversity and insect species variations.

It’s undoubtedly a daily occurrence for celebrities, since we all do know them from somewhere. But there is apparently actually a one in 135 chance that we all have a look-alike roaming around in the world at the same time we are. And I think we’ve just found Harry Potter actress Emma Watson’s doppelgänger.

We’ve watched the 30-year-old British star grow up since her first starring role in the original Harry Potter movie back in 2001. But at the same time, 31-year-old Kari Lewis was growing up in the U.S. and getting recognized as the franchise’s Hermione Granger. Nowadays, she cosplays as the character at conventions. Check it out:

Double take much? If I passed by Kari Lewis, I would absolutely convince myself I’d just been in the presence of the Little Women actress. When she was recently interviewed by Marie Claire, Lewis talked about the first time she was recognized as Emma Watson’s doppelgänger:

I was approached by a couple of young girls at a post office and they called me Hermione. I didn't recognize the name, so I went home and looked it up. It was around the time the first Harry Potter film was released.

Now, this is just insane. It’s one thing to be the doppelgänger of a celebrity, but Emma Watson and Kari Lewis grew up at the same time and Lewis has apparently looked like the actress since she was a kid. And she's found some creative ways to capitalize on the fact that she resembles one of the world's most recognizable stars. Here she is rocking Hermione’s school uniform on her Instagram:

Kari Lewis has been dressing up as Emma Watson’s Hermione Granger since 2017, when she attended her local Comic Con in Indiana. In her main gig, she works as an instructional assistant, but she enjoys dressing up as the actress on the side, even making some money for her picture-perfect portrayal of Watson’s Disney role in The Beauty and the Beast:

Are you drifting off thinking about your doppelgänger yet? The pair definitely share a similar facial structure, and she absolutely nailed Emma Watson’s iconic eyebrows. It’s so interesting how genes from completely different families can align so perfectly.

And Emma Watson is in serious luck with her doppelgänger playing tribute to her work, instead of I don’t know, framing her for murder or something? Can we also put it out in the universe for Kari Lewis and Emma Watson to meet someday?

392,393,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1797366/middle-east,"CAIRO: Tribal clashes in Sudan’s Darfur region have killed at least 250 people and displaced more than 100,000 people since erupting earlier this month, the UN refugee agency said.

 The violence in the provinces of West Darfur and South Darfur has posed a significant challenge to the country’s transitional government.

 Among those displaced were some 3,500 people, mostly women and children, who fled into neighboring Chad, according to Boris Cheshirkov, a spokesman for the UNHCR said on Friday.

 Those fleeing the violence into eastern Chad’s Ouaddai province have been overwhelmingly forced to seek shelter — often nothing more than a tree — in remote places that lack basic services or public infrastructure, the spokesman added.

 The fighting in West Darfur between members of the Arab Rizeigat tribe and the non-Arab Massalit tribe grew out of a fistfight Jan. 15 in a camp for displaced people in Genena, the provincial capital.

 Four days later, the clashes in South Darfur erupted between Rizeigat and the non-Arab Falata tribe over the killing of a shepherd.

 The violence has been a major test for the Sudanese government’s ability to protect civilians in the war-torn region following the end of the joint UN-African Union peacekeeping force’s mandate in Darfur this month.

The National Party says the Australian government's push to make Google share royalties with news publishers is too heavy-handed.

Australia is introducing a landmark law to make Google, Facebook and potentially other tech companies pay media outlets for their news content.

But Google has hit back saying it could withdraw the search engine from Australia.

Google's stance prompted Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison to say the country would not respond to threats.

 * Google threats to Australia shouldn't make our government wary - expert

 * Google says Australian law to make digital platforms pay for news is unworkable

 * Trump administration concerned about Australia's tech giant crackdown



National's spokesperson for digital economy and communications Melissa Lee said the Australian model is far too heavy-handed and has chilling connotations as to how other future technological innovations could be affected for the market here.

“We've said before the election we are committed to a wide-ranging review of the media sector in New Zealand which includes content regulation, funding and capacity across all platforms and would not support such a content policy as proposed in Australia without this first taking place.”

Lee said the media sector innovates and changes and any new law needs to be fair and have buy-in from stakeholders.

Auckland University of Technology computer science professor Dave Parry told RNZ that Google might well follow through with the threats, because barring Australians won't affect their bottom line too much.

Parry said Google uses a “parasitic” business model where they make money off other people's content.

“If they are seen as being under threat by having to pay for some of that content which they don't usually, then I can see [Google] wanting to make an example out of Australia on this.”

The potential ban would put a “mark in the ground” over with how far Google was willing to go to defend its business interests, and the New Zealand Government should take note if it planned to introduce similar laws to Australia's, he said.

He added that New Zealand websites may benefit if the search engine was pulled, as Australian users would flock to Aotearoa's version of Google.

Johnson congratulated Biden on his inauguration and ""the two leaders looked forward to deepening the close alliance between our nations"", said the statement from Downing Street.

The call came after Biden on Friday spoke to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in his first call to a foreign leader.

Johnson tweeted a picture of himself in shirt-sleeves laughing as he spoke on the phone. ""Great to speak to President @JoeBiden this evening,"" he wrote.

The conversation appeared aimed at warming frosty relations after Biden in 2019 described Johnson as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Donald Trump, his predecessor as US president.

Biden has also been critical of Johnson's Brexit policy, but the Downing Street statement said the leaders ""discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries"".

Johnson said he intended to resolve current trade issues ""as soon as possible"".

Biden, who has Irish roots, had warned ahead of his election that if Brexit damaged the 1998 Good Friday Agreement he would not consent to a trade deal. That agreement ended 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.

Johnson praised Biden for swiftly reversing policy decisions made by his predecessor.

He ""warmly welcomed"" Biden's decision to put the United States back into the Paris climate accord and rejoin the World Health Organization. The prime minister also praised Biden's commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

The leaders said they hoped to meet soon and would work together on the United Nations' global climate change summit to be held in Scotland in November, said the statement.

The leaders ""re-committed to the NATO alliance"" and ""shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy"", it added. Trump was highly critical of the transatlantic alliance.

The leaders also agreed on the ""significant challenges facing the world during the pandemic"".

The United States has the largest number of cases and deaths in the world, while the UK has the highest number of deaths in Europe.

Under lockdown rules, Brits are allowed outside to go for a walk with one other person, but Downing Street also launched encouraged people to ""look in the eyes"" of medics amid calls for ""tougher restrictions.""

Calls for a harsher lockdown came after an Oxford University study claimed England's third nationwide lockdown is having ""a third less impact on movement"" than the first one last March.

The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies said on Friday the R rate in England is now between 0.8 and 1, down from last week when it was between 1.2 and 1.3, which shows lockdown is slowly bringing down the rate of infection.

Despite this, figures show one million people in England became infected in the week leading up to Friday 22 alone.

England is also facing two new coronavirus variants, which Boris Johnson said on Friday could be associated with a ""higher degree of mortality.""

Sir Patrick Vallance said early evidence suggested the new UK variant could increase mortality by almost a third in men in their 60s.

The Government already knew the variant was up to 70% more transmissible but had previously suggested it was no more deadly than the original coronavirus.

The Government and the police force have tried to take a tougher stand on people flouting lockdown, but authority figures have been met with resistance.

Joyce Blessing was suddenly interrupted by fellow gospel musician Cecelia Marfo during her performance. She snatched her microphone and started prophesying that God said Joyce Blessing should go back to her marriage.

The embarrassing moment which was captured on camera has social media talking, and brother Sammy, who has also had similar embarrassing encounter Cecelia Marfo, has something to say.

In a Facebook live video, Brother Sammy claimed once went mad and delivered. He also claimed that Cecelia Marfo is possessed by ‘maame water’ (mermaid) and that she is doing this to disgrace the gospel fraternity.

“Cecelia Marfo has ‘maame water’ spirit and mistaken it for the holy spirit,” he said in a video he shared on his Facebook page today. “She uses spirits from the sea to work so she can be possessed at any time. She sings for the devil. She wants to disgrace the gospel fraternity.”

He continued: “What she did to Joyce Blessing isn't from God; that not how God delivers. She also spoke fake tongues. She has never called Joyce Blessing since her divorce.”

403,404,https://www.pressherald.com/2021/01/23/political-tensions-alter-strategies-in-abortion-debate/,"Anti-abortion leaders across America were elated a year ago when Donald Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to appear in person at their highest-profile annual event, the March for Life held every January.

The mood is more sober now – a mix of disappointment over Trump’s defeat and hope that his legacy of judicial appointments will lead to future court victories limiting abortion rights.

Organizers of this year’s March for Life in Washington, scheduled for Friday, have asked their far-flung supporters to stay home, due to political tensions in the city and the coronavirus pandemic. They plan instead to livestream the activities of a few invited participants, a sharp contrast to the tens of thousands of people who usually attend.

Meanwhile, Trump, whose administration took numerous steps to curtail abortion access, has been replaced as president by Joe Biden, a staunch supporter of abortion rights. Biden’s fellow Democrats now control both chambers of Congress, thanks to victories in two Senate runoff elections in Georgia where anti-abortion groups campaigned vigorously for the Republican candidates who lost.

On Friday, the 48th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris said they would seek to enshrine that right into federal law to protect it from court challenges.

“In the past four years, reproductive health, including the right to choose, has been under relentless and extreme attack.” their statement said. “We are deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care – including reproductive health care.”

The president of the March for Life, Jeanne Mancini, said she and her allies worry the Biden administration will pursue “radical pro-abortion extremism.” At the same time, anti-abortion activists are buoyed by Trump’s appointment of scores of federal judges – including three Supreme Court justices – who are viewed as open to repealing or weakening Roe v. Wade.

In Republican-governed states, scores of tough anti-abortion bills have been enacted in recent years, and more are surfacing this year from GOP lawmakers eager to see if any of these measures might reach the Supreme Court as a challenge to Roe v. Wade.

“I am very optimistic.” said Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee. “We’ll see a lot of new pro-life bills … and we are going to see judges who are open to them.”

In Arkansas, a new bill would criminalize abortions except to save a pregnant woman’s life. The measure declares: “It is time for the United States Supreme Court to redress and correct the grave injustice and the crime against humanity which is being perpetuated by its decisions in Roe v. Wade” and other cases.

The Texas legislature also will consider several sweeping abortion bans. In Montana, anti-abortion bills are expected to advance now that Republican Greg Gianforte has replaced Democrat Steve Bullock as governor. Bullock supported abortion rights during eight years in office.

South Carolina lawmakers are considering a bill that would ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually around six weeks after conception. Similar bills have passed in several other states, but courts have blocked their implementation.

Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state government issues for the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, says anti-abortion legislation may get top priority even in states where lawmakers confront multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and severe budgetary woes.

Referring to anti-abortion lawmakers, Nash said, “They see the Supreme Court as being in their corner, and it’s their job to continue to pass restrictions and bans.”

Among abortion-rights activists, there’s relief and optimism as the Biden administration takes power Biden is expected to soon issue executive orders reversing anti-abortion actions taken by Trump.

One such order would rescind the so-called “global gag rule” that prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance for abortion-related services. Another order would rescind what abortion-rights supporters called the “domestic gag rule,” barring Title X family planning funds from going to any health care providers who perform abortions or make referrals for them. The ban prompted Planned Parenthood, the leading abortion provider in the U.S., to quit the program rather than comply.

Abortion-rights supporters also hope that Congress, under Democratic control, will repeal the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for abortions unless a woman’s life is in danger or in cases of rape or incest.

Biden, a longtime supporter of the amendment, reversed himself in 2019 and now favors its repeal. But prospects for repeal are uncertain, given that Democrats would need some Republican votes in the Senate to overcome a potential filibuster.

However, the Democrats’ narrow Senate majority is expected to be sufficient to confirm Biden’s nomination of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra – a strong supporter of abortion rights — to head the Department of Health and Human Services.

Major anti-abortion groups invested large sums and mobilized hundreds of volunteers to back the losing GOP Senate candidates in Georgia, hoping to retain Republican control so Becerra could be rejected.

Becerra and Biden are Roman Catholic, and the new administration’s support for abortion rights poses a dilemma for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Its president, Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez, congratulated Biden on his inauguration Wednesday, yet warned that his policies on abortion and contraception “advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity.”

Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood, said the worries that plagued her throughout 2020 gave way to joy with the Democrats’ Senate victories in Georgia.

“I was actually able to breathe in hope and possibility,” she said. “But we recognize the fact that the fight is ongoing — the courts and many of our state legislatures are going to be very difficult for us.”

While not enough data exists yet to show whether abortions have increased or decreased during the pandemic, there’s some evidence that more women induced their own abortions, using abortion pills they were able to purchase or receive by mail from a foreign source. It’s become increasingly easy for women to circumvent the U.S. law requiring the pill to be dispensed by a health care professional.

Abigail Aiken, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas, said the online abortion pill provider Aid Access received a surge of requests early in the pandemic, when some states cited the outbreak as a reason to limit abortion access at clinics.

Requests nearly doubled in Texas, which had the most severe pandemic-related restrictions on clinics, said Aiken, whose research was published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology.

Elisa Wells, co-director of another online organization called Plan C, estimates that tens of thousands of American women annually are now seeking abortion pills for self-managed abortions – based on the number of clicks on Plan C’s website that lists overseas pharmacies offering to ship the pills.",Political tensions alter strategies in abortion debate,www.pressherald.com

Wade, affirmed that the constitutional right to privacy included the right to abortion. Yet, nearly half a century later, abortion is a right in name only for many across the country.

As a result of hundreds of restrictive state laws enacted in the last decade; mandatory waiting periods, targeted facilities requirements, funding restrictions, and more, today, access to abortion largely depends on someone’s income, race, and ZIP code.

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the crisis of abortion access, including in states like Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and Ohio, where anti-abortion Governors used the crisis to temporarily ban abortion.

According to a new study, in Texas, the ban’s impact was to force people to delay their care or cross state lines to access it. In the midst of an unprecedented public health crisis, forcing patients to travel long distances and delay care is unconscionable. For some people, an abortion delayed is an abortion denied.

As we commemorate Roe’s 48th anniversary, we must acknowledge that the legal right to abortion isn’t enough.

It’s not only state legislatures that have damaged access. In its four years, the Trump administration enacted a number of anti-abortion policies, including a new Title X gag rule, that forces providers to withhold information from patients about their pregnancy options as a condition of receiving public health funding for family planning.

The gag rule forced Planned Parenthood out of the decades old program, and it has dramatically reduced access to basic reproductive care; including birth control and cancer screenings; for low income people, people of color, and people living in rural communities.

The Trump administration’s appointment of three Supreme Court justices solidified a 6-3 majority hostile to reproductive rights on the court, putting Roe v. Wade itself under dire threat. Ominously, one of the first actions taken by this new court was to limit access to medication abortion during a public health crisis.

At Planned Parenthood, we believe that patients and providers – not politicians – should make personal medical decisions. Planned Parenthood’s health centers are a key part of the public health system, offering access to a wide range of care, including wellness exams, birth control, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, gender-affirming care, and abortion.

We believe that a patient’s health and well-being should drive important health decisions – not where they live, what they look like, or how much money they make.

The American people agree that we need more access to health care, not less. Support for safe, legal abortion is at record levels. 77 percent of Americans do not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned, and a majority say that states are making it too difficult for patients to access abortion. We need to stop the attacks and start expanding access to quality, affordable reproductive health care, including abortion.

Now is the time to undo the damage done by state legislatures and the Trump administration.

Fortunately, the Biden administration has the opportunity to begin taking steps to build a healthier, more equitable future for reproductive health. The new administration must demonstrate their support for comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care and swiftly put an end to harmful policies. We must put an end to restrictions on abortion coverage, unnecessary regulations on medication abortion, and launch proactive steps to protect and expand access to care so that reproductive freedom is a reality for every person.",Jenna Tosh: Marking 48th anniversary of Roe v.

The pay-TV giant is urging the regulator to take tougher action on the corporation, claiming it was “gaming the system” through “intragroup” deals by allowing BBC Studios and its public ­service arm to remain too close.

Sky, owned by the American cable operator Comcast, pointed to the executives sitting on both its main board and commercial boards as an example of “cross contamination” and raised concerns about the “unfair competitive advantage” handed to BritBox, the subscription, streaming platform co-funded by the BBC and ITV.

It warned the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom that a lack of separation could cause market distortion that would leave the BBC in breach of its Royal Charter.

Sky said: “The lack of separation between BBC Studios and the Public Service, combined with the lack of transparency around how these two entities interact, demonstrate the inadequacy of the current framework and Ofcom’s ability to hold the BBC to account. As a result, the BBC has been able to game the system and enter into intragroup arrangements which risk distorting the market in breach of the BBC’s regulatory obligations, to the ultimate detriment of end consumers.”

“He is using the words of the center, talking about unity, but he is governing like someone from the far left,” Rubio said in the early morning Tweet.

“Number one, he has issued more executive fiats (orders) than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump,"" the senator continued.

Some of President Biden’s directives have been direct reversals of former President Trump’s orders, such as cancelling the Keystone XL Pipeline project, ending construction of the southern border wall, ending the travel ban from several majority Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris Climate Accord.

NBC 6 political analyst Carlos Curbelo noted that ""executive orders are clearly temporary. We're seeing President Biden cancel a lot of the orders from the previous administration, and certainly Mr. Trump did that when he came into office.""

""There is a good debate to be had about whether or not this is the best way of making policy,"" Curbelo added.

The orders Biden issued on Friday include expansions to food assistance programs, adjustments to worker safety policies and a push to increase federal workers' minimum wage to $15/hour.

“Families are going hungry, people are at risk of being evicted,"" the President said on Friday before signing the orders. ""Job losses are mounting again, and we need to act.""

On Twitter, Rubio insisted the President is governing outside of political norms.

407,408,https://www.lmtonline.com/entertainment/article/Larry-King-Appreciation-Hard-Working-Host-Helped-15893276.php,"Click here to read the full article.

Larry King, the broadcast legend who died Saturday at the age of 87, deserves more credit than he typically gets for helping to build CNN and realize Ted Turner’s audacious vision for a 24-hour global news network.

In his prime, King’s “Larry King Live” interviews regularly made headlines thanks to his unique questioning style, which could be remarkably incisive about the subject at hand as well as, occasionally, cringe-worthy misinformed. As CNN gained prominence in the late 1980s and ’90s, King’s show became one of the hottest stops on the TV circuit for newsmakers, political leaders, captains of industry, crusading activists and celebrities, ranging from Barbra Streisand and Liza Minnelli to Donald Trump and Oprah Winfrey to Suzanne Somers and Barbara Eden.

The variety of King’s guests and the fact that it went out live every night at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT gave the show extra sizzle. The inclusion of call-in questions from viewers was a nod to King’s earlier radio days as a talk jock. The host took cues about what the general public wanted to know from the tenor of his listeners’ queries.

In a sign of how much the media universe has changed, it’s unimaginable in the age of social media that major stars, ex-presidents, U.S. senators and myriad celebrities would go live for an hour on TV with an interviewer who proudly didn’t like to prepare. King’s show sought to be the Instagram of its time, a hub of news and dish on the story that everyone in the country was talking about on any given day.

Naturally, King had good instincts for compelling stories. He was capable of coaxing his guests to explain the human dimensions of scandals, political battles or issue advocacy campaigns. He made stars of crusading, camera-hunting lawyers like Mark Geragos, Johnnie Cochran and Alan Dershowitz.

King first became famous in Miami but never lost his Brooklyn touches. He had a baritone voice that was made for AM radio and a presence on TV that commanded attention. He showed genuine exuberance for his work and curiosity about the people, causes and controversies that came before his old-school signature microphone. As CNN’s international reach expanded in the 1990s, King’s show served as a beacon of American culture for the world.

“Larry King Live” mostly originated from CNN’s studios in Hollywood. That made King perfectly positioned to zero-in on the O.J. Simpson murder drama from day one, following the brutal stabbing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman in June 1994.

Family members of the Browns and the Goldmans and all manner of lawyers, witnesses and hangers-on connected to the case were regulars during the legal storm that engulfed O.J. Simpson in the mid-1990s. Simpson famously surprised King by calling in to his show (when his lawyer Cochran was the guest) the day after Simpson was acquitted of the murders in October 1995.

King was frequently criticized for softball questions and an overly friendly style. When Simpson called in, King mostly let him rant for about three minutes about the deficiencies of the prosecution’s case.

King made no apologies for his style when I sat down with him in 2013 in Miami. He was there for the annual NATPE programming convention to push international sales of his post-CNN interview show “Larry King Now.” King’s final series aired on the Ora TV digital platform funded by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim.

King was proud of being an equity partner in the company. And while his reach may have been smaller than CNN, King’s legacy was strong enough to command such guests as Winfrey, Tony Hawk, Bob Woodward, Bill Maher, Ryan Seacrest, John Cena and many other boldface names.

In 2013, it was clear from his quips and cracks that King was still more than a little unhappy to have been ushered out of CNN after 25 years.

“I don’t answer to suits anymore,” he said with a grin. He was also clear that he didn’t feel the need to reinvent his approach to TV.

“I’m still doing what I did 55 years ago, asking questions of people,” King said.

He was serving his sentence at he Federal Corrections Institute in Sheridan until his release.

A press release from the White House noted that Harder “fully accepted responsibility, pled guilty, and cooperated with the government’s civil and criminal actions against him at great personal cost. ... President Trump commends Mr. Harder for choosing to put his employees, investors, and the senior citizens residing in Sunwest’s homes above himself.”

Harder served as president and CEO of Sunwest from 1992 to 2008.

The company bought Hillside in 2003. The McMinnville retirement center was in receivership at the time, because of an overly ambitious and expensive expansion plan, so Sunwest was viewed as a rescuer.

Around the same time, Sunwest began purchasing other properties in Yamhill County, its local holdings ultimately coming to include the Osprey Point Assisted Living Community, Osprey Memory Court and Osprey Pointe Cottages in McMinnville, the Chehalem Springs Retirement Community in Newberg, and the Deer Meadow Assisted Living Facility in Sheridan.

But just a year later, Sunwest’s former chief financial officer filed a federal lawsuit accusing Harder and key associates of racketeering, fraud and theft. Federal officials began investigating, and weary Hillside residents knew they were in for another wild ride.

Sunwest officials continued to promise residents the situation was under control. But the company’s financial problems forced staff layoffs, made it difficult to attract new residents and fueled anxiety among existing residents.

In 2008, Sunwest put 132 of its 275 centers up for sale, including Osprey Pointe. In 2009, Harder resigned and the company went into bankruptcy.",Former Sunwest CEO's sentence commuted,newsregister.com

Finding study opportunities for Namibians in the institutions of higher learning and the promotion of student exchange programs in the countries of accreditation remain high on the agenda.

At independence 21 March 1990, Namibia adopted a constitution, the supreme law of the land which entrenches multiparty democracy as well as fundamental rights and freedoms. The constitution guarantees the citizens the right of expression and the freedom of association. Since independence, Namibia has maintained an environment conducive to a free press. Namibia also remains committed to a free market economic system and recognizes the role of the private sector in the development process.

Namibia is truly one of the most politically stable countries in Africa, where peace and tranquillity is real and the footprint of democracy is visible. In this regard, Namibia has maintained the institution of Presidential, National Assembly, regional and local elections every five years.

Indeed, the Government and people of Namibia are committed to democracy and respect the rule of law. While Namibia has a rich ethnic diversity, today its people are united as one, thanks to the Government’s policy of national reconciliation.

On the tourism front, you are invited to go and experience the fantastic diversity of plant and animal life as well as the strikingly different climate and landforms found in Namibia. Whatever your destination, no two days will be the same. Each region of the country has something different to offer, inspired by the elements, the surroundings and natural materials. Visit Namibia and experience all the country’s natural wonders and resources. Namibia’s breath-taking landscapes and clean environment make it an attractive place to visit.

Namibia has an abundance of natural resources, among them, a wide range of mineral deposits including world class diamonds and uranium, copper, lead, zinc, gold, semi-precious stones, industrial minerals, salt and fluorspar. Namibia has rich fishing grounds, with both demersal and pelagic species, which place the country among the top 10 nations in the international fishing sector.

Namibia’s agricultural sector is also imperative to the country’s economy with a thriving red meat industry and the cultivation of crops such as maize, wheat, pearl millet, groundnuts, beans and cotton.

On the market side, Namibia has preferential trade access to the 190 million inhabitants of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) as one of the 14 member states.

Namibia also belongs to the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) affording duty and quota free access to the South African market and others. Namibia is a signatory to the Cotonou Agreement, giving the country duty free access to the European Union for a wide range of manufactured and agricultural products. Namibia also has duty and quota free access to the lucrative US market under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). To those investing in Namibia, we offer among the most attractive fiscal incentives in Africa via the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) regime. The country offers an advantageous legislative and fiscal environment and a government keen to foster the engines of economic growth and prosperity.

414,415,https://www.kpcw.org/post/lt-governor-henderson-says-utah-push-more-vaccine-doses-biden-administration,"The Utah Department of Health says over 222,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered as of Saturday, but state officials will be making their case to the new Biden Administration for more doses in Utah. KPCW’s Sean Higgins spoke with Utah Lt. Governor Deidre Henderson and has this:

With nearly a quarter-million doses of COVID-19 vaccine reported to be administered statewide, Utah officials will be making a case to the federal government for more vaccines to be shipped to the state.

Utah Lieutenant Governor Deidre Henderson was at the Summit County vaccination center in Park City on Friday to speak with county health department officials about their needs and what the state can do to help. She says the problem with the vaccine rollout right now is there simply are not enough doses available on a weekly basis.

“The bottleneck is the manufacturers, right?” Henderson says. “We have to get enough manufactured and then we have to plead our case with our federal partners to get our doses each week. Right now, we’re getting about 33,000 doses every week and if we can show that we’re exhausting those doses within a few days of getting them, then we’ll be better positioned to ask for more. They’re also giving people doses based on the age of their population.”

Summit County Health Director Rich Bullough says the county usually receives between 300-500 doses per week, but the county’s demand far outweighs the supply. He says the issue is the large number of workers in the county that don’t have resident status.

The number of vaccines distributed by the state each week takes into account census population. Many of the county’s workers and part-time residents are not factored into those numbers, but Bullough says the process is constantly changing.

“The first sort is by population -- census population -- which is not representative of who we have here and so that’s been part of our issue,” says Bullough. “We’ve actually, fully a third of our vaccines so far have been non-residents, but they’ve been people who work here and they’re not people we want to turn away, so we have instantly a shortfall. And then, the process of the actual request is a partnership with health officers where we, pretty much on a daily basis with the vaccine person at the state, Rich Lakin, talk about availability, distribution, who can move vaccines, so it ebbs and flows.”

Governor Spencer Cox mandated earlier this month that all vaccination facilities use their doses within one week of receiving them. Henderson says if the state can show they are depleting their shipments each week, they are more likely to receive a higher number from the federal government.

She adds the changeover to the Biden Administration in Washington DC has left the near future a little unknown but the state is expecting new federal vaccination directions soon.

“We’ve got the new Biden Administration and we’ll be getting more guidelines,” she says. “Things are a little bit uncertain right now just because new people are coming in and are changing their processes, so we’re just kind of waiting to see what that looks like. In the meantime, our message to our local health departments is please get 100% of the vaccines in arms within seven days, faster if you can.”

Bush. It was written on stationery that featured an illustration of an elephant surrounded by turkeys with the caption, ""Don't let the turkeys get you down.""

Every president since has left a letter for his successor to find as they enter the Oval Office.

Although President Donald Trump on Wednesday left the White House before the inauguration of President Joe Biden began, the outgoing chief executive did leave a note for his successor.

But images of Trump's note circulating on social media are fake. The phony letter is topped with the presidential seal, dated ""20th January 2021,"" and includes the message, ""Joe, you know I won."" Trump's signature is at the bottom.

The false note originated on a blog post that claimed, ""I was sent this 5pm British time -- And asked not to share for 1 hour.""

This is not a letter from Trump, according to PolitiFact.com. The presidential seal at the top of the letter isn't the seal that has appeared on other letters from Trump. And in those letters, the month appeared before the date.

After the inauguration, Biden confirmed he had received a ""very generous letter"" from Trump, but declined to reveal the message.

""Because it was private, I won't talk about it until I talk to him,"" Biden said.

""It's a letter between 45 and 46,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere told USA Today.

A fake letter supposedly written by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi showed up on social media shortly after videos showed rioters rooting through Pelosi's office during a Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol building in Washington.

The letter was purportedly written by Pelosi, telling Portland, Oregon, Mayor Ted Wheeler to ""stick to the proven Democratic Play book"" following August protests and riots in the city after the death of George Floyd.

""Go on Television and Condemn TRUMP and refuse any assistance! We CANNOT give TRUMP any victory before the election!!!!!"" the fake letter read.

A spokesperson from Pelosi's office told The Associated Press the letter was fabricated. In addition to the bad grammar and informal language, there is a fake Pelosi signature.

A spokesperson from Wheeler's office told the AP the letter, which has been widely shared on Facebook, Twitter and Parler, is fake.

After 493 claims, still not the greatest

Before leaving office, President Donald Trump released a taped farewell address. The video included a variety of claims that have been debunked, according to The Washington Post.

Included was a false statement about building the ""greatest economy,"" which the president repeated 493 times during his term, the Post said.

""We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world,"" Trump said during the speech. ""Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.""

But economic growth was stronger under presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton, the Post said.

The gross domestic product under Trump grew at a rate of 2.4%, 2.9% and 2.3% from 2017 to 2019. Under Clinton's watch, the GDP rose from 4.5% to 4.7%, under Johnson it rose to 6.6% in 1966, and was as high as 8% when Eisenhower took office.

The unemployment rate was as low as 3.5% under Trump but that is still not as low as it was in 1953 when it dropped to 2.5% under Eisenhower.

President Joe Biden's Presidential Inaugural Committee, or PIC, installed an art display on the National Mall in Washington ahead of the inauguration.

The Field of Flags display, which featured nearly 200,000 flags including those from each state and U.S. territory, was created to ""represent the American people who are unable to travel to Washington, DC, and reflect PIC's commitment to an inclusive and safe event that everyone can enjoy from their home,"" according to a news release from the committee.

Some social media users saw more in the colorful display. One Twitter user claimed it included the flag of the Russian Federation.

""I don't know if the Biden administration is aware of this. But this is the Russian flag. No joke,"" read the tweet, which included an emoji of the white, blue and red flag. Comments from other users agreed.

But the PIC did not display a Russian flag, according to Snopes.com. The flags, of various size and color, from a distance create a look of colorful stripes throughout the National Mall.

""The colors red, white, and blue aren't exclusive to one country's flag,"" Snopes said.

Other Twitter users who responded to the post pointed out the color combinations made up by the state flags could also resemble the French flag and the flag of the Netherlands.

418,419,https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2021/01/23/legislator-mocks-trans-biden-nominee-on-facebook-apologizes,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania legislator shared on Facebook an image mocking the appearance of the state’s recently departed health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine, a transgender woman who has been nominated to serve in the Biden administration, and then offered a general apology Saturday.

State Rep. Jeff Pyle, a Republican from Armstrong and Indiana counties in western Pennsylvania, said on Facebook that he “had no idea” the post mocking Levine “would be … received as poorly as it was” but that “tens of thousands of heated emails assured me it was.”

“I owe an apology and I offer it humbly,” Pyle said, not specifically apologizing to Levine or other transgender people, but later repeating an apology “to all affected.”

Levine has not commented. The state health department did not immediately respond to an email seeking a reaction to Pyle’s initial post or his apology.

Comments on his Facebook page had called for him to resign.

President Joe Biden tapped Levine a day before his inauguration be his assistant secretary of health, leaving her poised to become the first openly transgender federal official to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

Pyle, who was first elected in 2004, cited a conversation with the Democratic leader in the state House “who explained the error of my post.” He stressed that he did not come up with the meme but merely shared it, though he said he should not have done so.

“From this situation I have learned to not poke fun at people different than me and to hold my tongue. Be a bigger man,” he wrote.

Pyle wrote he would leave Facebook “soon” but was not resigning and would focus on a Butler Community College project and the economic revitalization of Pennsylvania amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Legislator mocks trans Biden nominee on Facebook, apologizes",www.boston.com
419,420,https://www.grandforksherald.com/newsmd/coronavirus/6854666-Vaccine-providers-ask-for-patience-as-rollout-sparks-what-about-me-questions,"FARGO — As North Dakota and Minnesota roll out their COVID-19 vaccination programs, many people have been left wondering when they can get the vaccine — and where.

In response, area vaccinators are asking for the public's patience, as the federal dispersal of vaccine has often been unpredictable and in smaller amounts than health care providers have hoped.

All of that makes communicating concrete expectations to the public difficult, according to health officials, whose perspectives on vaccine distribution are reflected below in question-and-answer format.

In some cases, answers have been edited for space and clarity.

Q: How are COVID-19 vaccines being distributed in the U.S.?

A: Because very few doses of vaccine will be available initially, a phased-in approach is occurring. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices determines priority groups and state officials review federal guidelines in coming up with their own priorities when it comes to who gets vaccinated first.

Q: Where is North Dakota in its vaccine rollout?

A: Health care workers in North Dakota are finishing up vaccinating people in what is known as the phase 1A priority category. In North Dakota, phase 1A groups include health care workers in direct contact with COVID-19, first responders and long-term care residents and staff.

At the same time, vaccinators in North Dakota are starting to vaccinate people in what are considered to be phase 1B groups. In descending order of priority, those groups include:

People 75 and older; persons 65-74 with two or more high-risk medical conditions; staff and persons living in certain congregate settings; persons 65 and older with one or more high-risk medical conditions; persons 65 and older with or without high-risk medical conditions; persons with two or more high-risk medical conditions regardless of age; child care workers; workers employed by preschools or kindergarten through 12th grade; teachers, nutritional services, aides, bus drivers, principals, administrative staff, custodians, etc.

Q: Where is Minnesota in its vaccine distribution?

A: Minnesota health care providers are aiming to finish vaccinating their phase 1A groups by the end of January, with the lag largely due to vaccinators not getting the amount of vaccine they requested or were promised, public health officials say.

Those phase 1A groups include: hospital staff working with patients who may have COVID-19; staff and residents in skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes; emergency workers who provide direct patient care; COVID-19 testers; and COVID-19 vaccinators.

Minnesota has yet to completely define who will be served in its phase 1B effort, or when that effort will start.

However, Minnesota recently set up nine pilot sites to serve adults 65 or older, pre-kindergarten through 12th grade educators, school staff, and child care workers, essentially adding those populations to its list of phase 1A groups.

The sites include locations in Fergus Falls, St. Cloud and Thief River Falls.

Residents 65 years or older may register to be vaccinated at a pilot site, or placed on a wait list, by visiting www.mn.gov/covid19/ under ""Find My Vaccine,"" or by calling 612-426-7230, or toll free at 833-431-2053.

Q: How will I know when I can get a COVID-19 vaccination shot?

A: In general, if someone is a patient of a private health care provider such as Sanford Health or Essentia Health, those providers know who you are and will reach out to you to establish a communication plan and, ultimately, to arrange an appointment for getting a shot when vaccine becomes available for your priority group.

People not affiliated with a health care provider will be vaccinated by public health agencies at the point in time their particular demographic becomes eligible for shots.

Q: What are health care providers doing to communicate vaccine information to the public?

A: Holly Scott, communications specialist at Fargo Cass Public Health, echoed many in the health care field interviewed for this story when she said this about the area's vaccine rollout:

""There's a newness to it and there's a learning curve and there are processes that need to be put in place,"" Scott said.

""No single provider is going to be able to answer every single question that comes up, especially when it comes to vaccine availability,"" Scott said, adding: ""We are working so incredibly hard to be available, to be a place they (patients) can come and tell us, 'Hey, I'm here, don't forget about me.'

""We ask for patience,"" Scott said. ""Not everyone will be able to be vaccinated all at the same time. We're going to provide multiple vaccination opportunities as we work through the different priority groups in phase 1B.""

422,423,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1797381/middle-east,"TRIPOLI: Foreign forces ignored a deadline to pull out of Libya as scheduled on Saturday under a UN-backed cease-fire deal, highlighting the fragility of peace efforts after a decade of conflict.

Satellite images broadcast by CNN show a trench running tens of kilometers dug by “Russian mercenaries” near the frontline coastal city of Sirte, as main foreign protagonists Ankara and Moscow appear intent on defending their interests under any final settlement.

 An unidentified US intelligence official, quoted by the American news network, said there was “no intent or movement by either Turkish or Russian forces to abide by the UN-brokered agreement.”

 “This has the potential to derail an already fragile peace process and cease-fire. It will be a really difficult year ahead,” he said.

 UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday urged all “regional and international actors to respect the provisions” of the Oct. 23 cease-fire accord that set out a withdrawal within three months of all foreign troops and mercenaries.

 That deadline passed on Saturday, with no movement announced or observed on the ground.

 The UN estimates there are still some 20,000 foreign troops and mercenaries in Libya helping the warring factions, the UN-recognized Government of National Accord in Tripoli and military strongman Khalifa Haftar in the east. The GNA has received military support from Turkey. Haftar has the backing of Russia.

 Guterres called on all parties to implement the terms of the cease-fire “without delay,” something he noted “includes ensuring the departure of all foreign fighters and mercenaries from Libya, and the full and unconditional respect of the Security Council arms embargo,” which has been in place since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that ousted and killed longtime ruler Muammar Qaddafi.

Any withdrawal or end to foreign interference “does not depend on the Libyans but on the outside powers,” said Khaled Al-Montasser, professor of international relations at Tripoli University.

 Turkey on Friday welcomed a deal reached at UN-backed talks for Libya’s warring factions to set up an interim executive to rule the North African country until polls in December.

 Turkey has backed the GNA with military advisers, materiel and mercenaries, repelling an advance on Tripoli by Haftar’s forces, and it also has a military base in Al-Watiya on the border with Tunisia under a 2019 military accord.

 Last December, parliament in Ankara extended by 18 months its authorization for Turkey’s troop deployment in Libya, in apparent disregard of the cease-fire deal.

 “The mercenaries are unlikely to leave Libya so long as the countries which have engaged them have not guaranteed their interests in the new transitional phase,” said Montasser, referring to the multiple tracks of UN-sponsored talks currently underway.

 “Their presence keeps alive the threat of military confrontation at any moment, while the current calm staying in place seems uncertain,” he said.

 Most of the foreign forces are concentrated around Sirte, at Al-Jufra airbase held by Haftar’s forces 500 km south of Tripoli and further west in Al-Watiya.",Foreign forces ignore UN’s Libya exit deadline under fragile truce,www.arabnews.com

The attack took place in the evening when IS militants attacked the outposts of Hashd Shaabi's 22nd Brigade in the Himreen area in the eastern part of Salahudin, Mohammed al-Bazi told Xinhua.

The five killed Hashd Shaabi members included the Brigade's commander Abu Alyaa al-Husseini, al-Bazi said.

Reinforcement troops were dispatched to the area to support the Hashd Shaabi members, he added, noting there were no immediate reports about casualties of the extremist militants.

The attack came as the IS militants intensified attacks on the security forces, including Hashd Shaabi forces, and civilians in the formerly IS-controlled Sunni provinces in Iraq. The extremist group has claimed Thursday's twin suicide bombings in a bustling outdoor market in downtown Baghdad that killed 32 and wounded more than 100 others.

The security situation in Iraq has been improving since Iraqi security forces fully defeated the IS militants across the country late in 2017.

However, IS remnants have since melted in urban areas or deserts and rugged areas, carrying out frequent guerilla attacks against security forces and civilians.",5 Hashd Shaabi members killed in IS attack in Iraq,www.middleeaststar.com

A resident of Balad, Najih Shaker Al-Baldwai, physically stopped the suicide bomber to prevent him from committing the horrendous crime.

The bomber intended to attack the Sayyed Mohammed Shrine located in Balad city. The physical altercation happened outside the shrine where Najih tried to stop the Islamic State bomber from entering the place. During this, the bomber detonated the explosives, killing both of them.

According to the Awareness Act, there were around 37 people killed and 70 others injured in the blast. However, if Najih had not have intervened by throwing himself on the bomber, the blast would have taken the lives of hundreds.

This incident comes just days after the attack in Karrada area of Iraq, which resulted in the death of 300 people. The bombers from the Islamic State disguise themselves as a local militia with the aim to destroy the monumental Shia shrines. Had Najih not intervened, this bomber would have destroyed the shrine.

According to the News, the UN’s top Iraq envoy Jan Kubis said,

427,428,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/23/lawsuit-fraternity-hazing-led-to-unl-students-suic/,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - A lawsuit alleges that weeks of fraternity hazing led a University of Nebraska-Lincoln student to kill himself.

Kam Rokon claims in the lawsuit filed in Lancaster County District Court that his brother, Rahat Jalil, was forced to stand outside all night with no clothes on and was told to urinate on other pledges who didn’t follow directions before his death in January 2019. He was 18, The Lincoln Journal-Star reports.

The suit seeks unspecified damages from Lambda Phi Epsilon International and the fraternity’s Nebraska chapter. It says the fraternity didn’t have policies in place or enforce those it did, nor did it provide the supervision required to ensure Jalil’s safety.

Katie Cheatle, the attorney representing the Nebraska chapter of Lambda Phi Epsilon, said the fraternity members were saddened by the loss of their brother and refute that anything the fraternity did is related to his death.

The local chapter of Lambda Phi Epsilon, an Asian-centered fraternity, was founded in 2016, joining three other chapters in UNL’s Multicultural Greek Council. The fraternity does not have a house on campus, and therefore is not subject to university-approved housing rules.

429,430,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/innu-children-sar-inquries-1.5885433,"After an long-awaited inquiry into ground search and rescue was formally established earlier this month, Liberal Leader Andrew Furey says another inquiry, one looking into Innu children in care, won't start until the search and rescue inquiry is finished.

The provincial government established the search and rescue inquiry in a wave of announcements on Jan. 14, the day before the election was called.

The inquiry into search and rescue was promised in 2015, after 14-year-old Burton Winters perished when his snowmobile became stuck on the sea ice outside Makkovik three years prior.

Burton's family has repeatedly asked for the inquiry to begin and explain why it took two days for a military aircraft to be dispatched to aid ground search and rescue. However, the search and rescue inquiry will focus on policy, not investigation. It will hold one hearing into the search for Burton Winters.

It's not clear when inquiry commissioner and former provincial court justice James Igloliorte will begin formally gathering facts and holding hearings, but proceedings are expected to wrap up sometime in June.

But Furey says the long-awaited inquiry into Innu children in care in Newfoundland and Labrador won't happen at the same time.

""They're not going to happen simultaneously, but we have had really good progress with the Innu Nation and it looks like we've secured a council and a framework to move forward,"" Furey said Thursday.

The province said more than three years ago it would launch an inquiry into Innu children in the child-care system, but there's been little to no movement since.

The suicide of Innu teen Wally Rich, while he was in the care of a group home in the child protection system in May 2020, renewed calls for that inquiry to begin last year. A shortage of Supreme Court judges hindered the search for a commissioner for the inquiry, and the Innu Nation previously agreed agreed to allow a commissioner from out of the province to head the inquiry.

PC Leader Ches Crosbie said Saturday he doesn't know why the inquiry into Innu children in care has taken so long.

""This has been bouncing around for something like three years, I think. The point about that is that it should have been done and over with by now,"" he said.

""I don't understand why the government is dragging its feet.""

Alison Coffin, leader of the New Democratic party, echoed Crosbie's comments.

""I think that we need to start that inquiry sooner rather than later. I don't understand why they would think that they can't be concurrent,"" she said.

""Those are two separate and distinct things and I think they both deserve to be addressed. [It's] something that we said we were going to do for a really long time; I'm not sure why he's put it off.""

The Innu Nation says it will have more to say about the inquiry and other issues next week.

Summer Nuclear Station expansion went belly up, state legislators have been so fixated on efforts to sell Santee Cooper that they’ve done practically nothing to fix Santee Cooper.

We’re delighted that the House is finally poised to correct that oversight.

Representatives are expected to pass a bill this week that reforms the utility’s governance and regulation — modestly in the first case and significantly in the second, since it's currently unregulated.

House leaders say their goal still is to sell the state-owned utility, so H.3194 also opens a new round of bidding — which might or might not land a better offer than the disastrous 2019-20 effort that gave us a bid that would have resulted in massive layoffs and raised customers' power bills without any guarantee that they wouldn't have gone even higher and wouldn't have netted a penny for the state.

Rep. Kirkman Finlay, one of the architects of the legislation, assured us that “We have no intention of fire-selling this asset"" but that lawmakers realize ""we’ve got to make sure it’s an asset, and in order to do that were gonna have to do a lot of reform.”

Although a temporary law has curtailed its autonomy while the Legislature considers its fate, the regular state law that has governed Santee Cooper for decades allows its completely autonomous board to decide what projects to build and how much to charge ratepayers for power. In other words, it is unregulated by either the rest of state government or the free market — a recipe for disaster.

H.3194 requires the utility to get the same Public Service Commission approval as other utilities for large construction projects, joint operating agreements, borrowing and a green-energy plan. Santee Cooper would have to pursue cost-sharing arrangements with neighboring utilities and take public comment on proposed rate hikes, which gives its captive customers an opportunity to complain but little more.

Lawmakers say covenants in Santee Cooper’s outstanding bonds make it financially impossible to subject it to rate review by the PSC, and they’re probably right. But they certainly could — and should — prohibit the utility from issuing any more bonds with those restrictions, so we could regulate its rates once the old bonds mature.

The bill also ends the terms of the current Santee Cooper board members and imposes professional qualification requirements and term limits for new members. Those are probably good changes, but they don’t address the central problem: The board would remain completely autonomous.

Although the governor appoints its members, neither he nor anyone else can fire them before their terms end unless they refuse to show up for meetings or commit malfeasance, misfeasance or other actions that could subject them to criminal prosecution under the state’s overly broad misconduct in office law. They cannot be removed simply because they made hideous decisions that left ratepayers on the hook for $4 billion for a pair of unfinished nuclear reactors that will never produce a single watt of electricity.

Please read that again, because apparently a lot of legislators don’t realize how severely the law limits the governor’s ability to remove board members. Lawmakers need to finally come to terms with this, and they need to correct that problem, which we are convinced is the single biggest reason that not only Santee Cooper’s but also the former SCE&G’s customers will be paying for the V.C. Summer fiasco for decades.

On the sale side, we’re concerned about the absence of provisions to limit how much utilities could shower legislators with campaign donations, jobs and other benefits, as Santee Cooper supporters imply NextEra did before some restrictions were imposed leading up to the first round of bidding. If lawmakers agree to keep the sale provisions in the bill, they should add in some of those protections, along with an independent analysis of a proposed sale before it can go through — which seems like an obvious need given how attractive the NextEra bid looked prior to such an analysis.",Editorial: Santee Cooper reform plan ignores central problem.

432,433,https://y105fm.com/will-mn-businesses-be-taxed-on-their-forgivable-ppp-loans/,"Local chambers are asking the Minnesota legislature to make changes to Minnesota's tax code so it conforms to the federal law, in order to save small Minnesota businesses money in taxes. Minnesota's legislature, if it does nothing, will end up leaving Minnesota businesses 'on the hook' for the taxes on the PPP forgivable loans they received earlier in the year.

The University of Minnesota Extension Office wrote about this issue back in December, I've included a portion of that article written by Rob Holcomb and Megan Roberts, as to how we got into the position of PPP being taxable in Minnesota and not federally.

""With the passage of new COVID-19 relief legislation on December 21, also known as H.R.133 or the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, taxpayers are no longer required to reduce business expenses on the federal tax return by the amount of PPP loan forgiveness they received or expect to receive in the future. This causes the PPP loan forgiveness to be non-taxable on the federal return but taxable on the Minnesota return. A Minnesota taxpayer with PPP loan forgiveness starts with PPP forgiveness and then subtracts the amount of reduced expenses from the Federal return. Since there will be no reduction of expenses on the federal return, the total amount of PPP loan forgiveness is an add back on the Minnesota return, thus increasing Minnesota taxable income.""

Basically what the above passage is saying is that right now, if you were to do your taxes and you owned a business Minnesota would tax you on your PPP.

My hope is that Minnesota's legislature acts on this problem, and confirms it's tax code to match that of the federal tax code, as PPP was used as a liferaft for many Minnesota businesses, and now it appears that liferaft is headed towards some jagged rocks.

The Old Testament Scriptures reveal to us the origin of mankind ...

“Then God said, ""Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."" 27God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.” —Genesis 1:26-27 And also, in Genesis 5:1-2, “. . . when God created man, He made him in the likeness of God. 2He created them male and female, and He blessed them and named them Man in the day when they were created.” —Genesis 5:1-2

The New Testament Scriptures repeat this same historic truth claim . . .

“For a man . . . is the image and glory of God . . .” —1 Corinthians 11:7

Implicit in the God-inspired (2 Timothy 3:16) words of these verses of Scripture is the sole basis for the inherent worth of every human life. Note well, that this inherent worth and value is not based upon anything a person may do; it is not based upon a person’s status and stature in life; it is not based upon a person’s position in society or in government; it is not based upon a person’s talents, abilities, wealth, intellect, or beauty. It is not based upon anything at all about what any person has accomplished, can accomplish, or will accomplish in their life. It is not based upon anything about any particular person — except for one thing, and that one thing is what God has already done. He has created every person in His very Own image and likeness.

Theologians agree that this is at the very least a reference to mankind being the only material, moral creation of God — man alone, of all of God’s material creation, possesses a sense of morality (what is good and what is evil). To illustrate: a lioness kills a zebra, but she does not murder it. A male great white shark forcibly copulates with a female great white shark, but he doesn’t rape it. No one attaches any crime to these actions of animals — they have no moral quality when these acts are committed by these animals because these animals have no moral sense (not being created in God’s image and likeness). Yet precisely these same actions, if performed by a person, a human being, would be considered immoral, and a crime worthy of punishment. What separates the consequences of these actions when engaged in by animals versus when engaged in by a person? It is simply that a person, and a person alone, is a moral creature — able to distinguish right from wrong because every person is created in God’s very Own image and likeness. It doesn’t matter what age that person is, or what gender that person is. Every person. That’s right, every person bearing the DNA associated with humans is a moral being created in God’s image and likeness; and this DNA is evident at the very onset of conception, therefore every embryo growing within the womb is a person, not just a collection of cells.

It is ultimately on the basis of being created in God’s image that gives every person worth. It is solely upon this same basis that every person has value. It is purely upon this basis that every human life must be treated with dignity. Every life! No exceptions. Does someone claim that there are exceptions? Let them first find such a person who does not possess the DNA of a human being. Science tells us who a human being is; a human being has the DNA associated with a human being. Any living entity possessing the DNA associated with human beings can only develop into ... that’s right ... a human being. Such a person cannot develop into a tadpole, cannot develop into a bird, cannot develop into a dog, and even cannot develop into a chimpanzee. They can only, and always will, develop into a human being. To exclude any living entity, possessing the DNA associated with the human race, from human personhood, is to deny science. Only a science-denier can exclude any living entity possessing the DNA associated with the human race from personhood and humanity. And, any such science-denier is simply a hypocrite. How so? Simply because such a person would appeal to their own DNA as the foundational, scientific basis for their very own inclusion in the human race, thus demanding all the rights, justice, and equitable treatment accorded to anyone belonging to the human race. Dogs are not human beings. It is not simply that they don’t look like us, but because of something deeper. On a biblical basis, it is because they are not created in God’s image. On a scientific basis, it is because they do not possess human DNA. The Bible and Science both agree on precisely who is to be included as a human, that is to say, a person.

So, today, do you agree with the Bible as to who is a human being, a person? Today, do you agree with Science as to who is a human being, a person? If so, then how should you be treating all those who are persons created in God’s image, all those possessing human DNA? While both the Bible and Science can tell us who a human being possessing personhood is, only the Bible can tell us how we are to treat all those possessing personhood: “... according to the image of the One who created him ... put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience; bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you. Beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity. Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.” — Colossians 3:10, 12-14, 17

This, then, is how we ought to treat all, without exception, who are our fellow humans, all who possess personhood, and most importantly, ALL who are created in God’s image!

434,435,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/23/kentucky-gop-group-rejects-push-to-have-mcconnell-/,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) - A Kentucky Republican Party committee on Saturday rejected a resolution urging Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell to fully support Donald Trump in the ex-president’s upcoming impeachment trial.

The GOP State Central Committee met to consider the proposal after a grassroots group of Republican officials pushed the resolution, news outlets reported.

The meeting was called by a small group of officials, the party said in a statement following the gathering. The party said it’s in a position to “bring all sides of our organization together to have conversations about the direction we are going in and what we expect from our elected officials.”

“In the end it is our intention to return our focus to bringing civility to the party and continue having larger conversations about how we can attract more voters and grow our party,” the statement said.

Opening arguments in Trump’s Senate impeachment trial over the Capitol riot will begin the week of Feb. 8. It will be the first such impeachment trial of a U.S. president no longer in office. If Trump is convicted, the Senate could vote to bar him from holding office ever again.

McConnell, who said recently that Trump “provoked” his supporters before the riot, has not said how he will vote. McConnell also said that Senate Republicans “strongly believe we need a full and fair process where the former president can mount a defense and the Senate can properly consider the factual, legal and constitutional questions.”

McConnell won reelection last year and is considered the main architect of the GOP‘s rise to dominance in Kentucky. McConnell was one of Trump’s chief defenders during the ex-president’s first impeachment and the ensuing Senate trial.

But the senator’s recent comments spurred the grassroots group to force the special meeting Saturday on the resolution urging McConnell to support Trump in the upcoming impeachment trial.

The GOP committee has more than 350 members, including the chairs and vice chairs of county-level Republican parties as well as elected officials who are part of the GOP, according to a state party employee.

Nelson County GOP Chairman Don Thrasher, who pushed for the meeting, said Saturday he could not comment on it. He did say, however, that he felt like many of the Republican elected officials in the state are out of touch with the party‘s base, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported.",Kentucky GOP group rejects push to have McConnell back Trump,www.washingtontimes.com

Garret Miller, who is from the Dallas suburb of Richardson, was arrested on Friday after being named in a five-count federal complaint.

Authorities allege that Miller posted photos and videos on his social media accounts that show him inside the Capitol during the January 6 storming of the building by supporters of then-president Donald Trump.

It is also alleged that he called for violence in online posts, including a tweet that simply read: “Assassinate AOC,” a reference to Ms Ocasio-Cortez.

In another tweet, Miller posted: “They are right next time we bring the guns,” an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit.

Miller also threatened a US Capitol police officer during an exchange on Instagram, writing that he planned to “hug his neck with a nice rope”, the affidavit states.

After posting a photo on Facebook showing him inside the Capitol, Miller responded to a comment on the picture with: “just want to incriminate myself a little lol,” according to an FBI affidavit.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez posted Miller’s charging documents on Twitter on Friday and then tweeted: “On one hand you have to laugh, and on the other know that the reason they were this brazen is because they thought they were going to succeed.”

Miller’s lawyer, Clint Broden, said his client regrets the actions he took “in a misguided effort to show his support for former President Trump.

“His social media comments reflect very ill-considered political hyperbole in very divided times and will certainly not be repeated in the future,” Mr Broden said.

“He looks forward to putting all of this behind him.

“We are hopeful that, given his family support and regret for his actions, he will be released so that he can resolve the charges against him in a timely fashion.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and a US Capitol Police officer.

Garret Miller, 34, of Richardson, Texas, faces five criminal charges stemming from the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection knowingly entering or remaining in restricted buildings, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, obstructing or impeding an official proceeding, civil disorder and making threats.

According to court documents, Miller posted extensively on social media before and during the attack.

His posts include photos of himself participating in the insurrection, which have been corroborated by footage from other parties.

Miller also wrote on social media that the officer who fatally shot a 35-year-old Trump supporter ""deserves to die"" and replied to one of Ocasio-Cortez's tweets with ""Assassinate AOC.""

According to the DOJ, he was arrested Wednesday, with federal prosecutors asking a judge to keep him in jail pending trial.

Weekday morning reporter Michael Henrich announced on Thursday that he will depart the station after six years, saying that he was told by station management that his contract would not be renewed due to budgetary issues related to COVID-19.

In an emotional video posted to Facebook, Henrich thanked viewers for allowing him to be a trusted news source and part of their morning viewing.

“Just know how truly grateful I am that all of you have trusted me to be one source of information about our community,” Henrich said. “I really loved sharing your stories and being part of your lives.”

A New York native who has family in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, Henrich arrived at Boston 25 News in January 2015, just as the region was hit with record-setting snowfall.

Prior to his time at Boston 25 News, Henrich worked in various roles at stations in Indiana (WXIN-FOX59 and WTTV-CBS4), Oklahoma (KOKH-FOX25), Ohio (WNWO-NBC24), Vermont (WFFF-FOX44/WVNY-ABC22), New York (News 12 Interactive), and Washington, D.C. (ABC News).

News of Henrich’s departure came a week after Boston 25 News anchor Daniel Miller announced he was leaving the station for a job as the main morning anchor of WXIN Fox 59 in Indianapolis.

A spokesperson for Boston 25 News had not returned a request for comment at the time of this article’s publication.

In a statement sent to Boston.com, Henrich emphasized that his situation is not a unique one given the economic hardships caused by the pandemic, and that he was grateful for his time at Boston 25 News.

“For nearly 15 years, I’ve felt so fortunate to be a journalist; informing our community, meeting new people each day, and working alongside such talented colleagues in the process,” Henrich said. “Losing your job due to the economy is difficult, as far too many people know so well. I don’t wish to present my situation as special or unique, as I feel deeply for those who have been struggling with similar circumstances for months now.

“Still, I would like to share how thankful I remain for the journey to this point, for my family and for the overwhelming support from viewers and friends alike,” Henrich continued. “Whether I remain in the field or chart a new course, Massachusetts is now my home and I hope the public knows how much I valued the responsibility of earning and maintaining their trust with each report.”",Boston 25 News reporter Michael Henrich is leaving the station,www.boston.com
439,440,https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2021-02-01/military-track-combat-injuries-working-dogs,"A military spending bill passed by Congress at the start of the new year includes provisions that will improve the health and welfare of military working dogs and promote responsible dog ownership in military communities.

President Donald Trump had initially vetoed the $741 billion National Defense Authorization Act on Dec. 23, 2020, after lawmakers declined to add a provision repealing an internet liability law as requested by the president. Both the House and Senate subsequently overrode the veto, on Dec. 28 and Jan. 1, respectively.

Military working dogs are highly trained canine soldiers that serve in combat operations around the world. Language in the defense authorization act is a key step in creating an MWD Trauma Registry to track the leading causes of morbidity and mortality of military working dogs in combat.

The AVMA says the registry will lead to better medical outcomes for dogs injured in the line of duty. “AVMA will continue to advocate for military working dogs by urging Congress to ensure that the DOD (Department of Defense) develops and implements the trauma registry and provides additional trauma training to Army (Veterinary) Corps veterinarians so they may develop the most effective treatments for military working dogs’ combat injuries,” the Association said in a statement.

The act also directs the Defense Department to adopt a uniform policy on pets in military communities, to be developed in consultation with the veterinary profession. The AVMA anticipates that its policies on dangerous animals, animal control, and other topics will be used to support the DOD’s work.

“This is an additional opportunity for the AVMA to ensure the Defense Department adopts strong policy promoting responsible pet ownership and enhancing animal and public safety on military bases,” the AVMA said.",Military to track combat injuries in working dogs,www.avma.org
440,441,https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/santa-monica-police-report/,"Not only did Santa Monica police lose control of public order during a chaotic day of looting last May, according to new information that has surfaced since Los Angeles published a detailed expose of the debacle, the oceanside city has made a considerable mess of the aftermath, too.

Documents obtained via public records requests and new interviews reveal that Santa Monica hired two seasoned veterans of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, now working as private consultants, to conduct a postmortem and recommend corrective action within weeks of the police department ceding control of large swaths of the city to opportunists who ransacked hundreds of storefronts with impunity. An underprepared and understaffed police department had focused its attention on a largely peaceful Black Lives Matter protest near the oceanfront and failed to respond to emergency calls from hundreds of panicked residents elsewhere who were fearful for their property and their personal safety.

The veteran sheriff’s deputies soon found serious flaws in the Santa Monica police leadership from the lieutenant level up, according to a source familiar with their findings, and were particularly concerned with the performance of a captain who deputized for the chief for several days while she was out of town. The consultants also saw serious problems with the department’s intelligence gathering, planning, and deployment.

Until now, though, none of their findings about the events of May 31—or even the existence of their investigation—have seen the light of day.

The consultants, operating under the name Field Command, typed up their findings and shared them with a lieutenant reporting directly to the police chief. Under the terms of their contract, this was exactly how they supposed to write the post-mortem (known officially as an “after-action report”)—in conjunction with the police department. But the details of their findings never made it into a draft report that the lieutenant submitted to city leadership in early August, either, according to a number of sources close to the situation, because they were considered too damning to commit to writing, or because city leaders were worried about legal exposure, or both.

When the city’s top executive, interim city manager Lane Dilg, saw the heavily truncated draft report, she found it so poor she “threw up all over it,” according to one person she confided in. That person, who requested anonymity to protect his relationships, says Dilg didn’t just reject the report, she suppressed it altogether. Interviews with several of Santa Monica’s seven elected council members make clear that they were never told about the report, nor were they told that Dilg’s staff had approved spending of up to $25,000 for a postmortem many of them had been clamoring for and would now never see.

At the time, Dilg and her staff blamed the police department and its then-chief, Cynthia Renaud, for failing to pull together the after-action report they had been promising since June. The reason, council members (and this reporter) were told, was that the department was overwhelmed with the day-to-day challenge of performing its core duties at a time of continuing public unrest and a surge in the COVID-19 pandemic. As relayed by Terry O’Day, then the city’s deputy mayor, the department found it couldn’t “build the plane and fly the plane at the same time.”

This was, however, untrue.

The breakdown in communication was most painfully apparent at a council meeting on August 25, when three council members demanded an independent review to do a job that, as far as they were aware, the police department had failed to do. Sue Himmelrich, who led the initial charge for a quick accounting of what went wrong on May 31 and has since become the city’s mayor, told the meeting it was important to “get some people in there to get it done”. She specifically called for outside experts to help the police pull together their information and reach some initial conclusions.

Neither Dilg nor George Cardona, the city attorney who had approved the hiring of the two former sheriff’s deputies as a member of the city spending review committee, let Himmelrich know that the very thing she was demanding had already happened. In her public comments that day, Dilg said: “It’s important the community have transparency and accountability around what happened.” Yet she offered no transparency at all about the investigation she’d just quashed.

Dilg refused to give point-by-point answers to a list of questions from Los Angeles. Instead, her office issued a carefully worded general statement that acknowledged the hiring of the outside firm—saying it was Chief Renaud who made the call—but provided few other details. Asked if she had misled council members or the public, Dilg offered no reply. (Dilg has announced she will be leaving her job in the spring, for unrelated reasons. Chief Renaud, meanwhile, was pressed into early retirement last October.)

Santa Monica’s handling of the aftermath of its public safety disaster has been thrown into sharp relief by the reverberations from the violent takeover of the U.S. Capitol on January 6. It has not gone unnoticed in Santa Monica government circles that the chief of the Capitol Police and the sergeants-at-arms in the House and Senate quit right away—not five months later as Renaud did. Nobody gave the Capitol Police a “strong A” for their performance, as Dilg gave the SMPD, and nobody came out the next morning to declare “a bright and beautiful day,” as city officials did in a jarring news conference at the entrance to the Santa Monica Pier on June 1.

The greatly increased threat of far-right extremist violence around the country has also underscored the urgent need for Santa Monica, like other jurisdictions, to get its security house in order. The Proud Boys, implicated in the charge on the Capitol, made appearances in Santa Monica in 2017 to harass a Committee for Racial Justice set up in the wake of the violent white supremacist march in Charlottesville, so the city has specific reason to worry.

The retired sheriff’s deputies from Field Command, Sid Heal and Richard “Odie” Odenthal, both had solid reputations and broad experience as emergency operations managers when Chief Renaud approached them in mid-June. But their hiring also raised questions. Heal acknowledged that he and Renaud were personal friends, and he asked at the outset if hiring him was appropriate.

“The chief didn’t blink an eye,” Heal said in an interview. “We had an agreement, that there would be no sacred cows…She didn’t care what the answers were but she wanted to know.”

It may not have worked out so smoothly in practice. According to Heal, Renaud was more than happy to receive verbal briefings but was skittish about what would appear in writing. In an email written in late June, Heal proposed Field Command’s standard template for analysis: identifying issues one by one, presenting a detailed discussion of each, and concluding with recommendations. Soon after, though, the firm heard via their main point of contact, Lt. Joseph Cortez, that this format was not going to work.

“The impression we had was that [the city] might not want to have it said right out there, in case what we wrote was used to sue the city,” Heal said. “We had pages and pages of notes we’d crafted… . In some cases we had names of people who were involved. Typically in after-action reports they leave out names. In this particular case, though, it was obvious [who was at fault].”

Heal and Odenthal gave the notes to Cortez, who “paraphrased” them, in Heal’s parlance, to such a degree that the end result was all but useless. The source familiar with Dilg’s thinking said she found the report to be “garbage.” “It wasn’t thorough. It didn’t have tight reasoning. It was just piece of puffery,” the source said.

Dilg did not take issue with this characterization—and neither did Heal. “I don’t know about the puffery part, but otherwise I would agree with that,” Heal said. “Joe [Cortez] did the paraphrasing, and he did it at the direction of somebody.” Heal said he did not know who directed Cortez, but he added: “I know he talked to the chief a lot.”

Renaud could be reached for comment.

Dilg, in her statement, said that Field Command’s materials had been forwarded to the OIR Group, the independent organization now working on a fuller and more expensive report on the events of May 31. That report is not expected before April—11 months after the events in question. It is not clear, however, if Dilg ever saw Field Command’s detailed notes alongside the “paraphrased” report she found so badly wanting. If she did, it is also unclear why she chose not to publish those findings in response to considerable pressure from council members and an unnerved Santa Monica public.

One problem may have been that Field Command was too willing to lay blame on Renaud’s deputy, Captain Darrick Jacob, who’s since been promoted to deputy chief, and not willing enough to blame Renaud, who left town to attend her daughter’s high school graduation and did not return until the morning of May 31–three days after the graduation ceremony. The city’s fire chief and head of dispatch were also out of town, despite safety concerns associated with protests that had continued to grow all week across the Los Angeles region. Another issue may have been a reputation Dilg has in certain quarters for holding her cards close to her chest, even in less fraught circumstances. “Lane is singularly defensive on these things,” said a former Santa Monica city official who worked closely with her in her previous job as city attorney. “I’d say that being more forthcoming is more honest… and more credible than the stonewall. Part of the stonewall is also protecting some people underneath the chief.” (A different city official took issue with this characterization of Dilg, preferring to describe her as someone who believes in “thoughtful transparency”.) Field Command ended up receiving $22,000 for its services. Renaud and Cortez were still sending each other edits of the report in late September, but by then Heal and Odenthal were long gone. “I remember thinking, what’s up with that?” Heal said. “It wasn’t going to cost them any more to let us finish. They could always throw the report away then.”

With Renaud now out of the picture—and replaced on an interim basis by her predecessor, Jacqueline Seabrooks—the spotlight is now more squarely on the ranks below chief, the ones of most concern to Heal and Odenthal.

Los Angeles sought to obtain email and text correspondence from Santa Monica’s four captains on the days around May 31, only to learn that a search of the city server had come up empty in all categories except their official city email. A prior request for Chief Renaud’s communications revealed evidence of text traffic involving the captains, suggesting they may have failed to upload their personal texts to the city server as required by the city in accordance with the California Public Records Act.

Los Angeles asked if the city was considering disciplinary action against the captains for violating the rules on the retention of electronic communications, but the city did not reply.

Of course, if you asked Johnson, he would probably say the title he loves most is dad, which is who he is two his three daughters. He seems to love the responsibilities that come with being a father and never hesitates to share his precious moments with them on social media. Now, the actor has shared some sweet photos in which he helps his youngest daughter with her hair.

Dwayne Johnson took to Instagram to share a few photos of him helping his two-year-old daughter, Tia, with her hair. Johnson seems as laser-focused as ever in the photos and, as he even jokes in the caption, his little girl seems a bit nervous in the first photo. Check out the sweet images for yourself down below:

Fatherhood comes with a number of tasks and, sometimes that includes doing your daughter’s hair. As busy as Dwayne Johnson is, you have to love that he’s able to find the time. And based on his funny caption, it sounds like he’s even become somewhat of an expert at it:

The Rock has a lot of fun spending time with his daughters and seems to cherish his moments with them. This was clear this past Christmas when the actor played “Dwanta” for his two youngest daughters. And as Dwanta, his duties ranged from helping assemble toys on Christmas day and watching movies on repeat.

Johnson’s daughter Tia has been featured in quite a few of his social media posts. But the funniest ones show the actor trying to convince the adorable kid that he’s actually the voice of the demigod Maui in Disney’s Moana. The actor has tried to make his case by singing the character’s signature song, “You’re Welcome,” but she still hasn’t quite made the connection yet. This fact didn’t stop Johnson from sharing a massive Moana achievement with her, though.

You can’t help but love the pride Johnson shows when it comes to his children. The actor truly is a family man, and you have to love just how committed he is to them.

Of course, Dwayne Johnson does still have to put bread on the table, and he certainly does that and more with all of the work he does. The busy star finished his work on Netflix’s Red Notice and is also waiting for the release of his latest Disney film, Jungle Cruise. At present, he’s also working on his autobiographical comedy series, Young Rock, and is training ahead of filming on Warner Bros. and DC’s Black Adam. Despite all of this, it’s probably a safe bet that he’ll have more downtime to spend with the kids.","Aw, Dwayne Johnson Helps His Daughter With Her Hair In Adorable Post",www.cinemablend.com
443,444,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-biofuels-idUSKBN29R2C4,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Friday it will begin delivering commercial airplanes capable of flying on 100% biofuel by the end of the decade, calling reducing environmental damage from fossil fuels the “challenge of our lifetime.”

Boeing’s goal - which requires advances to jet systems, raising fuel-blending requirements, and safety certification by global regulators - is central to a broader industry target of slashing carbon emissions in half by 2050, the U.S. planemaker said.

“It’s a tremendous challenge, it’s the challenge of our lifetime,” Boeing Director of Sustainability Strategy Sean Newsum told Reuters. “Aviation is committed to doing its part to reduce its carbon footprint.”

Commercial flying currently accounts for about 2% of global carbon emissions and about 12% of transport emissions, according to data cited by the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG).

Boeing essentially has just a decade to reach its target because jetliners that enter service in 2030 will typically stay in service through 2050.

The world’s largest aerospace company must also confront the task hobbled by the coronavirus pandemic and the 20-month grounding of its best-selling jetliner after fatal crashes, which has strained its finances and engineering resources.

Boeing isn’t starting from scratch. In 2018, it staged the world’s first commercial airplane flight using 100% biofuel on a FedEx Corp 777 freighter.

Boeing and European rival Airbus SE also work on reducing carbon emissions through weight and drag reduction on new aircraft.

As it is now, biofuels are mixed directly with conventional jet fuel up to a 50/50 blend, which is the maximum allowed under current fuel specifications, Boeing said.

Boeing first must determine what changes to make to enable safe flight on alternative fuels derived from used vegetable oil, animal fats, sugar cane, waste and other sources.

Boeing needs to work with groups that set fuel specifications such ASTM International to raise the blending limit to allow expanded use, and then convince aviation regulators globally to certify the planes as safe, Boeing said.",Boeing says its fleet will be able to fly on 100% biofuel by 2030,www.reuters.com

446,447,https://www.laprensalatina.com/group-winter-ascent-of-k2-message-of-unity-for-the-world/,"Islamabad, Jan 23 (efe-epa).- Nirmal Purja, the leader of the expedition of 10 Nepalis who became the first to complete a winter ascent of K2, the second highest mountain in the world, said Saturday that having reached the summit as a group simultaneously is a powerful message of unity for the world.

“It is a powerful message to the rest of the world. If you are united you can win, (…) divided you fail,” said the former Gurkha soldier, the elite corps of the British Army made up of Nepalese, at a press conference in Islamabad.

Purja explained how on Saturday, 10 meters from the summit, the mountaineers waited for each other to summit “shoulder to shoulder” at the same time, something decided collectively beforehand.

“The way and style and the manner we climbed the k2 is completely fair,” said the only climber in the expedition who is not a member of the Sherpa ethnic group, who have traditionally worked as porters in the shadow of famous international mountaineers.

Purja was joined by Mingma David Sherpa, Mingma Tenzing Sherpa, Sona Sherpa, Galjen Sherpa, Pem Chiri Sherpa, Dawa Temba Sherpa, Dawa Tenjin Sherpa, Kili Pemba Sherpa, and Mingma Gyalze Sherpa.

Purja, who holds the record for having climbed all 14 eight-thousanders in the shortest time, said the ascent of K2 (which is 8,611 meters high) in winter had not been achieved before because it is among the most difficult to climb, with “horrendous” temperatures below -50 degrees and hurricane-force winds.

“K2 has a higher ratio of deaths than any other mountain and that’s in summer, in winter it’s next level,” said the athlete.

K2 has claimed the lives of one in three climbers who have reached the summit, with 84 fatalities and more than 300 summits. The last one to die was Spanish climber Sergi Mingote, who did not survive a fall on the day of the long-awaited winter feat.

Purja admitted that in the most difficult moments of the climb he considered giving up and turning back, but he held on, trusted in himself and finally reached the historic summit, an attitude that he says can be applied to other areas of life.

447,448,https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/several-pak-based-terror-groups-seeking-enter-india-pok,"A group of seven terrorists, who are heavily armed, are residing in Datote of Pachiot village in PoK.

New Delhi: The newly appointed Joe Biden-led US administration is likely to face a challenging situation posed by Pakistan’s terror factory in the coming days as multiple terror teams, comprising terrorists from Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT) and Hizbul Mujahedeen (HM) are camping in various forward areas of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir with the intention of infiltrating into India to carry out suicide attacks in Kashmir and beyond.

Both the Indian political leadership and the Indian Army have made it abundantly clear in the past few years that in case of a Pakistan-backed terror attack on Indian assets and people, Indian forces will not shy away from ignoring the restrictions imposed by international boundaries and in fact cross into Pakistan to avenge the terror attacks.

India had announced in September 2016 that it had carried out a surgical strike on terrorist assets located in PoK to retaliate against the terror attack on an Army base in Uri, which led to the death of 18 Indian soldiers. Then in February 2019, India conducted an air strike in Balakot, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, against Jaish camps to avenge the terror attack in Pulwama that led to the death of 40 CRPF personnel.

Strong verifiable intelligence gathered by the Indian security agencies, and seen by The Sunday Guardian, has revealed that terrorists belonging to these terror groups—with clear instructions to carry out attacks on Army installations in Kashmir, all working separately—are desperately trying to infiltrate into India.

One group of Lashkar terrorists comprising six terrorists, which is led by a commander rank terrorist, is camping in Poonch district of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (Pok) and has been entrusted with the task of assisting in carrying out a BAT-led (Pakistan’s Border Action Team) attack on Indian soldiers. The plan is for a BAT attack, in which Pakistani Army regulars, in close coordination with terrorist groups, go across the LoC with the intention of killing Indian soldiers, mostly by using sharp weapons.

Similarly, four Jaish terrorists are camping near the International Border (IB) in the Kathua sector and are looking to cross into India through a tunnel with the help of an accomplice, whose name The Sunday Guardian is not revealing due to operational reasons. These four terrorists, according to intelligence gathered, after infiltrating into India would be walking towards NH 44 to board a commercial vehicle for their onward journey.

Another batch of six HM terrorists, including two individuals identified as Nazim and Shadaq, are moving adjacent to Indian assets on the Naushera sector with the intention to carry out attacks on Indian soldiers.

A group of seven terrorists, who are heavily armed, as per the intelligence, are residing in Datote of Pachiot village, PoK. This group, which is “desperate” to enter India, has already made two unsuccessful attempts in the last one month to cross over, but have not been able to do so.

In its annual press conference on 12 January, Indian Army chief M.M. Naravane had mentioned that their immediate concern was terror emanating from Pakistan. Naravane, in a clear and unambiguous message to Pakistan and the world, had said that Pakistan was continuing to use terrorism as a tool for achieving its state objectives. “Pakistan continues to embrace terror and terrorism as an instrument of state policy. However, we are very clear that we have zero tolerance for terror and we reserve our right to respond at a time and place of our own choosing and with precision. This is a clear message that we have sent across that we will not tolerate any such kind of activity,” the COAS said, in what is being seen as a reiteration of India’s “aggressive” strategy to counter Pakistan’s decades old method of using non-state actors to destabilize the country.

It is pertinent to mention that Pakistan, by way of a series of steps taken in the last few months, where it has “arrested” terror chiefs, has been trying to create a global perception that it is seriously tackling jihadi terrorism. However, according to intelligence officials, the situation on the ground in PoK, where terror groups are being protected and nurtured, tells a totally different story.",Several Pak-based terror groups seeking to enter India from PoK,www.sundayguardianlive.com

Natrona County Sheriff's Office Investigations Sgt. Taylor Courtney told K2 News that there was a snowmobile accident near Ponderosa Park on Casper Mountain.

The Sheriff's Office is utilizing a vehicle known as a Hagglund to rescue any persons involved in the accident.

According to the The International Centre for Terrestrial Antarctic Research, Hagglunds were created in Sweden in 1922. They are used in heavy snow situations to transport multiple people and cargo over snow and ice. Hagglunds usually have two cabs, with the front cab used to transport up to four people, while the back cab transports additional people. A huge benefit to Hagglunds is that they are enclosed, which ensure warmth for the people inside of it. They are also able to float and move through water if necessary.

Larry Rubis, with Tracked Outdoors LLC, donated the Hagglund to the Natrona County Sheriff's Office in 2019.

It is currently unknown how many people were involved in the accident and the extent of their injuries is unknown at this time, as well.

We understand that ever since the first COVID-19 cases surfaced a year ago, people have yearned to keep their lives as normal and unfettered as possible. But anti-maskers who argue that they’re striking a blow for liberty are sadly misguided: Their refusal to don masks has worked mostly to undermine our liberty by prolonging this pandemic and making it more lethal.

That’s why we all need to bear in mind that the coronavirus vaccines now being distributed — and that must be delivered faster in coming weeks — won’t change things overnight, even for those lucky enough to get the first shots.

And an even more dangerous misunderstanding is looming: A vaccination certainly reduces the likelihood that a person will get seriously sick (and even die) from COVID, but it doesn’t necessarily make that person less likely to spread the virus to others. That’s why even those who are vaccinated should heed medical advice to continue to wear masks, keep their distance from others, wash their hands thoroughly, stay home whenever sick and so on.

“I think people really do need to understand that even if you are vaccinated you still need to adhere to the public health guidelines we’ve been talking about the last year,” says Dr. Krutika Kuppalli of the Medical University of South Carolina. “We do know the vaccine prevents you from getting sick or getting severe coronavirus disease. The data we still don’t have is whether you can become a carrier for the disease and then transmit it on to someone else. That’s what people don’t quite understand.”

Researchers are still sorting that out, and it might — might — be possible one day to say that those vaccinated are less likely to spread the virus. But that day isn’t here — and may never come.

Unfortunately, there are other misunderstandings surrounding the vaccine as well. Public health officials and all of us still have work to do to convince many of us that these new vaccines, developed in near record time, are both safe and effective.

Dr. Kuppalli worked in West Africa during the Ebola pandemic several years ago, and convincing skeptical (and misinformed) citizens to get vaccinated was a major challenge, one that involved blasting texts to people’s phones, having vans with megaphones blaring the message from village to village and more.

“I think a lot of the lessons learned with Ebola are very similar to what we’re dealing with here in this pandemic,” she says. “There is a lot of dealing with endangered populations and communicating information to populations that have had a lot of misinformation. We need to work to educate people and meet them where they are, not where we expect them to be. I think we need to do a better job at engaging community leaders and working with them to help engage the population. ... It’s very hard work.”

So the challenge facing the Biden administration and state health departments isn’t simply to acquire more vaccine doses and secure the related supplies, distribution networks and protocols to give many more shots as quickly as possible. It’s also to build trust among those who need to receive the doses. The urgency is building as new variants emerge that are even easier to spread. Fortunately, Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser for the pandemic, said the current vaccines appear to work against new variants present in the United States.

“It’s like a race against the clock, especially as we see new strains emerge as well,” Dr. Kuppalli told us. “I don’t know if there will be any one defined point where we’ll say ‘We’re done here.’ It’s going to be a lot of things we look at.”

It’s also clear that the more of us who are willing and able to get vaccinated — and the more we continue to act responsibly before and even after getting those shots — the more quickly we will be able to reach the point where it would be conceivable for our health officials to say something like, “We’re done here.”","Editorial: So you finally got your COVID vaccination?

Muscatine, IA (WQAD) — A Hy-Vee semi-truck rolling through Muscatine didn’t make a scheduled delivery, but a surprise one for a local 10-year-old. Peyton Story jumped with excitement when he found out the grocery store chain was donating free food to his pantry.

“I saw the huge semi-truck and I was wondering ‘What the heck is going on?'” Peyton says.

Inside the truck, there was more than 700 boxes of Pop-Tarts and just over 2,000 cans of corn from the Muscatine Hy-Vee.

“I’m going put them in my pantry and hold some of the boxes for spares when I do need to refill,” Peyton says.

Peyton started his food pantry at his mom’s laundromat last November, using extra birthday money to stock the shelves at first. Since then, the community has chipped in to help, raising more than $1,600 for the fourth grader’s project.

“Peyton is a bright, young little man that we wanted to help out,” Store Director Matt Schweizer says. “This is a cool thing to do at his age.”

Matt says Peyton’s mission to feed the community didn’t go unnoticed.

“I think Peyton has stirred up some attention, and I bet there are more donations to come,” he says.

Peyton’s mom Tabbi says she and Peyton have learned a lot while keeping the pantry stocked, leading up to Thursday’s surprise donation.

“This donation is something that I never, ever though would’ve happened,” she says.

Tabbi says she’s proud of her son, helping a few local families with personal shopping trips and looking forward to his new goal.

“He amazes me every day, every single day,” she says.

Peyton hopes to take his mission right to those who need it most.

“Now I’m going to go to homeless shelters and churches,” he says.

458,459,https://vietnamnet.vn/en/business/exporters-to-identify-risks-of-trade-defence-measures-in-the-us-707855.html,"especially the US, which tended to increase trade defence measures.

Experts from the Trade and Investment Promotion Center of HCM City (ITPC) mentioned the matter at a seminar on legal issues when exporting to the US market in the city on January 21.

Tran Phu Lu, deputy director of ITPC said: “Viet Nam has participated in many Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), creating conditions for export goods to enjoy preferential tariffs, improving the competitiveness capacity and export turnover. However, a number of investigations and trade protection measures for local products also increased.”

According to statistics of the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT), by the end of 2020, it recorded and handled 193 cases of foreign trade defence on Vietnamese goods, including 108 anti-dumping cases, 22 countervailing cases, 23 tax evasion cases and 40 self-defence cases. So far, Vietnamese export goods have been investigated for trade defence with the affected turnover of up to US$12 billion.

There were 32 initiations of investigations recorded last year, doubling the figure in 2019. The majority of goods subject to trade defence investigations included metals, fibers, and aquatic products, plywood, building materials and chemicals, which were known as the country’s advantages.

The markets that regularly investigate trade remedies for Viet Nam's exports included the US, India, EU, Turkey, Canada and Australia, which accounted for 62 per cent of the trade remedies cases on Vietnamese exports, said MoIT.

It added ASEAN countries were also actively investigating trade remedies with 38 cases, or 20 per cent of the total cases.

Director Lu said: “The US is one of the leading economic and trade partners and the largest export market of Viet Nam. However, with a complicated and regulated legal system, it always has many potential risks for Vietnamese exporters. Every year, the number of imported consignments from Viet Nam which are sued and ordered to be destroyed or returned from the market is increasing.”

“In addition, many key export commodities of Viet Nam easily fall into the sights of investigating trade defence suits, creating difficulties and challenges for Vietnamese businesses, as a result, they are required to pay attention to information when they want to boost their exports to the US market,” said Lu.

C. Matthew, Attorney at Dentons International Law Firm, told the seminar: “The US is a large consumer market and a trading partner that many countries want to penetrate. However, this is also a market with lots of potential legal risks, especially the increase of trade remedies in recent times. The US will adjust different trade policies to protect the interests of the nation in different phases with different partners.”

Matthew said the US tended to increase supervision with commodities and countries with large trade surpluses, which increase abnormally and rapidly in a short period of time and pay special attention to the issue of the true origin of goods.

Matthew said due to favourable conditions such as the attraction of foreign investment leading to increased export production, taking advantage of supply chain disruptions and gaps in the US market, Viet Nam has more chance to enter the market. However, he added the excessive increase in turnover of some products would make them face the risk of lawsuits and trade remedies. If tax is imposed on a product, it could affect the whole industry and make many others leave the market because the US trade defence tax rate was often very high.

Diep Quoc Ke, CEO of ASIA Golden Link INC, recommended: ""Prevention is better than cure,"" suggesting exporters identify risks to avoid investigations or cases on trade remedies, especially for the US market.

Ke said the businesses must understand the US legal system and the federal law as there were separate laws for each state, adding it was important to understand trading partners to avoid high-risk transactions.

Experts also emphasised enterprises importing raw materials or semi-finished products from a third country to process then export to the US needed to pay special attention to the history of the trade of such goods between the United States and the third country and not use raw materials and products that the US was applying trade remedies for export or all products of Viet Nam will be subject to the same commercial defence measures.

Instead, Vietnamese businesses should learn and boost the import of raw materials and goods from the US to serve local production and consumption. — VNS",Exporters to identify risks of trade defence measures in the US,vietnamnet.vn
459,460,https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Justice-Department-FBI-debate-not-charging-some-15892872.php,"Justice Department, FBI debate not charging some of the Capitol rioters

WASHINGTON - Federal law enforcement officials are privately debating whether they should decline to charge some of the individuals who stormed the U.S. Capitol this month - a politically loaded proposition but one alert to the practical concern that hundreds of such cases could swamp the local courthouse.

The internal discussions are in their early stages, and no decisions have been reached about whether to forgo charging some of those who illegally entered the Capitol on Jan. 6, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions.

Justice Department officials have promised a relentless effort to identify and arrest those who stormed the Capitol that day, but internally there is robust back-and-forth about whether charging them all is the best course of action. That debate comes at a time when officials are keenly sensitive that the credibility of the Justice Department and the FBI are at stake in such decisions, given the apparent security and intelligence failures that preceded the riot, these people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss legal deliberations.

Federal officials estimate that roughly 800 people surged into the building, though they caution that such numbers are imprecise, and the real figure could be 100 people or more in either direction.

Among those roughly 800 people, FBI agents and prosecutors have so far seen a broad mix of behavior - from people dressed for military battle, moving in formation, to wanton vandalism, to simply going with the crowd into the building.

Due to the wide variety of behavior, some federal officials have argued internally that those people who are known only to have committed unlawful entry - and were not engaged in violent, threatening or destructive behavior - should not be charged, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Other agents and prosecutors have pushed back against that suggestion, arguing that it is important to send a forceful message that the kind of political violence and mayhem on display Jan. 6 needs to be punished to the full extent of the law, so as to discourage similar conduct in the future.

There are a host of other factors complicating the discussions, many of which center not around the politics of the riot, but the real-world work of investigators and prosecutors, these people said.

The Justice Department has already charged more than 135 individuals with committing crimes in or around the Capitol building, and many more are expected to be charged in the coming weeks and months. By mid-January, the FBI had already received more than 200,000 tips from the public about the riot, in addition to news footage and police officer testimony.

""There is absolute resolve from the Department of Justice to hold all who intentionally engaged in criminal acts at the Capitol accountable,"" Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi said in an email. ""We have consistently made clear that we will follow the facts and evidence and charge individuals accordingly. We remain confident that the U.S. District Court for Washington, DC can appropriately handle the docket related to any resulting charges.""

The primary objective for authorities is to determine which individuals, if any, planned, orchestrated or directed the violence. To that end, the FBI has already found worrying linkages within such extremist groups as the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters, and is looking to see if those groups coordinated with each other to storm the building, according to people familiar with the investigation.

Prosecutors have signaled they are looking to bring charges of seditious conspiracy against anyone who planned and carried out violence aimed at the government - a charge that carries a maximum possible prison sentence of 20 years.

But even as Justice Department officials look to bring those types of cases, they privately acknowledge those more determined and dangerous individuals may have operated within a broader sea of people who rushed through the doors but didn't do much else, and prosecutors will ultimately have to decide if all of those lesser offenders should be charged.

Officials insisted they are not under pressure in regards to timing of decisions about how to handle those type of cases. For one thing, investigators are still gathering evidence, and agents could easily turn up additional photos or online postings that show a person they initially believed was harmless had, in fact, encouraged or engaged in other crimes.

Investigators also expect that some of those charged in the riot will eventually cooperate and provide evidence against others, and that could change their understanding of what certain people said or did that day, these people said.

Nevertheless, these people said, some in federal law enforcement are concerned that charging people solely with unlawful entry, when they are not known to have committed any other bad acts, could lead to losses if they go to trial.

""If an old man says all he did was walk in and no one tried to stop him, and he walked out and no one tried to stop him, and that's all we know about what he did, that's a case we may not win,"" one official said.

Another official noted most of those arrested so far have no criminal records.

Meanwhile, defense lawyers for some of those charged are contemplating something akin to a ""Trump defense"" - that the president or other authority figures gave them permission or invited them to commit an otherwise illegal act.

""If you think of yourself as a soldier doing the bidding of the commander in chief, you don't try to hide your actions. You assume you will be held up as a hero by the nation,"" criminal defense lawyers Teri Kanefield and Mark Reichel wrote last week.

Such a defense might not forestall charges but could be effective at trial or sentencing. Trump's looming impeachment trial in the Senate will also focus further attention on his actions and raise questions about the culpability of followers for the misinformation spread by leaders around bogus election-fraud claims rejected by courts and state voting officials.

""It's not a like a bunch of people gathered on their own and decided to do this, it's not like a mob. It's people who were asked to come by the president, encouraged to come by the president, and encouraged to do what they did by the president and a number of others,"" said one attorney representing defendants charged in the breach who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss legal strategy.

Prosecutors have other options. For rioters with no previous criminal records or convictions and whose known behavior inside the Capitol was not violent or destructive, the government could enter into deferred plea agreements, a diversion program akin to pretrial probation in which prosecutors agree to drop charges if a defendant commits no offenses over a certain time period.

Such a resolution would not result in even a misdemeanor conviction, and has been used before in some cases involving individuals with a history of mental illness who were arrested for jumping the White House fence. Criminal defense attorneys note there may be further distinctions between individuals who may have witnessed illegal activity or otherwise had reason to know they were entering a restricted area, and those for whom prosecutors can't show such awareness.

There is also a question over whether charging all of the rioters could swamp the federal court system. In 2019, D.C. federal courts recorded only about 430 criminal cases, and fewer than 300 last year, when the legal system slowed significantly due to the pandemic. Many of those cases, however, had multiple defendants.

The workload of prosecuting the rioters could be eased if some of the cases were farmed out to other U.S. attorney offices around the country, but so far D.C. prosecutors have shown no interest in doing so. The law generally requires that individuals be prosecuted in the district in which a crime occurred.

""The crime happened here. Prosecutors and judges can see the crime scene from their office windows. I find it strange anyone would suggest it be done anywhere else,"" a person familiar with the investigation said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss an internal debate.

Beyond all the evidence-gathering and charging decisions left to do, federal officials concede there will likely be some number of people who were there that day and are simply never identified, due to some combination of luck, masks or lack of social media posts.

Kary told Daily Mail that she tried to forgive and make amends with LeeAnne after the controversial insults LeeAnne swung at her during Season 4.

“We did go to lunch and she did apologize, and I told her, ‘I appreciate it and I wish you would’ve apologized a lot sooner,'” Kary said of LeeAnne’s apology.

However, it seems like the peace between the two did not last for long.

LeeAnne reportedly wasn’t thrilled that Kary condemned her behavior last season during a recent RHOD episode.

Kary explained that she received a text from LeeAnne following the episode.

“I feel like I forgive and forget, she apologized. But it was actually when this last episode showed and I made the comparison, and she texted me she was disappointed,” Kary explained.

Kary then revealed that LeeAnne should’ve reflected on her behavior rather than attack her again.

“And I was like, ‘What?’ Maybe you say, ‘Kary, I’m sorry again,'” she told the outlet. “But anyways, that’s LeeAnne, so…”

To LeeAnne’s credit, Kary did directly reference her in the episode after being prompted by the producers.

During a confessional interview, Kary was asked to compare the racist video Brandi Redmond made, which Kary has defended, to the racist names LeeAnne called her during the prior season.

“The difference between what LeeAnne did and what Brandi did in the video, LeeAnne was doing it out of hate,” Kary explained.

“Brandi’s video was very ignorant and stupid, but she’s been so devastated about it and I think that she will never do something like that again,” she continued before adding, “Sadly, I never saw that from LeeAnne.”

LeeAnne received severe backlash after she referred to Kary as “the Mexican” numerous times.

She even called her the “chirpy Mexican.”

During the reunion, LeeAnne attempted to apologize, but her castmates had little remorse for her.

Gov. Tim Walz issued Executive Order 20-99 on Nov. 18, 2020. The executive order prohibited bars and restaurants from offering on-premises dining. The executive order was issued at a time of rapid acceleration in the spread of COVID-19 across Minnesota and sought to protect Minnesotans while also preventing hospitals and health care systems from becoming overwhelmed by the surge in cases.

According to MDH, in December, the establishment announced in a social media post that it was open and welcoming customers to come in for food and drinks. Photos of customers eating and drinking in violation of the executive order were published on social media and in the news. MDH issued a cease-and-desist order and license suspension notice.

Since then, MDH staff found in follow-up inspections that the establishment continued to operate in violation of these notices and regulatory actions.

“The vast majority of businesses are doing their best to help slow down the spread of COVID-19,” said Huff. “Establishments who operated in defiance do not get a free pass.

Prosecutors asked a judge on Friday (Jan 22) to keep the man, Garret Miller, in jail ahead of a court appearance, according to court records. They revealed five criminal charges in the US District Court of the District of Columbia against Miller on Wednesday, including for making death threats and trespassing offences.

Images of social media posts allegedly authored by Miller, which appear to announce his trip to the Capitol and threaten the life of Ocasio-Cortez as well as a Capitol Police officer, are cited in the court filing.

Prosecutors said Miller made numerous threatening remarks online, including one instance in which he commented ""next time we bring the guns"" on a Twitter video showing rioters exiting a Capitol building.

As rioters broke into the Capitol, Ocasio-Cortez worried her own colleagues in Congress might divulge her location to the mob, putting her at risk for kidnapping or worse, according to an Instagram Live video she recorded on Jan 12.

Ocasio-Cortez also said that she experienced ""a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die"" on Jan 6, adding that she could not get into specifics for security reasons, according to a Washington Post account of the video.

466,467,https://www.pressherald.com/2021/01/23/aloha-shirts-on-boogaloos-link-symbol-of-peace-to-violence/,"HONOLULU — People following a violent movement that promotes a second U.S. civil war or the breakdown of modern society have been showing up at recent protests across the nation armed and wearing tactical gear. But the anti-government “boogaloo” movement has adopted an unlikely public and online symbol: the so-called Hawaiian shirt.

The often brightly colored, island-themed garment, known in Hawaii as an aloha shirt, is to people across the world synonymous with a laid back lifestyle. But in Hawaii, it has an association with aloha — the Native Hawaiian spirit of love, compassion and mercy.

The shirts are being worn by militant followers of the boogaloo philosophy – the antithesis of aloha – at demonstrations about coronavirus lockdowns, racial injustice and, most recently, the presidential election.

Boogaloo is a loosely affiliated far-right movement that includes a variety of extremist factions and political views. The name is a reference to a slang term for a sequel – in this case, a second civil war.

“You have everyone from neo-Nazis and white nationalists to libertarians,” said Cassie Miller, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups in the U.S. “And while ideologically there might be some differentiation among people who identify with the movement, what unites them is their interest in having complete access to firearms and the belief that the country is heading towards a civil war.”

Miller said those who follow boogaloo, sometimes referred to as “Boogaloo Bois,” believe that “people need to rise up against the government, which they see as tyrannical and essentially irredeemable, and that the only solution to righting what they see as their perceived grievances is to overthrow the state.”

Those adhering to the philosophy often target law enforcement, Miller said, because the police are the most accessible symbol of the government at public gatherings.

People affiliated with the movement have been linked to real-world violence, including a string of domestic terrorism plots. The movement has also been promoted by white supremacists, but many supporters insist they’re not truly advocating for violence. Attempts by The Associated Press to reach people associated with the movement were unsuccessful.

“If you look at their online spaces, their rhetoric is extremely violent,” Miller said. “A lot of it is kind of under this veneer of irony and humor, but there’s something very real to all of it.”

When social media sites began banning the use of the word “boogaloo” and those associated with the movement, followers started using different terms to mask their online identities and intentions.

“They’ll adopt a slogan that sounds benign in order to evade scrutiny, in order to evade bans. And so with the boogaloo, what you got is sort of variations of that term showing up in online spaces,” Miller said. “One of them was ‘big luau,’ and that is then what led to using Hawaiian imagery and then the Hawaiian shirts.”

Miller added that she doesn’t believe “they’re really thinking about the meaning of the symbols that they’re using.”

“For them, it’s a reference to show that they’re in the know that they’re part of this culture, that they can identify each other at public gatherings like this. And I think that’s really how it functions. It is creating kind of a sense of camaraderie.”

But to those who live in Hawaii, especially Native Hawaiians, the aloha spirit attached to the commercialized patterns on the shirts has deeper meaning.

“The aloha shirt is one thing but aloha itself is another, and the principles of aloha are deeply rooted in our culture,” said Kealoha Pisciotta, a Native Hawaiian activist who has led peaceful protests against the building of a telescope on a Hawaii peak indigenous people consider sacred. “The principles of aloha are based on love, peace, harmony, truth.”

“It creates the space for compassion to come into our heart, rather than the contrary of that, which would be hate, loathing, anti-Semitism, you know, racism,” Pisciotta said.

Many Native Hawaiians share a sense of frustration with U.S. and state government because of the way the Hawaiian Kingdom was overthrown. They have long fought against the exploitation and commercialization of their land by large corporations and government entities, but in a mostly peaceful way.

“Hawaiians are facing desecration of our burials … of our sacred places. But it’s in our choice of how we want to respond and address the powers that be,” Pisciotta added. “If you want the end result to be based in peace, then you have to move in peace and move in aloha.”

“Aloha is about also reducing suffering, reducing, deescalating anger,” she added. “It’s human to become angry, it’s human to feel frustrated. It’s human to want to lash out. But but it’s also human to find compassion.”

Dale Hope, whose parents owned a garment factory in Honolulu that he went on to run and create quality aloha shirts with an eye toward detailed and authentic Hawaiian imagery, said the imagery being used at protests among extremists is misguided.

“I don’t think they really understand the value and the meaning of what these shirts represent,” he said. “I think they’re an easy way for them to stand out in the crowd and to get a lot of attention. But I don’t I don’t think they have a clue as to what the meaning and the virtues of aloha are with love and compassion and sharing.”

Hope wrote the book “The Aloha Shirt” about the early days of the textile industry in Hawaii and the meaning behind the aloha symbolism.

Aloha shirts first emerged in Hawaii in the 1930s and became accepted business wear locally in the 1960s.

They often feature island motifs such as native plants, ocean waves and other scenes that play a prominent role in Native Hawaiian legends and hula chants. Some also show Chinese calligraphy or Japanese carp, reflecting the many cultures that have shaped modern Hawaii.

Hope said some designers in Hawaii go out and chant and ask Hawaiian gods for respect before they begin the process of making the symbols on the shirts.

“We’ve always tried to do things with respect and honor, whatever the subject is that we’re trying to portray on a piece of textile,” Hope said. “I think the aloha shirt is a representation of your passion and your love for this wonderful place that we call home. Hawaii is a unique, wonderful group of islands out in the middle of the Pacific.”",Aloha shirts on ‘boogaloos’ link symbol of peace to violence,www.pressherald.com

His efforts to lure her to his palace of pleasure ultimately fail, and The Lady, by her steadfastness to right reason, is at last freed by her good discipline.

While “Comus” never made the headlines like “Paradise Lost,” it deserves to be remembered, and even taught in our schools and colleges.

I’ve been thinking of Comus as the courts sort out questions about a North Carolina charter school’s decision to require its ninth-grade language arts students to read “The Poet X” by Elizabeth Acevedo. Not because of how much “The Poet X” reminds me of Comus, but because of how much it doesn’t.

Acevedo tells the story of a young Harlem girl who uses slam poetry basically to slam her mother’s Christian faith. Filled with profanity, the story is explicit and explicitly blasphemous. And this is what at least one school decided our young people need to be reading: a book trashing Judeo-Christian values.

Our time is certainly out of joint. We have lost that one ingredient to good living: virtue.

There. I said it. Out loud. I’m sure I’ll be called a scold by my kindest critics, but it needs to be said. I don’t mean by virtue one of the well-known seven, although those are worth remembering (humility, modesty, diligence, patience, kindness, temperance and charity) — and Lord knows we need them in surfeit today.

What I mean by virtue is what it meant from its beginning: moral excellence. One could say that to be virtuous is to follow all seven of those heavenly virtues.

Our culture, it seems, has rather adopted the seven deadly sins instead (just for review: envy, lust, pride, greed, wrath, gluttony, sloth).

C.S. Lewis once wrote, “We mock honor and wonder why we have traitors in our midst.” I amend that only slightly: We mock virtue and wonder why we are awash in vulgarity.

It’s hard to get away from the vulgarity and even harder to resist. When forced to hear such things, even the most delicate among us loses respect for humanity, as Cicero reminds us. It ruins our politics, our theater, even our common conversations.

Among nearly everyone, the F-word is a comma or an adjective. It shows up in the casual conversation of young and old. It’s on T-shirts and all over social media. Stand-up comics cannot tell a joke without using the word ad nauseam, and apparently moms and dads cannot even correct their children without it, which, by the way, is often why their children use it so frequently.

This is to say nothing for the rest of our four-letter vocabularies, let alone their behaviors. But saying these words isn’t the only problem. As we like to say today, it’s systemic in our natures now. When it isn’t the words, it’s the sexualization of everything: clothes, ads, television shows, radio and everything else. The internet is awash with it, and I don’t just mean porn sites. Patience is gone, humility something we think others should have, greed an ambition, diligence thought to be elitist, kindness something you show to animals and modesty sexist.

So I’ll be a scold, and everyone can tell me to, well, you know, that “off” phrase. I hope for some, however, it will be a quiet clarion call to better living in 2021.

469,470,https://www.wvlkam.com/news/texas-case-against-biden-hinges-on-legality-of-last-minute-deal/,"The Department of Homeland Security, 12 days before President Joe Biden was sworn in, struck a “binding” deal with Texas agreeing to consult with the state for 180 days before making changes to immigration policy, effectively tying the hands of the new administration.

That Jan. 8 accord between Texas Governor Greg Abbott and then-acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Kenneth Cuccinelli is at the center of the first major lawsuit against the Biden administration.

On Friday, the state accused the federal government of violating the deal by planning a 100-day pause on deportations without first giving Texas a chance to object.

“Texas faces irreparable harm from having to provide costly educational, social, welfare, health care, and other services to illegal aliens who remain in Texas because Defendants have ceased removing them,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in the state’s filing.

U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton in Victoria, Texas, heard arguments Friday on Paxton’s request for a temporary restraining order against the plan while the case proceeds. Tipton, a Donald Trump appointee, said he’d rule soon.

The Justice Department argues the state is trying to usurp the federal government’s authority over immigration in its last-ditch deal with the Trump administration. Later Friday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a brief siding with the Biden administration, calling the effort by Texas an illegal attempt to block the government’s exercise of its discretion on the removal of immigrants.

“Approving this agreement would set a deeply problematic precedent,” the ACLU said in its friend-of-the-court brief. “If an outgoing DHS official can sign away the next administration’s policy-making authority for six months, why not for four years? Or eight?”

The rights organization said that giving any credence to the agreement, even temporarily, would pave the way for similar last-minute deals between agencies and states — or even outside parties — as presidents depart.

“Our Constitution directs that presidential elections occur every four years, with the Executive authority transferring shortly thereafter,” the ACLU said. “But on Texas’s view, an outgoing administration need never yield power so long as it finds a willing contractor to lock in its policy preferences.”

Texas said in its motion for a restraining order that its deal with the Trump administration was “mutually beneficial” and was reached to promote “cooperation and coordination.” The state argues it has a unique exposure to immigration issues because of its long border with Mexico, and therefore deserves to have input on immigration changes.",Texas Case Against Biden Hinges on Legality of Last-Minute Deal,www.wvlkam.com

""We are willing to walk a new path in our relations with Joe Biden's government based on mutual respect, dialogue, communication and understanding,"" the leftist leader told supporters, adding that he ""is willing to turn the page"" with the new US administration.

The Trump administration had slapped multiple economic sanctions on Venezuela, including an oil embargo in place since 2019, in an attempt to overthrow the socialist regime of Maduro, whom the US has labeled a dictator.

After years of a frosty relationship Caracas and Washington fully broke diplomatic ties on January 23, 2019, when the US government recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president.

After Biden won the US presidential election in November, Maduro congratulated the longtime politician saying Venezuela was ""ready for dialogue and good understanding with the people and government of the United States,"" repeating those sentiments again in December.

Analysts believe the Biden administration will take a more moderate stance on Venezuela and will support international mediation for the transition towards a new government.

MDH revoked Alibi's license to operate as a food and beverage service establishment 20 days after an initial warning on Dec. 22 after the restaurant continued to offer on-premises dining against Gov. Tim Walz's Nov. 18 executive order, according to MDH.

""We do not take enforcement actions lightly,"" Assistant Commissioner Dan Huff said in a Saturday statement. ""Even when there is no pandemic, the public depends upon the licensing of bars and restaurants as a basic public health measure – which is why the legislature requires that bars and restaurants have an active license in order to serve the public.""

Walz issued order 20-99 barring restaurants and bars from offering on-premises dining when COVID-19 cases in Minnesota were spiking ahead of the holidays and has since eased restrictions as case numbers begin to fall slightly.

Alibi's license expired on Dec. 31, and it has continued to operate without a license against state law, which prompted the lawsuit. The restaurant did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News.

Lisa Monet Zarza, the co-owner of Alibi Drinker, on Jan. 8 posted a video to the restaurant's Facebook page condemning the Jan. 6 Capitol riots but went on to say ""the general consensus is that Americans are fed up.""

""We're fed up with the government trying to control our actions. They're fed up with the hatred that's going on from both sides. They're fed up with the pain that people are feeling because they're not being heard,"" Monet said, adding that she thinks the events at the Capitol were ""a pretty strong indication of where our country's going.""

Monet continued to say in the video that a Dakota County judge had ruled on Jan. 7 that the state could fine Alibi $3,000 per day for every day that the restaurant remains open, calling the governor's executive order ""unconstitutional"" and saying she was initially prepared to spend the money to keep her bar open.

""He's being pressured by...the attorney general. He's being pressured by Walz to make decisions to make us comply. It's really hard for me to stand down because we've been fighting this fight for how many weeks now?"" Monet said. ""...I hope that the fight that we took is a fight that helped every single bar and restaurant, and every employee, in the state to...be able to open.""

Huff said that establishments operating in defiance of the state ""do not get a free pass.""

""The vast majority of businesses are doing their best to help slow down the spread of COVID-19,"" Huff said. ""Establishments who [sic] operated in defiance do not get a free pass. Thousands of other bars and restaurants made sacrifices for the protection of our public health, and we are grateful for their cooperation and selflessness.""

MDH reported 1,565 new COVID-19 cases and 31 deaths Saturday -- down significantly from highs of more than 7,000 cases per day reported in November.

MANDATORY LOCKDOWNS MAY NOT BE BETTER AT CONTROLLING COVID-19 THAN LESS RESTRICTIVE MEASURES, STUDY FINDS

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on Friday announced that he had reached a settlement with two restaurants that violated state COVID-19 restrictions last year, according to WCCO. If the restaurants violate the settlement, they could face penalties of up to $25,000 each.

Similar disputes between state governments and business owners are happening throughout the country.

In Staten Island, for example, a bar called Mac's Public House was stripped of its liquor license and formally shut down in early December after its co-owner, Danny Presti, was arrested on charges of unauthorized food and beverage service.

Presti and co-owner Keith McAlarney served patrons indoors against state orders and after a 10 p.m. curfew imposed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

A person familiar with the suspension told Fox News in late December that the bar was facing multiple charges, each of which carries a maximum fine of up to $10,000 and revocation or cancellation of the bar's liquor license, but no one associated with Mac's pub had scheduled a hearing to challenge the SLA's decision at that time.

""Mac's Pub, its owners, attorneys, and staff members have been harassed, intimidated, fined, and arrested. They have been hit with over $40,000 in fines and criminal summonses, all under illicit enforcement by NYC Sheriffs,"" lawyers for the pub said in a Dec. 30 statement.

The site was shut down after a 34-year-old Queensland man was arrested by German police last week near the German border with Denmark.

He is accused of being the administrator of DarkMarket, which was selling drugs, counterfeit cash, stolen credit card data, anonymous SIM cards and malware.

It set off a wave of alarm. The Alberta government worked through the weekend to prepare its response strategy and a flurry of phone calls were placed between Ottawa, representatives in Washington and to the TC Energy headquarters in Calgary. On Sunday, news outlets reported on a Biden team transition memo that said the death of Keystone XL was coming. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Inside Alberta's very bad week: A behind-the-scenes look at the killing of Keystone XL A senior Alberta government source said there was a “lot of anger” within the premier’s office, given they had been hoping Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — who spoke with Biden in November — was going to at least be able to keep Biden from scuttling the project until further discussions were held, even though he’d promised to kill it in May 2020. “It felt like a betrayal,” the source said. The impression that there would be discussions going forward was mistaken. And no one was prepared for the pipeline to be cancelled on Biden’s first day. Kenney placed anxious calls to federal ministers, U.S. congressmen, American labour unions, and, on Tuesday, the day before the inauguration, the premier and James Rajotte, Alberta’s envoy to the United States, had a phone call with Trudeau.

Rajotte, said the Alberta government source, told Trudeau “union groups told him that only a phone call from Trudeau to Biden could salvage the project.” “The PM did not acknowledge the request to call,” the source said. The Prime Minister’s Office declined to comment on the specifics of the phone call between Kenney and Rajotte and Trudeau, and referred the National Post to previous statements Trudeau has made about the pipeline. Kirsten Hillman, Canada’s Ambassador to the United States, was notified of the decision on Tuesday night before the inauguration and executive order signing the next day. On Wednesday, within hours of being sworn in as president, Biden signed an executive order that revoked the presidential permit Trump had issued for the US$14.4-billion pipeline that would link Alberta’s crude oil production with heavy oil refineries in Texas and Louisiana. Since then, it’s been tools down for thousands of workers, many of them members of massive American labour unions.

“This is an approach that President Biden has been signalling for some time,” de Jong said. His organization supported the pipeline. Still, within the energy industry, executives were hopeful that a negotiation on the merits of the project was possible. “Up until the pen hit the paper, there was some hope that there would be some conditions around it or some ability to negotiate and engage,” said Chris Bloomer, president and CEO of the Canadian Energy Pipelines Association, an industry group representing midstream companies — TC Energy is a member. “I have to believe that the governments, both federally and provincially, engaged in sincere conversations about this and tried to find a way through, but this has evolved to be such a powerful political symbol, that I think that trumped everything.”

A federal government official described the effort to advocate in Washington for the project as a “Team Canada” approach between Alberta and Ottawa. The team attempted to sell the merits of the project: built with union labour, partly owned by Canadian and U.S. Indigenous groups, and powered by renewable energy. It also pitched Canada as being committed to emissions reductions and a carbon tax. Throughout last fall, Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage, federal Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan, and Rajotte held weekly calls to strategize on how to make the case for Keystone XL in the U.S. halls of power. The Alberta government had also ramped up its lobbying. Alberta’s trade office in Washington held more than 60 meetings with politicians and staff — mostly Democrats and “Biden influencers.”

In December, Alberta added two Washington lobby firms, JDA Frontline Inc. and Crossroads Strategies, to its roster (a contract with Crestview Strategy was already in place) to press the case for Keystone XL, the Alberta energy sector broadly and other economic issues in Washington. But the efforts made over the last half of 2020 were too little, too late, sources said. The project was doomed. There were also several missteps during the Trump years that made it less likely the project would survive an incoming Democratic president looking to appease the environmental wing of his party. “It would have made no difference. I lived all this,” said Dennis McConaghy, a former TC Energy executive who oversaw the Keystone XL pipeline project under the Obama administration before his retirement in 2016. “There was no one you could have hired that was going to change the minds of the people around Biden.”

The “Team Canada” strategy has now taken on a new dimension. Kenney has demanded that Ottawa take a more assertive approach in an attempt to negotiate for Keystone XL and, if that fails, to retaliate with sanctions. Other premiers, it seems, share his concern. This has evolved to be such a powerful political symbol, that I think that trumped everything On a Thursday evening phone call with Trudeau, Quebec Premier François Legault, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe all expressed dismay, said an Alberta government source with knowledge of the call. Canada meekly accepting the death of KXL sets an alarming precedent for the country, which faces the possibility of the Biden administration also invoking Buy American provisions in federal projects. The Alberta source told the National Post that Kenney had made this case to Trudeau on the Tuesday phone call, and that Trudeau agreed, and said that would be his message in the coming days to Biden. He was to speak with the new president on Friday.

“The PM’s rather muted response the next day seemed to very much contradict both publicly and to us privately about how Keystone was a top priority. It told us all we needed to know about where we stood,” the source said. Wednesday marked the third time a U.S. president has killed the project, which was first proposed in 2008 and has spent more than a decade in regulatory reviews and endless litigation. Former U.S. president Barack Obama vetoed Keystone back in 2012 and, after the company re-applied for permits at the president’s own invitation, denied the project permits again in 2015. A senior company source, who has since left TC Energy, but who has direct knowledge of the matter, said the U.S. administration gave the company, then called TransCanada Corp., one hour’s notice of the impending cancellation at that time. The company’s then-president and CEO Russ Girling looked liked he was in shock after getting notice of the veto in 2012, the source said.

But the source said the company made strategic mistakes in its third attempt to get the project built after former U.S. president Donald Trump signed an executive order reviving the pipeline on Jan. 24, 2017. They did not communicate the merits of the project assertively with opponents, and most importantly, did not leverage relationships with major U.S. trade unions. “They (trade unions) were the only ones that could have put enough pressure on the Democrats to stop this from happening,” the person said, noting that labour marches in Washington or other demonstrations of support had been effective in garnering support for the project in the past. And, for years, TC Energy had only one government-relations contact in Washington, D.C., meaning the company was understaffed in the very place where it most needed support for its key growth project.

TC Energy did not respond to requests for comment. The company has already announced it will take a sizeable charge on its balance sheet as a result of the cancellation. Research from BMO Capital Markets shows that TC Energy had spent US$1.7 billion on the project up to the end of September 2020, but $720 million of that was contributed by investments from the government of Alberta. For the Alberta government, the project has long been a must-build, as it would have connected North America’s largest heavy oil formation, the oilsands, with the world’s largest concentration of heavy oil refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The province first began discussing the possibility of a loan guarantee for the Keystone XL project in June 2019 in an effort to drive the project forward. In the end, the province invested $1.5 billion directly in the project to give itself an ownership stake and also to finance 80 per cent of the first year of construction. It also agreed to a $6 billion loan guarantee that would have been used for construction costs this year.

It’s most likely that this project is over at least as long as Joe Biden is president The opposition New Democrats have called for a release of all the details contained in the contracts between the government and the pipeline giant. The governing UCP, meanwhile, has been pressing Ottawa to do more. On Thursday evening, Kenney sent a letter to Trudeau expressing his concerns about the cancellation of the project and called upon “the government of Canada to press the U.S. Administration to compensate TC Energy, and the Government of Alberta” for the money spent on the project. Now, the Alberta government and TC Energy are left with a pipe to nowhere. Parts of the line are built through Alberta and Saskatchewan as well as across the Saskatchewan/Montana border. McConaghy, the former TC Energy executive, said the business case for Keystone XL is actually expected to strengthen in the coming years in the U.S., because refineries in Texas and Louisiana are designed to process heavy crude, and the output from other sources, like Venezuela and Mexico, are declining. But, the business case aside, what could spell the final death — or another rebirth — is who is in the Oval Office four years from now. “It think it’s most likely that this project is over at least as long as Joe Biden is president,” McConaghy said.",Inside Alberta's very bad week: A behind-the-scenes look at the killing of Keystone XL,montrealgazette.com

484,485,https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/baba-yaga-introduces-with-a-virtual-reality-movie-premiere/2511300/,"Last week Daisy Ridley and Jennifer Hudson went to a movie premiere together. They posed for photos and made remarks from a stage while an audience watched quietly.

Or, more accurately, their avatars did.

The actors were actually on different continents, brought together for a few minutes through virtual reality headsets to walk a red carpet, pose for photos in front of a step and repeat and to speak to a crowd of other avatars on behalf of their short film “Baba Yaga.” It’s being called the first ever VR movie premiere.

“I truly feel like I went to a premiere,” Hudson said later. “But I didn’t leave home! I think it’s a cool way to do it, especially right now.”

She especially liked seeing her team and how much their avatars looked like themselves.

Virtual movie premieres have become standard in Hollywood since the pandemic started. The “events” typically just involve a start time for the film to broadcast on your home screen and, sometimes, a zoom-style Q&A with talent afterward. But Baobab Studios, the 6-year-old interactive animation studio behind a handful of cinematic VR experiences, decided to push the envelope for “Baba Yaga.”

“I really don’t think we would have ever thought of this if it wasn’t for COVID,” said Eric Darnell, the man behind the “Madagascar” films and co-founder of Baobab. “We usually have our films premiere at festivals.”

“Baba Yaga” actually got a real festival premiere too as part of the Venice Film Festival last year. But as it became increasingly clear that there would not be an opportunity stateside, the company started working alongside the XR consultancy firm MESH to produce the ambitious event, which included designing a rainforest room inspired by the one in the film.

The virtual reality movie premiere is not entirely dissimilar to an actual premiere. There are publicists, filmmakers and actors, things to look at and displays to take selfies with (really). At this particular event, there was also a roped off “restricted” area, although organizers said it was simply there to designate the end of space and not an exclusive side party.

And not unlike at actual events, sometimes you find yourself without anyone to talk to and just awkwardly wander around eavesdropping. But at a virtual reality premiere you can’t even pretend to send text messages or respond to emails. This reporter also had to take off her headset for a few minutes after getting VR dizzy.

Darnell co-wrote and directed the film/experience alongside Mathias Chelebourg. It also features the voices of Kate Winslet and Glen Close. The film and the rainforest room are currently available to experience through Oculus Quest.

Events like this may have been born out of necessity, but they could be the way of the future.

“Even if we did go back to premiering at festivals, I still think this is an amazing way to bring people together and to say let’s celebrate this medium by actually having a party inside of it,” Darnell said.",‘Baba Yaga' Introduced With a Virtual Reality Movie Premiere,www.nbclosangeles.com

• Washington struck a deal with the Taliban last year, to begin withdrawing its troops in return for security guarantees from militants.
• Biden administration officials have decided to review the pact as violence surges across Afghanistan.
• Afghanistan's acting minister of state for peace says the outcome of the review should be a truce to end attacks.

Top Afghan officials on Saturday welcomed the Biden administration's decision to review a landmark US deal with the Taliban and focus on whether the insurgents have reduced attacks in Afghanistan in keeping with the agreement.

Washington struck a deal with the Taliban in Qatar last year, to begin withdrawing its troops in return for security guarantees from the militants and a commitment to kickstart peace talks with the Afghan government.

But Biden administration officials are to re-evaluate the pact as violence across Afghanistan has surged despite the Taliban and Afghan government engaging in those talks since September in the Qatari capital of Doha.

Afghanistan's acting minister of state for peace said the outcome of the review should be a truce to end attacks in the war-ravaged country.

It is expected the review will lead ""to the demand of the Afghan people, which is an immediate stop to violence and achieving permanent peace"", Abdullah Khenjani said in a video statement Saturday.

President Joe Biden's newly appointed national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, spoke with his Afghan counterpart Hamdullah Mohib and ""made clear the United States' intention to review"" the deal, said National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne late Friday.

Washington wants to check that the Taliban is ""living up to its commitments to cut ties with terrorist groups, to reduce violence in Afghanistan, and to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan government and other stakeholders,"" her statement continued.

It added that Sullivan ""underscored that the US will support the peace process with a robust and regional diplomatic effort, which will aim to help the two sides achieve a durable and just political settlement and permanent ceasefire.""

Sullivan also discussed the United States' support for protecting recent progress made on women and minority groups' rights as part of the peace process.

When contacted, the Taliban said they remained ""committed to the agreement and honour our commitments"".

""We expect the other side to remain committed to the agreement too,"" Mohammad Naeem, the group's spokesman in Qatar, told AFP.

The move to review the deal was met with a sigh of relief from top officials in Kabul after months of speculation over how the new Biden administration would potentially recalibrate Washington's Afghan policy.

Mohib, the Afghan national security adviser, tweeted that during the call the two sides ""agreed to work toward a permanent ceasefire and a just and durable peace"" in the country.

Another top Afghan government official lambasted the Taliban's failure to live up to the February 2020 deal, saying the agreement had failed to achieve its stated goals.

""The agreement so far did not deliver a desired goal of ending Taliban's violence and bringing a ceasefire desired by the Afghans,"" Sediq Sediqqi, Deputy Interior Minister and former spokesman to President Ashraf Ghani said.

""The Taliban did not live up to its commitments.""

Deadly attacks and high-profile assassinations have increased in recent months, particularly in Kabul where several journalists, activists, judges and politicians have been murdered in brazen daylight attacks.

The Taliban have denied responsibility for these killings, but Afghan and US officials have blamed the group for the murders.

On Tuesday, Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told his Senate confirmation hearing that ""we want to end this so-called forever war.""",Afghan officials welcome Biden plan to review US-Taliban deal,www.centralasiatimes.com

The ministers came to the hall for five minutes after lunch but no discussion happened. Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar clearly refused to repeal the laws while farmers' leaders said that they will continue their protest.

Farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka told IANS that Friday's meeting was very disappointing. ""At lunch, the ministers asked us to discuss the issues among ourselves and left. We kept waiting for them for more than two hours after lunch and later the meeting was called off.""

Another leader Harpreet Singh said the discussion was held for only 20-25 minutes before lunch. ""When the ministers came back after lunch, they asked us to rethink about rejecting the government's proposal to suspend the new farm laws for one and half years.

If you (farmers) have any proposal, then tell us, the government will consider it.""

On the other hand, Tomar told farmers, ""The government is thankful for your cooperation. There is no problem with the laws.

The owners of Big Gay Ice Cream announced in a statement to the East Village blog EV Grieve on Friday that they decided to shutter their original East Seventh Street shop.

Known for its unique treats such as the ""salty pimp"" (vanilla ice cream cone injected with dulce de leche, lightly salted and dipped in a chocolate shell), Big Gay Ice Cream started out as a food truck and has been a staple in the East Village for a decade.

“We always knew that if we ever opened a shop it would be in the East Village. It had to be. In its heyday that section of East Seventh was one of the hottest food blocks in the city — even The New York Times singled it out. We wanted to be right there with Caracas, Luke’s Lobster, Porchetta, Butter Lane and Pylos. Damn, that block had energy and we loved it,” co-owners Doug Quint and Bryan Petroff wrote. “The batteries have gone a bit dim on that street. The empty storefronts (kept vacant by landlords working tax breaks) that plague the city have settled in. It ain’t what it was.”

The pair also said the changing business landscape brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic played a role in their decision and that the small East Village shop would never ""truly recover.""

Though there are no big Covid-19 clusters at present, the dreaded virus has spread geographically across the country due to the unrestricted movement of people, a senior medical official said.

“The transmission of the contagion in small numbers to an extensive region was inevitable in a society which remains ‘open’ with inter-provincial travel happening on a daily basis”, says Dr. Hemantha Herath, Deputy Director of Public Health Services.

He said the spillover from the Western province was expected as there was an outflow of people to other districts particularly during the festive season.

“I am not blaming anybody, but a lockdown was not viable when taking into account the economic consequences and the livelihoods of the people. We could have imposed a curfew to restrict travel during the New Year, but we have to consider the fallout of such a measure”, he noted.

It true that geographically numbers have increased within a wide area, but the numbers are small and there are no big clusters as seen at Minuwangoda and Peliyagoda, the senior medical official explained.

Asked whether the pandemic has translated into a community spread as considerable positive cases continue to emerge on a daily basis, Dr. Herath replied, “no, that has not happened. If the Covid-19 situation was beyond control, we would have made a social and community transmission declaration”.

He said the pandemic situation in the Western province has improved with a dip in positive cases. However, the spillover is evident by the jump in figures at provincial level.

“We knew there was a risk, but we had to take it as locking down the country was not the solution

For example, if a Covid-19 patient infects two persons per day, there will be 200 positive cases within 100 days and one can imagine the critical situation that will emerge if the trend is allowed to continue, Dr. Herath continued.

“We are now managing under 1,000 cases per day”, he said, while assuring that the right mechanism is in place to identify positive cases through PCR and rapid antigen screening and place them under medical treatment, isolate and quarantine first contacts of patients”, he further said.",Covid-19 has now spread geographically across SL,island.lk
493,494,https://www.pix11.com/news/coronavirus/city-state-partner-with-nycha-to-get-seniors-vaccinated,"BROOKLYN — Gov. Andrew Cuomo said New York ran out of COVID-19 vaccinations on Friday, but started getting more for this coming week.

Over 1,000 of those doses will go to NYCHA senior residents beginning Saturday.

Cuomo visited a new vaccination site at the William Reid Apartments in Brooklyn. He said as more vaccines come to New York, vaccination sites will be set up at public housing developments throughout the state, so that those who are eligible don't have to go far to get them.

Jeanette Johnson, 70, got her COVID-19 vaccine Saturday inside of the Brooklyn building where she lives.

“I feel fine, I took it 15 minutes ago,” she said.

Rickford Weekes, who works with seniors in the building, also got his shot.

""My advice is ... what’s the alternative? COVID is killing people. We’ve all taken all different kinds of vaccines, especially us Caribbean people,” Weekes said.

The William Reid Apartments vaccination site is mainly for seniors who live there and essential workers.

Cuomo and local leaders said the state is making vaccines accessible as they come in to the New Yorkers who need it the most, but they have to be willing to take it, especially those who live in communities that were hit the hardest.

“We’re bringing the vaccine to the community, in this case to the residents in this building ... please take it,” Cuomo said.

It’s part of a state partnership with churches and community care centers.

“Today's work to expand the deployment of community vaccination kits is another step to ensure all New Yorkers can gain access they do deeply need,” said Rep. Yvette Clark.

This comes as the state struggles with a shortage in vaccine supply. The governor said the federal government has allocated about 240,000 doses of the vaccine to New York each week, with a promise of a bigger supply — one that has not yet come, prompting thousands of appointment cancellations.

The supply for this week is slowly trickling in.

Right now, the state is putting about 80,000 vaccines in the arms of New Yorkers a day, but according to the governor, they could easily do 100,000.

“We're dependent on the supply. We have the distribution network,” said Cuomo.

While there are still several neighborhoods in the five boroughs with high positivity rates, the governor said overall there has been a decline.

As of Saturday, the state’s positivity rate was 5.26%, with New York City's rate at 5.71%.

“We are urging everyone to trust science and get vaccinated. COVID-19 will kill you,” said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries.

New York is now entering its sixth week of vaccine distribution, and the governor is hoping a bigger supply is given to the state soon so that more residents can get the shot.

In the meantime, local leaders said to call your grandma, grandpa, aunties, uncles and all that you know who are eligible and encourage them to take the vaccine.","City, state partner with NYCHA to get seniors vaccinated",www.pix11.com

495,496,https://pamplinmedia.com/pt/266-politics/495711-397594-merkley-praises-bidens-reversal-of-trumps-anti-immigrant-policies,"U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley has praised President Joe Biden's reversal of Donald Trump's attempts to restrict immigration, including added protection for those brought to the United States illegally as children.

The Oregon Democrat also expressed his hope that upon Trump's departure from the White House, some Republicans will join Democrats in legislation to resolve the status of some of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. Biden proposed legislation on his first day as president.

""Just as we passed a bipartisan immigration bill a few years ago, we had bipartisan support for Dreamers,"" Merkley said in a conference call with Oregon reporters six hours after Biden took his oath as president. ""Maybe we can awaken and drive that same spirit once again.""

Among Biden's 30 executive orders in his first three days as president, five relate to immigration — and one of them reaffirmed legal protections for young immigrants under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program Trump as president tried but failed to end.

President Barack Obama set up the program by an executive order in 2012 to shield them from immediate deportation — if they met specified requirements — and let them obtain renewable two-year work permits. Trump issued an order in 2017 to end the program, but on June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the administration failed to provide sufficient legal justification for doing so. The court ruling left the way open for a new attempt, but the administration did not pursue it.

According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 643,560 people were enrolled in the program as of the latest available figures on March 31, 2020.

A subsequent report by the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank, said nearly half (45%) were from California and Texas. Oregon accounted for 9,710 recipients, who were in households with a total of 20,600 people. They generated an estimated $72 million in federal taxes and $40 million in state and local taxes.

Merkley recounted a speech earlier on Wednesday, Jan. 20, by Sen. Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who is in line to lead the Judiciary Committee, which will consider a comprehensive immigration bill that Biden sent to Congress on his first day as president.

Durbin was the sponsor back in 2001 of the original DREAM Act, spurred by the request of a young Korean immigrant. Republican President George W. Bush was prepared to signal his own support of the bill until Sept. 11, 2001, when the East Coast terrorist attacks doomed its political prospects.

Durbin met Trump at a luncheon not long after Trump became president in 2017. Merkley recounted to reporters what Durbin said about that encounter on Jan. 20:

""He spoke to Trump about his desire to address the challenge that Dreamers in America experienced as children who had never known any other country. They did not speak a different language. They were Americans in every way except their certificate — and we needed to make it right with them so that they could be fully contributing members and seize every opportunity.

""Trump told Durbin four years ago at that luncheon not to worry, that he would take care of it. But he did not take care of it.""

In January 2018, Durbin was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who met with Trump and thought they had the makings of a deal. Two days later, they returned to the White House with a proposal but left empty-handed. Trump said he would support it only in exchange for $25 billion for his proposed border wall with Mexico — construction of which Biden has suspended in another order.

""He said to bring him a bipartisan policy proposal on Dreamers, he would take the heat and he would get it done,"" Merkley said. ""He didn't take the heat, he didn't stand up, he didn't get it done.""

Merkley was among a bipartisan coalition in the Senate that passed a comprehensive immigration bill on June 27, 2013, on a 68-32 vote while Obama was president. Then-majority Democrats were joined by 16 Republicans. But the bill died without a vote in the House, where Republican leaders feared that it would divide their majority.

Biden is trying again with a bill that would allow some of the 11 million undocumented immigrants, including the ""Dreamers,"" to apply immediately for permanent legal residency. Such a status would make them eligible for green cards after paying taxes, submitting to background checks and meeting other requirements. They could apply for full citizenship after three more years; the total would be shorter than the 13 years proposed in the 2013 bill.

Although Merkley does not sit on the Judiciary Committee — he is on the Foreign Relations Committee — he stepped directly into the immigration debate on June 3, 2018, during a visit to the Texas-Mexico border. He did so after he heard talk by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions about a ""zero-tolerance"" policy for unauthorized border crossings, including the separation of children from their families. A staffer suggested that Merkley check it out for himself.

His first stop was to a Customs and Border Protection detention center in McAllen, Texas, part of the Department of Homeland Security. The children he saw were in 30-by-30 chain-link cages. He asked reporters across the street what they had seen, but they had been barred from entry.

His next stop was at Casa Padre detention center in Brownsville, Texas, housed in a former Walmart warehouse and run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services. His staff had sought advance permission, without result, for him to visit.

He never got inside. He did encounter a supervisor, who summoned police to escort Merkley off the grounds.

But Merkley posted his visit live on Facebook — and the video caused the story to take off. The resulting public uproar prompted Trump to deny the child-separation policy that his own administration had in the works for more than a year.

Merkley described Trump's actions in a 2019 book, ""America Is Better Than This: Trump's War Against Immigrant Families,"" and made other visits to the border with Mexico.

Merkley said that at the time of his trips, some of his Republican colleagues in the Senate told him privately they agreed with him. He said he hopes that now, with Trump out of the presidency, some of them will join publicly in true immigration-law change — even though almost all of the Republicans who voted in 2013 have left the Senate, and Republicans remain divided on the issue.

He said to reporters:

""I worked to try to get our government to stand up for those children and end child separation, to treat them with courtesy and respect the moment they came across the border. I heard a lot of Republicans who said they wanted to do that — but none of them would stand up to President Trump and actually drive through a policy that would protect those children.

""I think we have a chance to protect those children now on a bipartisan basis.""

There were indeed thousands of complaints in the emails sent between Nov. 3 and Dec. 8 to lawmakers investigating the election. The majority of them, however, were mass-generated form letters making nonspecific claims about alleged irregularities, a right-wing fraud-finding effort and a clip from Fox’s Sean Hannity show. Others implored Republican lawmakers to overturn an election they were convinced was rigged, even though local, state and national officials have confirmed its integrity. The Wisconsin State Journal was able to identify just 28 allegations of election fraud or other irregularities that were specific enough to attempt to verify, but could only partially substantiate one, involving 42 votes. Interviews with dozens of prosecutors, election officials and people who lodged complaints made clear that most, if not all, of the allegations could be chalked up to hearsay or minor administrative errors. Republican Rep. Ron Tusler said the Assembly Committee on Campaigns and Elections, which he chaired last session, has so far been able to substantiate only one case of potential voter fraud in the Nov. 3 election: A Cedarburg woman was charged in November after she allegedly submitted an absentee ballot for her dead partner.

Besides allegations of fraud, the emails released to the State Journal are also ones containing questions from GOP staff to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, Legislative Reference Bureau and individual city clerks; questions about voter software firm Dominion; complaints about the GOP’s handling of COVID-19 and election fraud complaints; media interview requests; press releases and meeting agendas; references to comments and guests on conservative Dan O’Donnell’s talk radio show; demands to support Trump and award him Wisconsin’s electoral votes; and links to right-wing media stories. Some of the emails called for immediate action, such as one from Tony Magnavito, who urged Republicans to “take the low life Democrats out and shoot them for TREASON.” Others featured pleas from people who simply wanted lawmakers to determine whether there had been fraud, and others demanded lawmakers simply hand the election to a president they deeply admired. “This is 1776 all over for the United States,” wrote John Scharlau. “If we allow this election to be stolen from the greatest president since Lincoln, we will be destroyed from within by America hating, flag burning commies.” Hardly any offered evidence to support their claims of widespread voter fraud, but instead repeated falsehoods about the election, such as those pushed by Trump attorney Sidney Powell about Dominion Voting Systems tabulating software.

Others saw conspiracies in the large number of votes reported for Biden early in the morning after the election, even though election officials had warned for weeks not to expect results from hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots until 3 a.m. or later. In Wisconsin, absentee ballots may not be opened before Election Day, and in some areas, aren’t reported until all of them are counted. Local election clerks are required to report suspected fraud or irregularities to county district attorneys, and the state Elections Commission issues an annual report on those allegations. The WEC report covering the Nov. 3 election is not expected to be released until later this year. But in its last such report, released in September and covering the period from Feb. 16, 2019, through Aug. 21, officials were able to document just 15 cases of suspected fraud or other election problems. Fond du Lac County clerk Lisa Freiberg said the false claims about mass election irregularities and fraud from Trump and his state and federal allies have had a real effect in a “Republican county like mine.” “It’s going to take us years to get people to trust elections again,” she said. “My goal now is to educate legislators on what we do here in Fond du Lac County.” The State Journal attempted to substantiate each of the specific claims reported to lawmakers. Here’s what the newspaper found.

A town of Watertown man let Rep. John Jagler’s office know that when he and his wife voted early at the town’s office, there was no poll book to check their names against and no requirement to provide a photo ID, a violation of the state’s photo ID law. The man’s family later received a call from the Elections Commission letting the couple know that a new poll worker had erred in not requiring IDs and was told to start requiring them of everyone. Town Clerk James Wendt said the worker hadn’t been asking for IDs from people she knew. As for the poll book, Wendt said, it was late to arrive from Jefferson County but that, before it did, election workers kept track of who had voted and later transferred the information to the poll book to ensure no one was able to vote twice. John Christy, a member of the Monroe County Board of Canvassers, told four Republican lawmakers in a Nov. 24 email that he was “extremely distressed and disturbed” by the election and wrote of three or four ballots with unspecified problems in one town. But in response to questions from the State Journal, he said the board took no action to toss the ballots, and he couldn’t specify exactly how the ballots were problematic.

They “looked different for some reason,” Christy said in an email. “They all had initials or signatures on reverse of ballot; but on first glance, they looked different.” Monroe County Clerk Shelley Bohl said that “no claims of fraud were documented” by the board of canvassers. Under state law, ballots cast on Election Day should be initialed by two poll workers, and absentee ballots should be initialed by the clerk or a deputy clerk. “However, if a clerk or poll worker forgets to initial a ballot, nothing in state law says that it must be rejected,” Elections Commission spokesman Reid Magney said. “It’s a general principle that you do not punish a voter if the clerk makes a mistake, as long as the ballot was properly issued to an eligible voter.” In a separate complaint, a Middleton woman complained that her ballot was not initialed by a clerk but was told to feed it through the voting machine anyway. Middleton city clerk Lorie Burns confirmed that some people on the morning of Election Day didn’t have their ballots initialed but, again, the vote still counts. Eighteen people alleged to Republican lawmakers they’d received several blank, unrequested ballots in the mail. Two of the people said they didn’t fill out or retain what they thought were ballots and did not report the mailings to police. One declined in an interview with the State Journal to say whether what she’d received were actually absentee ballots or absentee ballot applications. Of the others the State Journal was able to contact, many declined to provide sufficient detail to investigate their claims.

Your membership makes our reporting possible. {{featured_button_text}} One couple, Scott and Mary Joyce of Jackson, told Republican lawmakers they believed they received unsolicited absentee ballots. But in a phone interview, they described what they got in the mail as missing Trump’s name and not featuring any other political races. That suggests what they thought were ballots probably other campaign-related material or absentee ballot applications. Clerks don’t send out unsolicited ballots, but the ballot application form is publicly available and anyone can send those out, as multiple groups looking to boost voter turnout did prior to the election. This was a trend seen across the country, as well. “My strong sense of this is that these people are confusing absentee ballots with absentee ballot applications,” Magney said. Some people interviewed, however, were adamant that they received unsolicited absentee ballots, but said they’d already torn them up and in some cases declined to provide details, leaving no way to verify their claims. Brenda Woolsey said she, her husband and her adult daughter received unsolicited ballots mailed to them by the town of Union in Eau Claire County. But town of Union Clerk Beverly Christopherson said Woolsey only alleged to her that one ballot was sent to her household unsolicited — for her husband — and that she showed Woolsey that her husband had checked a box on an absentee ballot request form indicating he wanted ballots sent to him for all elections in 2020. Woolsey did bring one ballot in to show her, Christopherson said, but she didn’t have the ballot envelope, so it was impossible to know to whom it had been sent.

Nicole Granato of Menasha said that just by going through publicly available obituaries and the state’s voter information website, she said she was able to find 42 people who voted early but who died before Election Day, meaning that under state law, their votes shouldn’t have been counted. Another man, who did not respond to a request for comment, emailed Tusler and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos on Nov. 17 alleging that someone he did not name in the village of Brandon in Fond du Lac County “voted and has been dead for many years.” Fond du Lac County Clerk Lisa Freiberg said that after speaking with officials in Brandon, she thought she knew who the deceased person in Brandon was but that his ballot was never returned and there was nothing in the village’s post-election numbers to suggest anything amiss. Granato provided records from the state’s MyVote website, which allows people to track a person’s voting history if they have the voter’s name and date of birth. She found 42 people from around Wisconsin who are listed as having voted in the Nov. 3 election but who also appear, according to obituaries that bear the same name and birth date, to have died before that date. “The fact that I was able to easily find 42 people who voted who died before 11/03 is concerning,” she wrote Assembly Speaker Robin Vos in a Nov. 18 email. “It warrants investigation.”

Reached by the State Journal on Friday, the man did not want to named but made clear he was not making any allegations of widespread fraud and thought Wisconsin had handled the election well. Magney said the state’s voting system flags voters registered under similar names and dates of birth and notifies local clerks so that they can investigate and correct poll books, if necessary. “The system isn’t perfect in any way, and occasionally these things come up,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean that somebody’s been voting multiple times.” Two people made specific allegations about vote-counting irregularities in Milwaukee County on Election Day and during the county’s recount. In the first case, a man complained some ballot bags hadn’t been properly sealed in West Allis after being removed from machines after the polls closed. In the second, a man reported that some absentee ballot envelopes from the city of Milwaukee were missing witness information. Neither returned messages left by the State Journal. The complainant in the West Allis case, Alan Marsch, filed complaints with the WEC against three West Allis officials, but in a Jan. 19 letter to the commission, West Allis city attorney Kail Decker said the failure to properly seal ballot bags was a mistake that was “immediately corrected” and that Marsch had not pointed to any evidence that it led to fraud.

In the second case, city of Milwaukee elections staff erred in not properly signing 72 absentee ballot envelopes, according to Milwaukee Election Commission executive director Claire Woodall-Vogg. The county’s Board of Canvassers decided to count the ballots, in line with state guidance not to punish voters whose ballots are marred by errors made by elections officials. Elizabeth Klein, a local clerk in Sawyer County, wrote to lawmakers to say her mother went to vote early in person at the the Sheboygan Public Library but then took the absentee ballot with her to fill out later, something not allowed under the law. Sheboygan City Clerk Meredith DeBruin, however, said the library wasn’t open for in-person absentee voting, but rather only on Election Day. In any event, DeBruin said, people aren’t allowed to carry out ballots. Klein declined to provide further information. A number of people involved in the Dane County recount effort complained about seeing ballots without ward numbers, stamps or clerks’ initials. They also made less specific complaints the State Journal didn’t attempt to verify, including that Dane County recount tabulators flipped too quickly through ballots or that it was difficult for Trump observers to get close enough to see.

Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell said not all ballots use stamps or ward numbers, and instead are differentiated by ballot style. And while state law requires ballots to be initialed, again, it does not say ballots must be thrown out if they lack initials. Madison city clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl said in every election some ballots slip through the cracks and are not initialed, something that could have been a larger problem in November due to the high number of absentee ballot requests. Regarding the recount, McDonell said he told tabulators to slow down so observers could see ballots but that he hadn’t heard that watchers couldn’t get close enough to observe. A man who said he observed the voting at a ward in the city of Racine claimed he witnessed multiple instances in which poll workers asked new registrants to confirm they had lived at their current address for 10 days, even though the law now requires voters to have lived at their address for 28 days. The man declined an interview request, and no one from the Racine Clerk’s office responded to a request for information. Either way, voter registration forms and the certificate on absentee ballot envelopes state the 28-day residency requirement. Clerks are allowed to use forms that contain the old 10-day requirement but are supposed to modify them to reflect the new 28-day requirement.","In 'thousands of complaints' about Wisconsin election, few that could be substantiated",www.lakegenevanews.net
497,498,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/vaccinated-brits-told-act-as-23374521,"The 5.8million Brits who have had the coronavirus vaccine must continue to follow social distancing rules, the deputy chief medical officer for England has warned.

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said it was still not known if people who had been vaccinated could still pass on the virus to others.

He warned the millions who have received the jab must keep following the social distancing rules or risk prolonging lockdown restrictions.

He added if the vaccinated begin to ease social distancing rules because they are protected they are potentially putting at risk those further down the priority list who still need inoculation.

Around 5.8million people have received the first dose of the vaccine in the UK with a record 478,248 getting the jab in a single day, according to Government figures.

Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Prof Van-Tam said it was still not known if people who had been vaccinated could still pass on the virus to others, even though they were protected from falling ill themselves.

""So even after you have had both doses of the vaccine you may still give Covid to someone else and the chains of transmission will then continue,"" he wrote.

""If you change your behaviour you could still be spreading the virus, keeping the number of cases high and putting others at risk who also need their vaccine but are further down the queue.

""Regardless of whether someone has had their vaccination or not, it is vital that everyone follows the national restrictions and public health advice, as protection takes up to three weeks to kick in and we don't yet know the impact of vaccines on transmission.

""The vaccine has brought considerable hope and we are in the final furlong of the pandemic but for now, vaccinated or not, we still have to follow the guidance for a bit longer.""

The deputy chief medical officer's 79-year-old mother Elizabeth Van-Tam had her first dose of the vaccine earlier this week.

Her son had previously shared how he encouraged her to take up the jab when she got the call.

Prof Van-Tam also weighed in on calls for the time between vaccine doses to be halved.

Prof Van-Tam hit back at doctors who have criticised the decision to extend the gap between the first and second doses of the vaccine to 12 weeks.

The British Medical Association has written to the chief medical officer for England urging a rethink, saying that in the case of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine a maximum gap of six weeks had been mandated by the World Heath Organisation (WHO).

Prof Van-Tam said that extending the gap was the quickest way to get a first dose to as many people as possible as quickly as possible.

BMA council chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said that while he understood the ""rationale"" behind the decision, no other country is taking the UK's approach.

""We think the flexibility that the WHO offers of extending to 42 days is being stretched far too much to go from six weeks right through to 12 weeks,"" he said.

""Obviously the protection will not vanish after six weeks but what we do not know is what level of protection will be offered. We should not be extrapolating data where we don't have it.""",Vaccinated Brits told to act 'as if you have Covid and follow social distancing',www.mirror.co.uk
498,499,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/katie-price-issued-harrowing-warning-23369264,"Katie Price has been warned that disabled son Harvey could be sectioned if he is unable to successfully make the transition to college.

As Harvey turns 18, the 42-year-old has been searching for a college that he can attend as he makes the transition to adulthood.

Harvey, who is 29st, was born with Septic Optic Dysplasia, a rare disorder that affects brain function, hormones and vision, and affects 1 in 10,000 births. This means that he has a long list of medical and behavioural conditions, making the search for the right college difficult.

And Katie's fears for her son's future are amplified when mentor Anna Kennedy, who has helped her over the years and started her own college when she was struggling to find provisions for her autistic sons, warns her of what is to come if Harvey is unable to settle.

As the pair meet up in new BBC One documentary Katie Price: Harvey and Me, Anna gives Katie some advice on what to look for in a college for Harvey.

She says: ""The thing is, Kate, there isn't going to be a college that is going to be be 'off the shelf' what you're looking for for Harvey. So the key thing is for him to have peer support, for him to have a good education, for him to have somewhere he's going to be happy and relaxed.

""If the placement doesn't work for Harvey, you don't want it to start affecting his mental health, his wellbeing and then he might self-harm or harm others.""

Katie confirms that Harvey has self-harmed in the past, saying: ""He does that when he gets anxiety, he's got scars.""

Questioned on what other things that worry her, Katie says simply: ""That I'm not there.""

Anna tells her: ""Ok. Not that I want to scare you but if the placement doesn't work the local authority can come in and forcibly take Harvey away if they feel that he's a risk to himself and others and he could end up in a mental health unit or an ATU, which is an assessment and treatment unit.

""Once they've gone in there it's really difficult to get them out. So they've been sectioned. As a parent, that is a really, really difficult thing to take on board.""

Katie is stunned, but insists that she wouldn't allow it to ""get that far"".

""It is, but I feel comfy that it wouldn't get that far because I know signs of Harvey,"" she says. ""I know when he's upset.""

Anna retorts that Katie won't be there, to which she responds: ""I will be there, I'll be there visiting him. I just know Harv - if he's not happy, he'll tell me.""

But later on in the documentary, Katie meets a mother, Isabel, who speaks of her devastation over her disabled son being sectioned.

Isabel claims that her son was ""forcibly injected"" and drugged in the institution.

""The guilt that I felt that my son was in this place,"" she tearfully tells Katie. ""All these horrible things were being done to him.""

Isabel was able to get a second opinion from another medical team, and she was able to get her son out.

""It's shocking to know that human being sitting next to me has experienced that,"" Katie says. ""And that's something that maybe I could experience with Harvey just because of how the system works.""

Snow blockade leads to 2 days without trains in Summit County

A severe snow and wind storm in the latter half of last week afflicted the county with the first blockade of the present winter on last Friday and Saturday, when no trains went over the High Line of the Colorado & Southern Railway in either direction.

Although the storm was still in progress, a rotary snowplow was sent west out of Como on Saturday, and returning from Leadville, it opened the road for trains each way that day.

The promptness for opening the road was due largely to the fact that 22 cars of lower Blue River cattle were awaiting shipment.

Record crowds of interested visitors attended the National Western Stock Show in Denver. While some good-naturedly grumbled about the price of concessions, as an exhibition, the show was a “hummer.” The cattle, sheep and hogs in every class were the kind that delight the eye of the rancher and the lover of good animals. Equally fine exhibits of fowls and rabbits were found, not to mention specimens of brood skunks, cavies (a rodent family that includes Guinea pigs) and others.

The horse show certainly drew the crowds at the arena performances. The horseflesh in Denver this week was equal to any ever shown in the West.

Dillon sends 22 cars of cattle to the stock show

On last Friday, just as the first real blizzard of the winter was at its height, 405 head of cattle arrived in Dillon from the lower Blue River area for shipment to the stock show at Denver. Although our railroad acted with admirable promptness in opening its badly-blocked High Line tracks, it was Monday before engines and crews were able to move the 22 cars required to accommodate the cattle.

Of the cars, 21 contained 385 head of stock, fat Herefords from the Hanks Bros. (Mount Powell) ranch. The other car had 20 head from John Nelson’s ranch.

Although of the highest quality, the cattle are said to have brought a heavy financial loss to the shippers because of the slump in market prices between the dates of buying and selling.

From all accounts Kokomo will soon experience a mining boom. The switch leading to the Wilfley mill was to have been plowed out this week, and new machinery will be hauled to the mill, so it will soon commence operations.

A new process of oil flotation, known as the Terry Process is to be installed. Several tests have already been made on the Kokomo ores in a Leadville plant, and it has been found to be very applicable to that nature of ore.

The Blue River Placer Mining Company is the name of the new incorporation that has taken over the interest of the Blue River Dredging Company, and are now operating on what was locally known as the Lambing placer. The articles of incorporation for the new company were filed this week.

500,501,https://artdaily.com/news/132302/Exhibition-at-Marc-Straus-presents-a-new-body-of-work-by-Marie-Watt,"Marie Watt (b.1967, Seattle) is a citizen of the Seneca Nation, the largest of six Nations in the Iroquois Confederacy. Mythologies and history from her Native American heritage inform her process and are seamlessly interwoven in her art with commentary on international politics and pop culture references. 

 

Her layered points of influence are often reflected in her use of text elements featuring language drawn from Indigenous knowledge and Iroquois proto-feminism, the matriarchal structures of certain Native American tribes, the rise of social activism throughout the 20th century, and the anti-war and anti-hate content of 1960s and 1970s music- such as the Marvin Gaye song, Whats Going On. Messages of both longing and hope from the past that still resonate today.

In this new body of artworks by Watt there is a recurring use of the word Skywoman, who is a central figure in Iroquois origin story. The creation story relates that a fallen sacred tree tore a hole in the clouds in the Sky World that she fell through. Birds, and then animals help Sky Woman settle on what becomes Turtle Island. In acknowledgement for the way animals helped Sky Woman, the Iroquois consider animals their first teachers. This historic relationship is also acknowledged in the clan system; Watt is from the Turtle clan. Watt extends perceptions often associated with close family members and contemplates a greater connectedness between larger populations including animals and the environment. 

 

Her use of textiles is a central tenet of her work. Whether a shirt or a blanket, these are items that protect us against cold and external dangers. In Companion Species (Guardian/Auntie) she uses reclaimed army blankets, which are used to camouflage and conceal their human counterparts in nature.

For over 15 years Watt has been creating hand sewn tapestries, often realized through collaboration with sewing circles around North America. For Watt the use of secondhand blankets is essential; they come imbued with life, embedded with their own history and stories.

The word Skywalker has captured Maries imagination as a word that refers to this space that seems otherworldly, mythic, and magical while serving as a conduit for the past into the present. Sapling and Flint are the twin grandsons of Skywoman and are creator/ destroyer figures essential to creation of the physical world as we know it.

 Marie Watt (b.1967, Seattle) is a citizen of the Seneca Nation, the largest of six Nations in the Iroquois Confederacy. Mythologies and history from her Native American heritage inform her process and are seamlessly interwoven in her art with commentary on international politics and pop culture references.Her layered points of influence are often reflected in her use of text elements featuring language drawn from Indigenous knowledge and Iroquois proto-feminism, the matriarchal structures of certain Native American tribes, the rise of social activism throughout the 20th century, and the anti-war and anti-hate content of 1960s and 1970s music- such as the Marvin Gaye song, Whats Going On. Messages of both longing and hope from the past that still resonate today.Some works in this exhibition, for the first time allude to the writing of Joy Harjo, the 23rd US Poet Laureate, and the first Native American named to the role.In this new body of artworks by Watt there is a recurring use of the word Skywoman, who is a central figure in Iroquois origin story.

501,502,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/covid-vaccine-wont-be-a-shot-in-arm-for-inbound-tourism-to-ireland-b6nzjhfmm,"A new study by Tourism Ireland has warned that the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines may not result in a “speedy return” to normal levels of inbound tourism to Ireland.

The state agency commissioned a Red C survey of 4,000 holidaymakers across four key markets: Britain, America, Germany and France. It found that just under half of those who said they were willing to be vaccinated were either unsure of their post-vaccine travel plans or would not resume normal travel after receiving their doses.

There was widespread support for some form of Covid-19 testing for those travelling around Europe. Tourism Ireland noted “mixed feelings” towards paying for tests, however, which it said “could prove to be a further barrier to future travel plans”.",Covid vaccine won’t be a shot in arm for inbound tourism to Ireland,www.thetimes.co.uk

503,504,https://www.speedcafe.com/2021/01/24/van-gisbergen-scores-second-straight-trs-win/,"Shane van Gisbergen has won a frenetic New Zealand Grand Prix precursor at Hampton Downs Motorsport Park.

The Red Bull-backed driver led the way from pole position, surviving a mid-race attack from Chris van der Drift to win the 20-lap affair.

The Supercars regular will be hard-pressed to repeat his opening efforts in the weekend’s feature New Zealand Grand Prix, however, starting from 10th after a wet qualifying.

“It was awesome, but this afternoon is going to be hard starting 10th,” said the Kiwi.

“I really struggled at the start. We put some other brake pads in, my old ones, so I couldn’t get the balance.

“I was locking brakes, Chris was all over me, but we’ll put the good pads in for this afternoon when we need to pass some people.

“Awesome to see a big crowd here. Tony [Quinn] and his Hampton Downs team, they should be stoked with what we’ve got here. It’s an awesome event.

“I’m going to be passing some cars this afternoon hopefully. I hope it’s a good show.”

Van Gisbergen got the holeshot into Turn 1, leading van der Drift through the sweeping right hander initially.

Behind them, Brendon Leitch got a strong getaway from fifth on the grid to usurp third and fourth place starters Matthew Payne and Kaleb Ngatoa.

Ngatoa was a slow starter, falling to seventh by the end of Lap 1.

Billy Frazer made headway on the opening lap, climbing to fifth behind Payne while Dan Gaunt was sixth.

Peter Vodanovich, Andre Heimgartner, and Greg Murphy completed the top 10 at the end of the first lap.

Murphy was an early casualty in the race, suffering front wing damage after making contact with Heimgartner in the opening proceedings.

The four-time Bathurst 1000 winner was subsequently given a mechanical black flag, deciding to retire from Race 2.

At the front of the field, van Gisbergen and van der Drift traded fastest laps, the margin toing and froing.

Their battle was stalled when Tom Alexander beached his car on Lap 8 on the exit of the Double Bastard and duly brought out the Safety Car.

The green flag flew with nine laps to go, van der Drift putting pressure on van Gisbergen into Turn 1.

The pair went side-by-side into Turn 2, which brought Leitch into the battle. However, the order stabilised.

Further afield, Gaunt suffered front wing damage after making contact with Payne as he sought to take fourth. Like Murphy, Gaunt brought his race to a premature end.

The dying stages of the race saw Leitch fall into the clutches of Payne. As they battled, Heimgartner came into play.

Payne sought to make a move at the Dipper, getting alongside Leitch. As they went side-by-side into the final turn, Heimgartner tried to go around them both.

Leitch hung Payne out to dry, allowing Heimgartner to come through. However, Payne was given a free-kick when Leitch and Heimgartner made contact at the Turn 2 hairpin.

The pair both suffered damage and were forced to retire from the race.

With Heimgartner’s car too damaged, he stopped on track and the Safety Car was subsequently brought out.

In the end, van Gisbergen crossed the line under the control of the Safety Car with van der Drift second and Payne third.

Ngatoa was fourth and Damon Leitch fifth while the top 10 was completed by Conrad Clark, Peter Vodanovich, Joshua Bethune, Billy Frazer, and Chris Vlok.",Van Gisbergen scores second straight TRS win,www.speedcafe.com
504,505,https://island.lk/biden-harris-inauguration-ceremonies-and-poets-of-democracy/,"The present-day sky is crowded. Airways crisscross above continents and oceans and are severely congested with all kinds of aeroplanes carrying passengers and cargo. Then someone crashes, people die, and we say, “What a shame!” The manufacturers start defending their aeroplane, the insurance companies look for loopholes to creep through and save their bacon. Of course, there is always the ever-present ‘pilot error’ verdict to take the final blame. That is what happens in air crashes and crash causes. The dying or the surviving is seldom man-made. It is all done upstairs and has little to do with what we deduce from what we know or hear. I have seen enough of the sky and what happens in it to figure that out.

On 7 August 1997, a Fine Air DC-8-61F took off from Miami International on a direct flight to Santo Domingo. It was a cargo flight, two pilots and a Flight Engineer plus a security officer were the only occupants. The DC-8 rolled off on Runway 27 Right and eased into the azure blue Florida sky.

That’s when the trouble started. The first officer was flying, and he could not control the pitch attitude of the aeroplane, and the nose kept creeping up. The speed started bleeding off and the big cargo jet stalled and crashed 3000 ft beyond the end of the runway. It instantly killed the four people on board and also a luckless motorist who was passing on the road beyond the airfield.

The investigation proved the DC-8 was loaded incorrectly by the cargo people and the trim settings shown were wrong.

The load sheet is given to the Captain a few minutes before the doors are closed. It shows how the aeroplane is loaded and how the centre of gravity is calculated by the load master who decides how the payload should be distributed. If he makes a mistake, and the Captain fails to notice it, no one would know that till the aeroplane rotates and the pitch attitude misbehaves. At times it could become almost impossible to fly the aeroplane.

That’s one down and two to go of the three stories.

The Ethiopian 707 cargo aeroplane was loaded and ready for takeoff in Fiumicino Airport in Rome on 19th November 1977. It was a two-sector flight, first to Asmara and then to Addis Ababa, carrying a consignment of tyres. There were five onboard, the two pilots and the Flight Engineer and two security officers.

The aeroplane was almost fully loaded with heavy cargo plus 11,000 gallons of fuel. The Captain checked the load sheet and calculated the take-off power needed and set the stabilizer trim according to the units that were displayed in the load sheet.

The 707 rolled out of Fiumicino and took off. It is not clear what happened; the theories are multiple. The 707 could not be controlled in the pitching and nosedived to a scrub bush jungle on the extended centerline of the runway.

All five people in the aircraft died. The 11,000 gallons of fuel burned the fuselage to cinders. Maybe the calculated trim was wrong or maybe the loading of the cargo was not according to centre of gravity limits. Some even said the cargo pallets may have shifted. Either way, the five people who died lost their lives in vain, perhaps due to a loading mistake.

And now I come to the third aeroplane, the one that got away.

No, this I did not take from any record book; nor is it a trumped-up story from a third or fourth party. This is straight from the horse’s mouth. It was the surviving pilot who laid bare all the facts of this incredible story. Captain Jaya Seneviratne is no more, he passed away some years ago. First Officer Nihal Jayawickrema flew almost every jet aeroplane that served Sri Lanka and retired after being the Director of Flight Operations in the national carrier. I write this in honour of these two pilots. Let the truth be on record, stated as it happened so that such professional pinnacles are remembered and told and re-told for future generations.

The year was 1971. The JVP had taken up arms to fight the ruling coalition of the Sirimavo Bandaranaike government. At the start the armed forces were ill-prepared to contain the onslaught of the youth uprising. The pendulum swung both ways and hundreds from the two sides died in vain. I better stop that sad story now before I forget my purpose and blast away at things that are best left unsaid.

Ammunition and soldiers had to be moved to fight the JVP. Road transport was difficult due to guerilla-type ambushers. The safest was by air, load an old DC-3 and fly wherever you wanted. Such was the plan when Capt. Seneviratne and F/O Jayawickrema got onboard to fly from Ratmalana to Vavuniya. They had to carry some soldiers and a lot of ammunition boxes that weighed like concrete blocks. Of course, there were no cabin crew, and strangely more passengers than seats, more like military musical chairs. The plane had to fly to Vavuniya, unload soldiers and ammo and return empty to Ratmalana. Of course, whoever ordered the flight had thrown away the rule book. There was no LOAD SHEET. This was an emergency; nobody knew how much the payload weighed and where the trim sheet centre of gravity was. The Captain was a grizzly old school veteran, and the F/O was a bright young spark, and between them they were more than capable of flying to Vavuniya and back. Passengers seated and standing, limitlessly over-loading, and with enough ammunition to make it a flying bomb if any emergency occurred, somebody sure had vapourised the rule book. Had to be somebody big!

They started engines and taxied to line up on runway 04 (heading north/east) and opened full power for the take-off. It was slow to gather speed and almost ran to the other end before the Captain gently eased the control column back and got the lumbering DC-3 to get airborne. The instant Capt. Seneviratne lifted the plane he would have known something was very wrong. The old Dakota was climbing foot by foot while the F/O retracted the gear and the flaps. The aeroplane was still not climbing, the two pilots knew they were flying a heavily over-weight aeroplane which had been loaded with total disregard for its centre of gravity.

From here onwards I am writing exactly what First Officer Jayawickrema told me. This is no fairy tale, but some clever piece of flying which was completely out of the box.

The old Dakota crawled to 1500 feet and stopped climbing. Too heavy and completely out of trim. The Captain turned left and stayed on top of the northern Bolgoda Lake and followed the waterway to Dehiwela. There they turned left and followed the snaking canal to the sea, safe from tall buildings at 1500 ft. Once they crossed the rail-track and the beach, they turned North and flew over the water parallel to the coast. Now they were safe at this low altitude and the Captain sent the First Officer to check the situation in the cabin. There were 24 seats and 38 passengers and so many ammunition boxes that were loaded on the floor at the back. The seatless passengers had conveniently sat on the iron boxes and made themselves comfortable. No wonder the Dakota was over-weight and completely out of trim. It was a minor miracle the Dakota made it to 1500 ft. The pilots decided to fly low level over the sea and head North and somewhere near Kalpitiya to turn right and make a direct track to Vavuniya.

The Captain called the leader of the soldiers and explained and requested the passengers who had no seats to bring the ammo boxes forward along the aisle and the soldiers to sit on them. This was clever thinking. Boxes and men shifted up the aisle, the aircraft was better balanced after the seatless passengers re-located. However, the crew stuck to their original plan to coast-crawl and managed to climb a little too. They flew past Negombo, Chilaw, spotted Deduru-Oya and Puttalam and reached Kalpitiya. There they turned right to track to Vauniya, flying over Wilpattu and Thanthirimalai. The fading sun was still giving enough light and they came to Vavuniya and spotted a clearing amidst the scrub bush. The runway was just a flat strip, a relic from the old second world war days where the RAF had a squadron of Hurricanes based in Vavuniya. That was all gone now and there was only a little hut and a watcher who was there to guard (I do not know from what) but perhaps to chase the cattle that strayed on to the airfield.

The DC-3 usually approached to land at 65-70 knots. But the crew knew she weighed so much more than her maximum landing weight with ammo boxes and 38 passengers. The pilots had to come much faster to land and to avoid stalling the plane. The Dakota did not have stall warning devices. Capt. Seneviratne compromised and made his approach to runway 05 at 100 knots. It would have been an extremely difficult task, an over-weight DC-3 approaching at 100 knots, on a short field of around 1500 meters. There were no guide lights or runway markings to gauge the descent path. The flare alone would have been so difficult to judge; the deck sure was stacked against the pilots, nerve-racking to say the least.

They touched down and went straight for the brakes, but the speed was too high and the runway too short. The Dakota over ran the threshold on the far end and went into a ditch that was full of mud. The nose was down, and the tail was up but no one was hurt.

Considering all factors including the part they over ran the short, unmarked runway, I think it was a brilliant piece of flying. From take-off to touch down it was all seat of the pants out of the box handling and decision-making. My humble opinion says if one was to study everything that happened and how they survived – this sure was a class act.

The soldiers disembarked carrying their ammunition and the crew followed. They inspected the Dakota and saw nothing had happened to the rugged aeroplane except some torn canvases in the tailplane. Ropes were brought and the 38 soldiers pushed and pulled the Dakota and got it out of the ditch. Her wheels were caked with mud and the wheel bays too were pretty badly soiled. Once the soldiers got the aeroplane to hard ground they turned it to face runway 23. The pilots got in and they had to do a battery start. This was tricky, but the crew knew their business. The starter rotated the prop, fuel flowed, ignitors fired, and the engine coughed and smoked as the 14 cylinders came to life. That sure is the sweetest sound from a Pratt and Whitney engine. Both engines started singing and it was all set to go; the Dakota took off on runway 23 and flew to Ratmalana.

They radioed Engineering in Ratmalana and told the Vavuniya story. The men who manned Ratmalana were a special breed.They were ‘Hammer and Spanner’ trouble-fixers who were Grand Masters of the DC-3. By the time the Dakota landed the engineers were ready with high pressure hoses to peel the mud off and also had an expert to stitch the torn tail plane canvas. Some names I remember. It is my privilege to mention them. G.V. Perera, Noel Peiris, Sath Silva, JCT, Quintus Gunasekara, Piya. I remember, the rest were equally good, but I am sad I cannot re-collect all the names.

The engineers took over the aeroplane and the pilots went home.

The following morning my friend Jayawickrema rode his bicycle and came to the airport. The DC-3 was taxiing out for take-off, on the morning flight to Jaffna.

“She looked the beauty she always was” he nostalgically murmured. “Even spruced up by her high-pressure water bath. I couldn’t believe this was the same aeroplane that made an approach at 100 knots to land at a short strip in Vavuniya and ended up in a ditch, full of mud.”

Some pilots crash and die, and some survive. The script is decided by fate that flings the dice. You win some, you lose some and if you are lucky, you live to tell the tale.

Some call it consecration; some call it God.

506,507,https://www.columbian.com/news/2021/jan/23/mexican-leader-says-biden-offers-4-billion-for-central-america/,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden’s first calls to foreign leaders went to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador at a strained moment for the U.S. relationship with its North American neighbors.

Mexico’s president said Saturday that Biden told him the U.S. would send $4 billion to help development in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala — nations whose hardships have spawned tides of migration through Mexico toward the United States.

Lopez Obrador, who spoke Friday with Biden by phone, said the two discussed immigration and the need to address the root causes of why people migrate.

Mexico has stopped recent attempts by caravans of Central American migrants to cross Mexico.

Biden’s call to Trudeau, also on Friday, came after the Canadian prime minister last week publicly expressed disappointment over Biden’s decision to issue an executive order halting construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. The long-disputed project was projected to carry some 800,000 barrels of oil a day from the tar sands of Alberta to the Texas Gulf Coast, passing through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma.

Biden told Trudeau that by issuing the order he was following through on a campaign pledge to stop construction of the pipeline, a senior Canadian government official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the conversation.",Mexican leader says Biden offers $4 billion for Central America,www.columbian.com
507,508,https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/bidens-early-approach-to-virus-underpromise-overdeliver/2421235/,"President Joe Biden, in his first three days in office, has painted a bleak picture of the country's immediate future, warning Americans that it will take months, not weeks, to reorient a nation facing a historic convergence of crises.

The dire language is meant as a call to action, but it's also a deliberate effort to temper expectations. In addition, it is an explicit rejection of President Donald Trump’s tack of talking down the coronavirus pandemic and its economic toll.

Chris Lu, a longtime Obama administration official, said the grim tone is aimed at “restoring trust in government” that eroded during the Trump administration.

“If you’re trying to get people to believe in this whole system of vaccinations, and if you want people to take seriously mask mandates, your leaders have to level with the American people,” he said.

Biden said Thursday that “things are going to continue to get worse before they get better” and offered “the brutal truth” that it will take eight months before a majority of Americans will be vaccinated.

On Friday, he declared outright: “There’s nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months.”

It's all part of Biden's pledge that his administration will ""always be honest and transparent with you, about both the good news and the bad.”

That approach, aides say, explains Biden’s decision to set clear and achievable goals for his new administration. The measured approach is drawing praise in some corners for being realistic -— but criticism from others for its caution.

Trump often dismissed the seriousness of the virus and even acknowledged to journalist Bob Woodward that he deliberately played down the threat to the U.S. to prop up the economy. Even as death tolls and infection rates soared, Trump insisted the country was already “rounding the turn.”

Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said Biden’s pledge for 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days in office might fall short of what’s needed to turn the tide on the virus.

“Maybe they’re picking a number that’s easier to achieve, rather than the number that we need to achieve. I would urge people to be bolder than that,” he said.

Adalja argued that the goal they’ve set “should be the bare minimum that we accept.” But he also acknowledged that there’s a major political risk in overpromising.

“You don’t want people to be discouraged or feel like the government is incompetent” if they fail to meet a goal, he said.

Biden on Friday acknowledged the criticism, saying he was hopeful for more vaccinations, but he avoided putting down a marker that could potentially fall out of reach.

“I found it fascinating that yesterday the press asked the question, ‘Is 100 million enough?'"" he said in the State Dining Room. ""A week before, they were saying, ‘Biden, are you crazy? You can’t do 100 million in 100 days.’ Well, we’re — God willing — not only going to 100 million. We’re going to do more than that.”

In fact, while there was some skepticism when Biden first announced the goal on Dec. 8, it was generally seen as optimistic but within reach.

The Biden administration might be taking lessons from the earliest days of the Obama administration, when there was constant pressure to show real progress in turning around the economy during the financial crisis.

One former Obama administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak freely about internal conversations, said there was a fevered effort during the first few months of Obama's first term to play down the focus on evaluating the president’s success within his first 100 days because aides knew the financial recovery would take far longer than that.

In one notable misstep, Obama’s National Economic Council chair, Christina Romer, predicted that unemployment wouldn’t top 8% if Congress passed the administration’s stimulus package to address the financial crisis. It was signed into law a month into Obama's first term, but by the end of that year, unemployment nevertheless hit 10%.

The risk in setting too rosy expectations is that an administration might become defined by its failure to meet them. President George W. Bush’s “Mission Accomplished” speech in 2003 — at a time when the Iraq War was far from over — became a defining blunder of his presidency.

Trump provided an overreach of his own in May 2020, when he said the nation had “prevailed” over the virus. At the time, the country had seen about 80,000 deaths from the virus. This week, the U.S. death toll topped 412,000.

Trump’s lax approach and lack of credibility contributed to poor adherence to public safety rules among the American public.

Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Trump’s handling of the virus caused so much damage to public perceptions of its severity that it’s important for Biden to set a contrasting tone.

“I think it is really important to start telling the American people the truth. And that has not happened in a year, since we found the first case of coronavirus, so he’s got a lot of damage to undo,” she said.

“This is a very serious, very contagious, deadly disease, and anything other than that message — delivered over and over again — is, unfortunately, adding to the willingness of lots of people to pay no attention to how to stop the spread of the disease.”","Biden's Early Approach to Virus: Underpromise, Overdeliver",www.nbcchicago.com

509,510,https://www.forsythnews.com/news/lake-lanier/georgia-ties-up-loose-end-from-water-wars-has-certainty-of-water-supply-in-lake-lanier/,"Georgia and the Army Corps of Engineers have agreed to a $71 million water contract for permanent water storage at Lake Lanier.

The move ties up a loose end from 2012, when the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that water supply was an original, authorized purpose of Lanier.

“This achievement is the culmination of years of hard work on the part of governors [Brian] Kemp and [Nathan] Deal, and our federal delegation … negotiating with members of multiple federal administrations,” Kemp’s press secretary, Mallory Blount, told The Gainesville Times in an email Friday, Jan. 22. “The agreement will mean greater certainty of water supply for much of Georgia.”

Water storage talks between Georgia and the Corps began in 2017, after the Corps approved Georgia’s request to reallocate the storage space among Lanier’s water suppliers. The overall storage space is projected to meet projected municipal and industrial water supply through 2050, Richard Dunn, Environmental Protection Division director, has said.

The two sides signed a 10-page agreement effective Wednesday, Jan. 20, that requires payments over 30 years from the state to the Corps.

Water providers around the lake, including Gainesville Department of Water Services, will share in the costs based on pro rata usage, said Linda MacGregor, director of the Gainesville utility.

Those dollar amounts, along with allocations, will be reflected in subcontracts between Georgia and the utilities. The subcontracts have yet to be issued.

“We think (that will happen) soon, but everything takes time,” MacGregor said.","Georgia ties up loose end from water wars, has ‘certainty of water supply’ in Lake Lanier",www.forsythnews.com
510,511,https://www.gattonstar.com.au/news/covid-vaccine-jabs-to-be-bulk-billed/4184471/,"Doctors around the country will bulk bill COVID-19 vaccines.

While the Pfizer vaccine will be delivered in hospitals and Pfizer hubs due to the stringent storage refrigeration requirements GPs will be mostly responsible for administering up to 53 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Both COVID vaccines require two shots within 21 days.

Under the Medicare Benefits Schedule finalised on Friday, doctors will be paid $30.76 for the first consult and $24.25 for the second.

There will be an additional $10 incentive for practices to ensure both shots are delivered at the one surgery.

Expressions of interest for GP practices opened on Saturday with the hope up to 1000 practices would register.

Health Minister Greg Hunt said ""early indications are that supply will far exceed our expectations which is fantastic"".

Mr Hunt told The Sunday Telegraph delivery of the free vaccines must be bulk billed.

""It is to be universally bulk billed, we've said from the outset it will be free,"" he said.

It is most likely the larger practices will offer jabs as they have the medical personnel and the space to offer socially distanced environment to patients.

Dr Brian Morton, who runs a 10 doctor practice at Northbridge, said his practice was prepared to bulk bill and wear any extra costs.

""We are never really paid the true cost but this is a pandemic emergency so we will provide the service, but we will need a staff member to check in patient, a nurse and we need more space to keep people for the recommended 15 minutes after vaccination,"" Dr Morton said.

""The fee (on offer) if you are efficient enough, that should be enough recompense. But, if you are smaller practice with only two or three doctors, you are not going to be able to scale up, you need to do the paper work to get the vaccine, you need the space in the fridge to store it, for a small practice it may not be worth it.""

Dr Karen Price, President of Royal Australian College of General Practitioners said doctors had argued the COVID vaccination program is not a standard consult.

""Whether or not that is sufficient to cover the costs of delivering that service is a question. The one thing I don't want for our members is they take a pay cut to do all that it costs to deliver the biggest public health delivery in Australia's recent history,"" Dr Price said.

""It is very different, this is not the flu vax roll out, this is a new vaccine, it requires two doses and there's a lot more recording and audit, but there's a lot of vaccine hesitancy because people are confused.

Dr Price said it will be up to individual practices to assess if they can provide viably provide the service.

Australian Medical Association president Dr Omar Khorshid said they had ""worked very closely with the government to make sure the Medicare arrangements are going to underpin the successful rollout of the program"".

""We are comfortable where it has landed. Any practice that feels it doesn't work for them presumably won't put in an expression of interest, it's not automatic and if they can't make it work financially, presumably they won't participate, but the majority will, we need to try and vaccinate 20 million people and we need the majority of general practice involved, "" Dr Khorshid said.

511,512,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/focus/2021/01/24/science-has-delivered-the-vaccines-will-the-wto-deliver-accessibility,"A PROPOSAL by India, South Africa and eight other countries calls on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to exempt member countries from enforcing some patents and other intellectual property rights under the organisation’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for a limited period. It is to ensure that intellectual property rights do not restrict the rapid scaling up of manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines. While a few members have raised concerns about the proposal, a large proportion of the WTO membership supports it. It has also received the backing of international organisations and global civil society.

Unprecedented times call for unorthodox measures. We saw this in the efficacy of strict lockdowns for a limited period as a policy intervention in curtailing the spread of the pandemic. The International Monetary Fund in its October 2020 edition of World Economic Outlook states, “However, the risk of worse growth outcomes than projected remains sizable. If the virus resurges, progress on treatments and vaccines is slower than anticipated, or countries’ access to them remains unequal, economic activity could be lower than expected, with renewed social distancing and tighter lockdowns.”

The situation appears to be grimmer than predicted, we have already lost 7% of economic output from the baseline scenario projected in 2019. It translates to a loss of more than US$6tril (RM24.2tril) of global gross domestic product. Even a 1% improvement in global GDP from the baseline scenario will add more than US$800bil (RM3.2tril) in global output, offsetting the loss certainly of a much lower order to a sector of economy on account of the waiver.

Merely a signal to ensure timely and affordable access to vaccines and treatments will work as a big confidence booster for demand revival in the economy. With the emergence of successful vaccines, there appears to be some hope on the horizon.

But how will these be made accessible and affordable to the global population? The fundamental question is whether there will be enough Covid-19 vaccines to go around. As things stand, even the most optimistic scenarios today cannot assure access to vaccines and therapeutics for the majority of the population, in rich as well as poor countries, by the end of 2021.

All the members of the WTO have agreed that there is an urgent need to scale up the manufacturing capacity for vaccines and therapeutics to meet the massive global need. The TRIPS waiver proposal seeks to fulfil this need by ensuring that intellectual property barriers do not get in the way of such efforts.

Existing flexibilities under the TRIPS agreement are not adequate as these were not designed with pandemics in mind. Normal procedure requires that compulsory licenses are issued on a country by country, case by case and product by product basis, where every jurisdiction with an intellectual property regime would have to issue separate compulsory licenses, making collaboration among countries extremely onerous. While we usually encourage the use of TRIPS flexibilities, they are time-consuming and cumbersome to implement and, hence, cannot ensure the timely access of affordable vaccines and treatments.

Similarly, we have not seen very encouraging progress on the World Health Organisation’s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) initiative, which encourages voluntary contribution of intellectual property, technology and data to support the global sharing and scaling up of the manufacturing of Covid-19 medical products. Voluntary licenses, even where they exist, are shrouded in secrecy. Their terms and conditions are not transparent. Their scope is limited to specific amounts or for a limited subset of countries, thereby encouraging nationalism rather than true international collaboration.

Global cooperation initiatives such as the Covax Mechanism and the ACT-Accelerator are inadequate to meet the massive global needs of 7.8 billion people. The ACT-A initiative aims to procure two billion doses of vaccines by the end of next year and distribute them fairly around the world. With a two-dose regime, however, this will only cover one billion people. That means that even if ACT-A is fully financed and successful, which is not the case presently, there would not be enough vaccines for the majority of the global population.

During the initial few months of the pandemic, we have seen that shelves were emptied by those who had access to masks, personal protective equipment, sanitiser, gloves and other essential Covid-19 items even without their immediate need. The same should not happen to vaccines.

Eventually, the world was able to ramp up manufacturing of pandemic essentials as intellectual property barriers were not involved. At present, we need the same pooling of rights and know-how for scaling up the manufacturing of vaccines and treatments, which unfortunately has not been forthcoming, necessitating the need for the waiver.

It is the pandemic – an extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime event – that has mobilised the collaboration of multiple stakeholders. It is knowledge and skills held by scientists, researchers, public health experts and universities that have enabled the cross-country collaborations and enormous public funding that has facilitated the development of vaccines in record time – and not intellectual property!

The TRIPS waiver proposal is a targeted and proportionate response to the exceptional public health emergency that the world faces today. Such a waiver is well within the provisions of Article IX of the Marrakesh Agreement that established the WTO. It can help in ensuring that human lives are not lost for want of timely and affordable access to vaccines.

The adoption of the waiver will also reestablish WTO’s credibility and show that the multilateral trading system continues to be relevant and can deliver in times of crisis. Now is the time for WTO members to act and adopt the waiver to save lives and help in getting the economy back on the revival path quickly.

While making the vaccines available was a test of science, making them accessible and affordable is going to be a test of humanity. History should remember us for the “AAA rating”, ie, for the availability, accessibility and affordability of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, and not for a single “A rating” for availability only. Our future generations deserve nothing less. – Korea Herald/Asia News Network

512,513,https://portcitydaily.com/brews-and-bites/2021/01/23/port-city-taste-kick-off/,"WILMINGTON — Port City Daily will kick off its inaugural restaurant week, Port City Taste, on Monday, Jan. 25. Featuring more than 20 restaurants offering special prix-fixe menus, the celebration of supporting all-local eats will extend through Feb. 7.

Port City Taste comes at an integral time for southeastern N.C.’s restaurant industry. The winter off-season is traditionally the slowest time of year. Not to mention, it’s been a rough year for businesses having to deal with the effects of a pandemic.

According to the National Restaurant Association, around $240 billion was lost in sales in 2020 from restaurants enduring shutdowns and abnormal hours, switching models to mostly takeout, and amending operations if Covid-19 showed up in their eateries among staff or customers.

RELATED: The 2020 Dish: Restaurants open and close, business owners reflect on a year of struggles

Because of such, Port City Taste will ensure that diners can support their favorite restaurants and feel safe doing so. Port City Taste menus are available for dine-in (mask mandates and Covid-19 protocols enforced) and some are even takeout, so everyone can participate.

Offers vary from restaurant to restaurant — casual to fine dining, two-course lunches for $12, four-course dinners for $30, and three-course dinners for two for $45. Diners will enjoy a range of eats: American, Asian, Italian, Low-Country, sandwiches, pizza, seafood, salads, vegan dishes — and of course dessert. Some even include flights of beer or kombucha.

Participating restaurants include: Crust, Floriana’s, Fun Bowl, The Pilot House, Quanto Basta Italian Eatery, YoSake, Blue Surf Cafe, Henry’s, Hop’s Supply Company, Might As Well, Panacea Brewing Company, Wrightsville Beach Brewery, Bluewater, Brasserie du Soleil, East Oceanfront, Oceanic, Oceans at Holiday Inn, South Beach Grill, Waterman’s Brewing, Churrasco, Osteria Cicchetti, and Ogden Tap Room.

“We’re excited to be participating in restaurant week again this year,” Shelley Musleh, Osteria Cicchetti’s general manager, said.

Restaurant week originally was founded in Wilmington by encore magazine in 2009. Over the years, it expanded into Wrightsville Beach and even Pleasure Island. Port City Daily re-envisioned the entity once it became aware restaurant week wouldn’t continue under encore’s branding any longer.

Urban Food Group, which runs Osteria Cicchetti, Brasserie du Soleil and Boca Bay, participates annually. Though this year Boca Bay will sit out Port City Taste, as it is undergoing renovations.

“It’s a wonderful opportunity to introduce customers not familiar with our restaurant to our wonderful food and service,” Musleh said. “Hopefully, their positive experience will incentivize them to become repeat customers.”

Also returning to restaurant week is YoSake, owned by Justin Smith who also operates the restaurant Anne Bonnys (closed through February) and Dram + Morsel, located above YoSake.

“We have been using Dram as additional seating for YoSake during the pandemic,” Smith said. “It was easier to plan and give customers the necessary space to eat [considering social-distance protocols].”

Port City Taste allows diners to enjoy old standbys and new places at great values not offered throughout the year.

“Hopefully, folks can try something different or have their favorite meal that they might not have otherwise,” Smith said.

It’s easy to participate in Port City Taste: Diners can peruse the menus — and can print them out and tack them to the ‘fridge — call up their friends, and head to any participating eatery between Jan. 25-Feb. 7 to dine in or take away the food. Just say you’re there for Port City Taste and eat local, live better!

Jason Moorehead appeared with his attorney on CNN Saturday to defend himself in an interview with host Michael Smerconish.

Moorehead said he’s been suspended with pay while the district investigates his activities on Jan. 6. He added he was only in Washington to hear then-President Donald Trump speak and to witness firsthand the rally opposing Congress’ certification of President Joe Biden’s election victory last November. The rally was followed by rioters storming the Capitol, leaving five people dead and scores of pro-Trump supporters facing criminal charges.

“Did you break any laws while you were there?” asked Smerconish, a former Philadelphia newspaper columnist who rose to fame as a syndicated radio commentator.

“No. Period,” Moorehead said alongside attorney Francis Malofiy. “I was there just observing firsthand to be a witness to a historic day and never was within a mile of the riot that happened and which I didn’t know about until much later. We walked around the Washington Monument, tried to get close to the White House, ate a hot dog and went back to the bus.”

CNN introduced Moorehead as a Pennsylvania social studies teacher “suspended for attending the protest.” The Allentown School District announced Jan. 8, without naming Moorehead, that he had been “temporarily relieved of his teaching duties” after being “involved in the Electoral College protest that took place at the United States Capitol Building.”

District’s Solicitor John Freund on Saturday told lehighvalleylive.com: “As previously stated the teacher has been temporarily reassigned while the district investigates the facts of his involvement in the January 6 the incident in Washington. A temporary reassignment away from teaching duties while the district investigates the underlying facts is standard procedure with any teacher whose conduct is under question. The teacher has not lost any pay or benefits. When the investigation is complete a decision will be made concerning his return to the classroom.”

Smerconish pushed Moorehead for comment on a social media posting in which the teacher could be seen wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap and carrying an American flag, with the caption, “Doing my civic duty!” In another post, he commented, “This,” in reference to the Capitol’s being insured.

“I want to be clear, I wasn’t mocking BLM or Antifa with that post,” Moorehead said of the latter post. “I was trying to highlight what I believe is the double standard that often exists in the media when they’re looking at two different events from two different political groups.”

Moorehead hasn’t heard from the district to share his side of the events that day, Malofiy said.

“They should be aware I was never near that building, never part of anything illegal or violent and I’m currently waiting for them to do the right thing, to reinstate me and ideally offer a full apology absolving me of any wrongdoing because my reputation and character has been destroyed,” Moorehead said.

Added Malofiy: “The thing here is that the school district without asking this teacher’s position, a teacher who’s had 17 years of impeccable performance, who cares about his students, without asking his position as to where he was and then blasting him with a press statement that said he was at the Capitol building protest is absolutely false. It implies that he was violently protesting and was not part of a peaceful event, which he was part of. And to never correct that statement after they learned that he was nowhere near the Capitol building protest but over a mile away is defamatory and has destroyed his life.

“We talk about diversity of people, but we have forgotten diversity of speech, thought and opinion. In public schools, there needs to be critical thinking that can only happen if two sides are represented and you can endorse a political movement to the exclusion of another, otherwise it violates the First Amendment. And we’re here going to fight for this teacher who for 17 years gave his life to helping others.”

516,517,https://island.lk/planters-decry-mob-violence-on-park-estate-demands-swift-legal-action-against-perpetrators/,"The Planters’ Association of Ceylon (PA) condemned what it called the “shocking violence instigated by CWC Member of Parliament M. Rameshwaran at Park Estate in Kandapola on January 17, 2021”, which damaged property and left a Trainee Assistant Superintendent in hospital.

The Association called for an impartial investigation and swift justice following the brutal mob attack which resulted in the Trainee Assistant Superintendent being admitted to the Nuwara Eliya General Hospital. The victim of the assault was reported to have received severe injuries and was undergoing respiratory difficulties as a result of the assault perpetrated against him by a mob that was transported from outside of the region in two buses facilitated by the MP Rameshwaran, the PA claimed in a statement on behalf of all 21 Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) in the country.

The PA also called for further investigations to ascertain the extent of damage done to the Estate Manager’s Bungalow and grounds – all of which are classified as state property of significant historical value.

“The conduct of the MP is utterly disgraceful and totally unacceptable from any citizen, let alone a duly elected representative of the people of Sri Lanka. We call on law enforcement authorities to uphold the rule of law and take swift action to ensure that the perpetrators of the brutal attack are immediately arrested, charged for their violent and illegal actions, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” the PA said.

The attack took place following a phone call made by the MP Rameshwaran to the Estate Superintendent wherein he (the MP) demanded an immediate meeting on Sunday, January 17, 2021 around 5.30 pm. The Estate Superintendent had calmly and politely suggested an alternate date, given that he was on leave at the time and was driving to Kandy to urgently purchase essential cancer medication for his father in-law, the statement continued.

Dissatisfied with the response, the MP had launched a crude verbal assault against the Estate Superintendent, who had then hung up. Thereafter, the Rameshwaran coerced workers at the estate to give him the Estate Superintendent’s wife’s number, whom he also verbally abused, which was unbecoming of an MP. This phone call had multiple witnesses, the statement asserted.

Subsequently, MP Rameshwaran, together with the Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman travelled directly to the estate in two buses full of people from outside the region to gather a mob and incite them to violence. At around 5.30 pm, the MP forcibly and unlawfully entered the bungalow premises with the mob., it further said.

A young Trainee Assistant Superintendent in the premises at the time had tried to de-escalate the tense situation, but was brutally assaulted by the mob led by the MP. Following the vicious assault, the MP and his thugs prevented anyone from entering or exiting the premises. Instead they unlawfully detained those present, including the assault victim who was denied any medical attention or assistance for at least five hours after the assault took place, it said.

Following the intervention of the Police Special Task Force and local police, the Trainee Assistant Superintendent was finally removed from the premises under armed escort and immediately transported to the Nuwara Eliya base hospital where he remains hospitalized at present. As a result of the grievous assault, the victim is still recovering from severe contusions and suffering from respiratory distress and other multiple injuries, it added.

Meanwhile, the MP and the mob continued the unauthorized and unlawful occupation of the bungalow premises for over 24 hours, burned rubber tires, damaged building structures, and also compelled workers from the estate, as well as surrounding estates of the company to stage a strike – resulting in loss of wages to workers and revenue to the company, the PA said.

“At a time when RPC’s are making every possible endeavour to keep the industry and the national economy afloat by managing the estates in a manner that safeguard the livelihood of the plantation community, such random violent incidents have undone a lot of our efforts, and will ultimately hurt the workers most”, the PA further noted.

“This is true financially, but in the context of a global pandemic, the foolish actions of MP have also seriously increased the risk of COVID transmission in the very communities he is supposed to represent. While RPCs had taken every possible measure to protect them from these risks, the conduct of the MP may have severely compromised their safety”, it said.

“This is utterly inexcusable, in addition to being totally illegal. He must not be allowed to break the law with impunity. We hope that his standing as a Member of Parliament will not be an impediment to him being brought to justice,” the PA added.

Asked for comment on the incident, Rameshwaran said he was busy at a meeting and to call later.","Planters decry mob-violence on Park Estate, demands swift legal action against perpetrators",island.lk
517,518,https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2561824/rogue-ones-alan-tudyk-reveals-the-tricky-aspect-of-shooting-the-star-wars-film,"As the Star Wars universe has expanded exponentially in the past five years, it’s especially been a joy to meet other droids of all walks of life as they assist or disarm the various characters we’ve met in the franchise. Although Taika Waititi’s IG-11 may be giving him a run for his Imperial credits, Rogue One’s K-2SO is also a favorite, played by Firefly’s immensely talented Alan Tudyk. The actor and voice talent is one of the sassier droids in the galaxy and an absolute highlight of Gareth Edwards’ spinoff, which as actually proved to be a somewhat ""tricky"" experience for Tudyk.

Since Star Wars is so beloved to so many people, it’s not an easy task Disney has taken upon itself by building the series out beyond the Skywalkers. But Rogue One was an early indication that audiences welcome new adventures and characters to fill in the timeline gaps or create new ones. Alan Tudyk talked more about the making of the film with these words:

I definitely look back on it fondly. It was a challenge, in that the script was changing at a certain point.... There was a certain point early on where the story shifted. A new writer was brought in and things were changed. And so, I had met Jyn Erso’s character one way, and they even used it in the trailers where I say, ‘Hello, Cassian said you are a friend. I will not kill you.’ And people, when I would go to Comic-Cons would say, ‘Could you write that?’ I’m like, ‘It’s not in the movie, that quote!’ It was just an early version of how I met Jyn Erso. So things changed.We were on set and we’d be like, ‘Ok so this scene is after we’ve met? Or before? Oh, we just met in a new scene that happened.’ So that’s tough. That’s tricky. That can shake your faith.

Star Wars films have grown more complicated these days with Disney’s hands more actively in the mix to keep the machine rolling and on the up-and-up with fans. Fans were initially worried about some behind-the-scenes reshoots for Rogue One that were completed following the film’s principal photography, done largely by Tony Gilroy instead of Gareth Edwards.

But in working with Gareth Edwards, I love working with him. And Diego Luna is a lot of fun. There were a lot of pictures on set, like from on set, pictures that I got to see, and there’s a lot of me and Diego, and I’m laughing. I’m just laughing my ass off a lot. And we went to Maldives! ... And we went to Jordan! So we were flying all these places before they had built the thing they built for Mandalorian, where you go to Long Beach and you can be anywhere! You’re surrounded by all those screens. We were actually flying to places and doing the whole filmmaking thing, and waking up at whatever time in the morning to hook up with some Bedouins so they could take us to this one place that we could overlook to see Jedi. Seeing Stormtroopers on actual camels, and they’re like, 'Eh, we’re gonna fix the camels later!' That stuff was magic, man. Magic.

It sounds like a really incredible experience. What’s great about Alan Tudyk’s role is he did get to be on set and play off Diego Luna’s Cassian Andor and the rest of the cast, even though CGI chiefly brought the droid to life. The cast has likened working on that movie to what George Lucas would have done with a lot of palpable sets. Felicity Jones called the experience “visceral” and “naturalistic” while recently reflecting on it herself.

As of right now though, Alan Tudyk's K-2SO is not expected to be part of the upcoming television follow-up to Rogue One that will see Diego Luna reprise his role as Cassian Andor for Andor. That show is set to follow the character’s life before the events of the 2016 film.

Multiple far-left media zealots have in recent days called for Fox News and other conservative outlets to be permanently censored and silenced.

One of these zealots, Washington Post columnist and CNN analyst Max Boot, went so far as to equate Fox News with “foreign terrorist groups” and demand that President Joe Biden revive the now-defunct fairness doctrine to accomplish the job.

“[T]he United Kingdom doesn’t have its own version of Fox News, because it has a government regulator that metes out hefty fines to broadcasters that violate minimal standards of impartiality and accuracy. The United States hasn’t had that since the Federal Communications Commission stopped enforcing the ‘fairness’ doctrine in the 1980s. As president, Biden needs to reinvigorate the FCC.”

Another of the zealots, radically anti-freedom, anti-liberty zealot Anand Giridharadas of MSNBC, challenged the idea that networks like Fox should even be allowed to exist and called a new, “broader” Fairness Doctrine to be created.

The fairness doctrine was a Federal Communications Commission policy that had ostensibly been designed to force broadcasters to present information in a fair and balanced manner by featuring both sides of every issue.

Except that rarely happened. Instead, the liberal narrative dominated the airways. Thus, not until the Reagan administration’s elimination of the policy in 1987 was conservative media really able to emerge on the scene and begin telling its side of the story.

Regardless, according to National Review senior political correspondent Jim Geraghty, the idea of reviving the fairness doctrine makes no sense.

For one, he wrote this week, the fairness doctrine only applied to broadcast networks, not cable networks like Fox.

For another, the doctrine was jettisoned in 1987 specifically because the FCC had determined that it “was stifling discussion of current events instead of facilitating it.” And given the current climate, less meaningful discussion is the last thing Americans need.

Likewise, the notion of creating a new “broader” fairness doctrine targeting not only speech on cable but speech on the Internet as well would meanwhile be a clear violation of the 1949 court decision Terminiello v. City of Chicago.

In the decision, Justice William Douglas decreed that “freedom of speech, though not absolute … is nevertheless protected against censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest.”

“There is no room under our Constitution for a more restrictive view. For the alternative would lead to standardization of ideas either by legislatures, courts, or dominant political or community groups.”

Of course, the “standardization of ideas” is exactly what leftists like Boot and Giridharadas seek, in that they want to return to a media environment where only the leftist worldview of society and news is ever purveyed.

As once noted by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, “Reinstating the Fairness Doctrine would essentially turn talk radio into PBS, restoring a virtual monopoly to the major liberal media.”

Speaking on this same issue back in 2018, conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh imagined the thoughts that go through the minds of leftists like Boot and Giridharadas.

“If we had Walter Cronkite back, there wouldn’t be Rush Limbaugh; there wouldn’t be anybody to criticize us. There wouldn’t be Fox News out there criticizing us,” he said.

He then added in his own voice, “This is what they want, folks. They’re telegraphing what they’re gonna do if they win. They’re setting up a one-party everything. Good-bye, individual liberty and freedom on everything. This is drastic!”

The good news is that the chances of this happening are extremely low thanks to the judicial picks of President Donald Trump, who was responsible for installing conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

“[T]his current Supreme Court is very, very, very likely to find FCC restrictions on what Fox News Channel or any other news channel says to be a blatant and galling violation of the First Amendment,” Geraghty noted in his column.",'Should Fox News be allowed to exist?'

524,525,https://artdaily.com/news/132316/Nils-St--230-rk-presents-an-exhibition-of-works-by-Jone-Kvie,"There is 2,099 km between Naples and the north-western district of Copenhagen  a twenty-two hour journey for an able driver. But a rock would require as many million years to travel the same distance to the gallery spaces in Copenhagen. Rocks operate with their own particular chronology, which is why working them up artistically always ends as a permanent monument to the impermanence of civilisation. Contrary to rocks which, at their own sedimentary speed, are constantly on the move, you and I are definitely here just now. It can be an overwhelming experience to be faced with nature and equally hard to describe the experience associated with it. In the same way, it takes time to take in the various elements of Jone Kvies latest exhibition. 

 

The point of departure for his new works is a metamorphosed encounter between geology, industry, and Western sculptural history. It is a pragmatic union of readily recognisable elements which reemerge in a new, but also somewhat homeless form after being worked up by Kvie. They are like entropic deformities, marginalised by man  dissolved by nature. Earlier in his practice, he examined a figurative perception of astronomy; especially the moon as a motif, star clusters, and other visible objects in the sky which, for centuries, have been guiding mans self-perception and navigation systems. Paradoxically, the moon and stars might be easier to relate to as popular pictorial references than nature in its pure and abstract form. Possibly because modern man, over time, has become alienated to nature. 

 

The central point in the exhibition is the very heavy marble block with an hourglass-like figure cut in onyx. Classical sculpture traditions of the ancient world were formed around marble and onyx. The name onyx derives from the Greek word for claw or fingernail due to its similarity to the keratinised sheet found on the outer limbs of humans and animals. Both marble and onyx are the results of transformative processes lasting millions of years and, just like the human body, they carry with them accumulations of time. In this way, Kvies work extends from the geological processes of his materials. The onyx figure functions as a marker in the exhibition, possibly referring to time as an abstract dimension. Kvies choice of material is never insignificant nor accidental, but always applied thoughtfully and strategically. In the exhibition what comes after certainty, he presents universal and abstract issues which have absorbed mankind since time immemorial  it is a contemplative examination which always takes its beginning in the material. 

 

Jone Kvie was born in Stavanger, Norway, in 1971, alternately living and working in Berlin and Naples. In 2019, Stavanger Art Museum showed his largest solo exhibition to date, Here, here, where Kvies recent works were shown in relation to earlier works from the beginning of 2000. Kvies newest book of the same name was published in connection with the exhibition and contains texts by Milena Høgsberg, Magnus af Petersén, and Jimmie Durham. 

 

Kvie has shown at a number of museums in Scandinavia including ARoS Aarhus Art Museum (Aarhus), the Museum of Contemporary Art (Oslo), KODE Art Museum, Bergen, Gothenburg Museum of Art, and Stavanger Art Museum. He has executed both private and public decorative commissions for e.g. Oslo Airport (Oslo), the Telenor Headquarters (Oslo), Designhögskolan (Umeå) and Storting (the Norwegian parliament) in Oslo. He is represented in museum collections in Scandinavia and internationally, for instance the American University Museum (Washington DC), ARoS Aarhus Art Museum (Aarhus), the Arts Council Norway, KODE Art Museum (Bergen), Gothenburg Museum of Art, the Public Art Agency Sweden, Stavanger Art Museum, and the National Museum of Contemporary Art (Oslo).",Nils Stærk presents an exhibition of works by Jone Kvie,artdaily.com

526,527,https://www.compsmag.com/news/hacking/top-cybersecurity-firm-fireeye-says-nation-state-is-culprit/,"If one of the biggest names in cybersecurity can be broken, what chance does an average person have against hackers?

That’s a likely question after high-profile cybersecurity firm FireEye said earlier this week that hackers breached its network and stole the toolkit it uses to investigate customers’ systems to find weaknesses.

The hack was carried out “by a country with the highest level of attack capabilities,” FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia said in a statement Tuesday. blog post. The company is investigating the incident, as are the Federal Bureau of Investigation and companies such as Microsoft.

Mandia said there is no sign that the hackers used the stolen tools, nor is there any evidence that customer information has been stolen, Mandia said. FireEye has developed more than 300 measures against the tools for use by customers and the cybersecurity community.

Google: Expulsion of top AI researcher draws sharp, new research into how it treats black workers

Disney +: Streaming service has a price increase from $ 1 to $ 7.99 in March

The hackers “were mainly looking for information related to certain government customers, ”Mandia said in the statement, without mentioning them by name.

Milpitas, California-based FireEye, which is publicly traded, has more than 9,600 customers worldwide, including more than 1,000 government and law enforcement agencies.

The company, a major global cybersecurity player, has responded to breaches at Sony and Equifax in the past and helped Saudi Arabia thwart a cyber attack in the oil industry.

Russian spies are likely to blame for the offense

The cybersecurity company has not identified a perpetrator, but the Russian SVR intelligence agency is said to have committed the breach, The Washington Post reported. This is the same Russian spy agency that hacked into the Democratic National Committee in 2015 and was accused of stealing research data from COVID-19 vaccines, The Post reported.

“Preliminary clues show an actor with a high level of sophistication in accordance with a nation-state,” Matt Gorham, deputy director of the FBI’s cyber division, told The Post.

The hack was the biggest blow to the US cybersecurity community since a mysterious group known as the “Shadow Brokers” released a wealth of high-level hacking tools in 2016 that had been stolen from the National Security Agency.

How did this happen?

Hacks will happen, especially with increased activity from bad actors during the coronavirus pandemic.

FireEye’s Mandia said this attack is different in that “the attackers have adapted their world-class capabilities specifically to attack and attack FireEye. … They operated clandestinely and used methods that counteract security tools and forensics. They used a new combination of techniques that we or our partners had not seen in the past. “

Among the tools provided to the hackers were techniques known as “domain fronting,” the widespread use of domains belonging to popular brands, in this case Microsoft, The New York Times, and USA TODAY.

The strategy here is for hackers to assume that networks will not deny access to heavily trafficked people sites. Thus, an email addressed from usatoday.com or nytimes.com containing malware can infiltrate and infect a network.

FireEye’s exercises, conducted by the “Red Team,” would send Internet traffic to the US disguised as coming from The New York Times of USA TODAY, but never “actually passed through the domains of any of these companies,” the company said in a statement. statement to the US. TODAY.

“We didn’t ask for permission in advance from the news outlets, nor would we normally ask for permission for this type of use, because we don’t use traffic or send it to their own infrastructure or use their brands commercially. It’s only the limited targeting of specific users at our client for security assessment purposes, ”said FireEye. “We’ve been in touch with both the New York Times and USA Today after Tuesday’s announcement and have informed them about our use of this particular tool.

Other recent counterfeit brands used in ransomware attacks include Amazon, Apple, UPS and Zoom.

How important is it?

This isn’t the first time a cybersecurity company has been targeted, and the results “could have a long-term effect on organizations around the world,” said Ilia Sotnikov, vice president of product management at cybersecurity software vendor Netwrix. “This attack could also make advanced attack tools and techniques available to a wider population of less sophisticated cyber criminals.”

Corporate cybersecurity teams should “take immediate advantage of FireEye’s countermeasures,” and be alert for additional security updates, he said. “This attack is further proof that a motivated hacker will be able to endanger any organization, no matter how well protected it is. Our new normal right now is to be open about a data breach and own the message like FireEye did. “

FireEye’s “actions are commendable,” tweeted Grady Summers, executive vice president for products for SailPoint, a provider of identity security software. Summers, who previously worked at FireEye, responded in a series of tweets to online criticism of FireEye.

“I think it would be fair to say that this breach – if it were never made public – would not have passed the reporting threshold due to negative financial consequences,” Summers said. “I believe FireEye did this because their leadership team, starting with Kevin, is ethically in their DNA – and they care more about customers and the community than the short-term impact on the stock price.”

And the breach likely won’t hurt FireEye’s competitiveness, he said. “They will rebuild their tool set and not miss a beat.”

What are average people to do?

The good news for the average person is that the threat to them is low – be glad you’re a small fish in a big cyber sea – but the threat to businesses or government agencies where they work is greater.

Since more Americans started working from home during the coronavirus pandemic, the likelihood of internal actions – including accidental lapses – has led to an increase in cyber security incidents, Netwrix found.

While on the job, employees should remember to follow the company’s cybersecurity advice. “These tools primarily use enterprise systems, but it’s a great reminder for everyone to make sure they keep their personal devices, apps, and software up to date,” said Jerry Gamblin, director of security research at Kenna Security, which tells companies helps monitor and manage cyber risks.

“This includes downloading and installing updates for the phones, tablets and computers that each family member uses,” said Gamblin.

People should focus on cybersecurity, especially creating strong passwords and not using them for different services, Microsoft said in a September report citing more sophisticated phishing campaigns.

“If you have a device with a password, you have to assume that at some point it has been or will be compromised,” said Nate Fick, general manager of data security company Elastic.

Users should regularly change passwords – don’t use the same one for multiple accounts – and sign up for multi-factor authentication, which usually sends you a text or email to sign in, he said.

“Every consumer should be concerned when they read about a widespread security breach, especially when the culprit is identified as a nation-state and where the target has sophisticated defense, as in this case,” said Fick. “A common philosophy among security professionals is to accept a compromise and then act on it.”

527,528,https://www.trtworld.com/africa/deadly-pirate-ambush-on-turkish-cargo-ship-off-guinea-sailors-kidnapped-43521,"One crew member has been killed and 15 others kidnapped when pirates stormed a Turkish cargo ship that had a crew of 19 off the coast of Guinea, according to a statement.

According to a written statement by David Johnson, head of EOS Risk Group, the ship, named M/V Mozart, which was travelling from Lagos to Cape Town, was sailing 100 sea miles northwest of the African island country Sao Tome when pirates boarded the ship.

Fifteen crew members moving from Lagos, Nigeria to Cape Town, South Africa were kidnapped, one was killed, while three remained onboard, David Johnson, the head of the UK-based EOS Risk Group said in the statement.

The crew member who was killed was an Azerbaijani sailor.

A tape recording shared on Twitter and believed to be belonging to the 4th captain of the ship says: ""I don't know where I'm going. The pirates dismantled all cables, nothing is working. Only the navigator works. They gave me a route, I'm moving accordingly.""

According to Turkey's Communications Directorate, President Erdogan held two phone conversations with Furkan Yaren, the 4th captain in the ship.

Erdogan was told that the ship is sailing toward Gabon with three crew members inside.

Erdogan also stated that he is closely following the situation.

According to information obtained from diplomatic sources, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu spoke to Yaren and received information from him regarding the incident and situation in the ship.

Cavusoglu also spoke to the business manager of the company the ship belong to and offered condolences and assured him that steps necessary to rescue the kidnapped crew will be taken.

The foreign minister also offered condolences to Azerbaijani FM Jeyhun Bayramov for the death of the Azerbaijani citizen.

Cavusoglu told him that when the ship lands at the port, they will transfer the Azerbaijani sailor's body home.

Turkey mobilised all means through its embassies in the region to rescue the kidnapped crew.

Kidnappings and piracy for ransom in Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea are common. A similar attack occurred in 2019 when a Turkish cargo ship was attacked by Nigerian pirates, and 10 sailors, all Turkish nationals, were taken hostage for ransom. Later, all sailors were released.","Deadly pirate ambush on Turkish cargo ship off Guinea, sailors kidnapped",www.trtworld.com

According to the sheriff’s department, McClung was being held at the Fayette County Jail on two pending cases that were unrelated to Pflum’s disappearance. He was not able to post bail. Towards the end of his life, he reached out to Joey Laughlin, a Fayette County Sheriff to discuss the case.

At the time of the recorded video interview in July, McClung confessed to killing Pflum but did not provide a location of her remains or information that would lead detectives to find her, according to the sheriff’s department.

When McMillin asked him if his previous confession was accurate, McClung told him it was not, saying he did it “because they offered [him] $25,000 and to get out of there with his family.”

The sheriff’s department said McMillin “insinuated to the Prosecutor’s Office and Sheriff that more detail would be forthcoming and that it would be shocking.” They did not receive any official statements. After McClung’s death, they say McMillin did provide an audio recording of McClung recanting his confession.

“It is the understanding of our offices that Mr. McMillin is now withholding a statement from a potential witness that has also not been turned over to investigators or prosecutors as of this release,” said the sheriff’s department in a statement.

“It is unfortunate that Mr. McClung made false statements to investigators that likely brought about a fleeting hope of closure for the Pflum family. Yet, under the circumstances, where Mr. McClung’s days were dwindling, his statements appear to be nothing more than a desperate attempt to live his last few days on this earth as a free man.

“No words can adequately express the heartfelt sorrow that I have for the Pflum family; nor can they express my unreserved hope that they one day find peace. My job is to defend the liberty of the accused, in order to make sure that the innocent is not wrongfully convicted. Based on my own private conversations with Mr. McClung, and his overall lack of credibility, I believe the person responsible for the death or disappearance of Denise Pflum is still out there.

“I sincerely hope that the investigation into the alleged death and disappearance of Denise Pflum continues, and I pledge to offer my support to assist in the continued investigation in any way possible. The last thing that Denise Pflum and her family deserve is to have this investigation stop, when the real perpetrator may very well still be out there, or someone might have information that can truly solve this case.”

“The Fayette County Prosecutor’s Office and Fayette County Sheriff’s Department have worked diligently and tirelessly on the Denise Pflum case and continue to do so. We understand that the community takes great interest in the case and care deeply about finding the answers to Denise’s disappearance. Our top priority is finding the truth and finally allowing the Pflum family to have the answers they have been searching for over 30 years. We continue to be hopeful that we will also be able to find justice for Denise Pflum,” said the sheriff’s office in a statement.",New questions emerge about confession made in 1986 cold case,www.wthr.com

On Friday, by a slim margin of 15 to 14, the St. Louis Board of Aldermen endorsed the program, directing it to the mayor's desk for final approval.

""Aerial surveillance is a war on cold blooded murder,"" said Alderman John Collins-Muhammad. ""We have to do something unconventional and bold and the same arguments were hearing right now we heard when we funded cure violence.""



But the plan isn't without controversy. Opponents say the use of this surveillance system infringes on civil liberties.

In a stunning disregard for civil liberties, President Reed was the crucial 15th vote in favor of deploying spy planes through a contract that every lawyer on the board and our City Counselor took serious issue with. 



Our citizens deserve a real public safety plan. https://t.co/kDmYlhs6Ke — Cara Spencer (@CaraSpencerSTL) January 22, 2021

""I don't think it works because you can't trust the police or anyone to be spying on citizens and that's just history it's not like I made it up,"" said Alderman Jesse Todd.



""You don't have any privacy... you have none, the buildings that you live in have cameras that you don't even know about,"" said Alderwoman Marlene Davis.



Others believe there's simply not enough information to move forward with the measure.



""We don't have the department of public safety, the police chief on record as endorsing this as a measure that they have faith in,"" said Alderwoman Heather Navarro.

To get a better understanding, 5 On Your Side spoke with the program's founder Ross McNutt.



""So we fly aircrafts over a city with cameras that we built that take a Google Earth like image and it's updated every second,"" McNutt said.



He showed us how the planes were used in Baltimore.



""We get where they went to on their first stop, we get from their first to where they stopped to get gas where they went all over the incident where they ended up,"" he said.



McNutt says the suspects they tracked here eventually pled guilty.



""Ultimately this doesn't get to the root issues of crime, the root causes of crime,"" said Alderman Bret Narayan.",Aerial surveillance plan moves one step closer to reality in St. Louis,www.ksdk.com
530,531,https://www.bizpacreview.com/2021/01/23/we-gotta-look-in-the-mirror-maher-warns-left-they-cant-use-trump-as-scapegoat-anymore-1020424/,"HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday warned that now that the left has gotten rid of Trump, they can’t blame everything on him anymore. He says we’ll ‘find out’ in the next 100 days if Trump was really ‘the bad guy’ during the pandemic.

During Maher’s panel-discussion segment, he referenced recent violence in Portland, OR, and Seattle by left-wing groups including Antifa, emphasizing it was the political left that was “breaking windows” following President Biden’s inauguration instead of the right.

“It does feel like the whole Trump administration just sort of disappeared, like we lived through a fever dream,” said Vanity Fair contributor Peter Hamby during the mid-show roundtable. Maher agreed, comparing the current situation to the “Who Shot J.R.” episode of ‘Dallas.’

The segment started off with Hamby blaming “Trumpism” for “infecting every state capital.” Maher’s other guest, “The Fifth Column” podcast co-host Kmele Foster, proceeded to aggressively and logically push back.

“I just want to try to put it into another context,” Foster said, “that what we’ve seen here over the course of the last, say, 10-12 months is actually a bit of an unraveling; this escalation in political violence that is not limited to the right, but existed on the left as well.

“We saw $2 billion worth of damage done over the course of several months. We saw days of civil unrest in the street. We saw federal buildings surrounded, held under siege for days at a time,” he continued. “This is the United States of America and we have seen a steady increase in the regularity of political violence in this country.

“And if there is a broader trend, as opposed to a specific movement that is broken,” he said, “then we’re talking about too narrow a problem as opposed to the right problem. It might be a really major defect in our policy.”

“There’s always been an anarchist, black bloc gutter punk element on the left,” countered Hamby. “But Trumpism has infected every state capitol. It is everywhere.”

“We were promised armed rebellion at every state capitol,” interjected Foster, indicating that those rebellions were not pervasive. “Which is why I’m worried we may be miscasting this. We’re thinking: It’s Trump. Trump is the problem. We saw hundreds of people in the street breaking windows after Biden won. Something is wrong. And I’m worried we’re not talking about this in the right way.”

“Now we can’t blame everything on him,” Maher stated concerning Trump.

“When folks talk about Black Lives Matter, it’s often said that, ‘Look, this is just an ethical statement. If you can’t acknowledge this, then that’s a real problem.’ Black Lives Matter is a political statement and there is a political program attached to it,” said Foster. “And plenty of people broadly may not be aware of it. The fact that it does have some roots in Marxism, that there are radical elements of the Black Lives Matter movement that are very disinclined towards free markets and capitalism, that challenge very basic notions that I think are broadly shared by Americans. Like equality under the law, for example. This pivot toward equity and a focus on racial outcomes is something that is rather new but seems to have taken the country by storm.

“Yes,” said Foster. “Quite frankly, talking about racism all the time is not a solution.”

Maher took it up and said, “That’s a great question to get to… Now that we’ve gotten rid of Trump, we’re faced with this problem as Americans. Now we can’t blame everything on him. Now we gotta look in the mirror and we’ll find out in the next hundred days, like, if it was all Trump who was the bad guy.”

“I’ve said from the beginning with the virus, he certainly played his part horribly, horribly beginning with getting that little team out of China that could’ve stopped the whole f—in thing to begin with, but it’s also, I think, on the American medical establishment that never told the American people the best way you can handle this is get yourself in better shape, get your immune system better, stop eating s— food and sugar and day drinking. They never had the guts to do that. They wouldn’t even say the word ‘obesity’ on television. That would be fat-shaming. The code is now ‘precondition.'”

Maher then wondered “can we do s— anymore” as Americans, citing the disastrous coronavirus vaccine rollout, “even if we can’t blame Trump.” He snarked that the only bipartisan things the country is good at are “printing money” and “bombing” other countries.

“I think you’re absolutely right, Bill,” Foster agreed. “The profound failure of this entire government, the bureaucracy, Democrats and Republicans alike to actually rise up to the occasion and meet this challenge of COVID, they failed profoundly and the question of what we do from here is the most important question that we ought to be pondering and we don’t have Trump to kick around.”",'We gotta look in the mirror': Maher warns left they can't use Trump as scapegoat anymore,www.bizpacreview.com

532,533,https://artdaily.com/news/132308/Edward-Burns-returns-to-Long-Island-with--Bridge-and-Tunnel-,"Edward Burns has carved a distinctive path as an indie filmmaker in the quarter-century since he made a splash with his debut, The Brothers McMullen. He has consistently made movies for small ($250,000 for Looking for Kitty) to minuscule ($9,000  yes, you read that right  for Newlyweds) budgets, and was experimenting with new distribution models even before the rise of streaming. In 2007, he made the first straight-to-iTunes movie, Purple Violets, and in 2010, he inaugurated Comcasts straight-to-VOD Indie Film Club with Nice Guy Johnny. 

 

Now, he sees a bright future for indie filmmakers  I dont know if you can call us that anymore, but were independent-minded storytellers  in streaming and premium cable. 

 

These are the perfect platforms, and its one of the most encouraging times for someone with a story to tell, Burns said. 

 

While he previously ventured into broadcast and basic cable television for short-lived series like Public Morals, his new dramedy Bridge and Tunnel, premiering Sunday on Epix, marks his entry into premium cable. 

 

Burns said Epix was looking for a half-hour show full of promise and joy as a departure from the darker themes of many prestige TV series. His tonal model for Bridge and Tunnel was the early Beatles hits that put a smile on your face without being cornball-ish, he added. We do need that now. 

 

Set in 1980 in Valley Stream, New York, the Long Island town where Burns grew up, the show revolves around six recent college graduates as they try to figure out their futures. That period when youve been away for four years and youre back in your house with your parents  for some people its a week, for some its a couple of years  and youre not quite an adult, but no longer a kid, is really interesting to me, Burns said. 

 

Burns, who also plays the father of Jimmy (Sam Vartholomeos), an aspiring photographer, includes plenty of period flourishes. A poster of Mets fan favorite Rusty Staub can be glimpsed on the wall of Jimmys childhood room, and Burns lent his own vintage 1960s Mets jersey to Brian Muller, who plays Pags. One character makes a commercial thats an homage to pitchman Crazy Eddie, a New York TV fixture in the 80s; if theres a second season, Burns hopes to have another character appear in one of the Milford Plaza Hotel Lullaby of Broadway ads that ran endlessly back then. 

 

Burns recently spoke by phone about Bridge and Tunnel and what he had to do to keep it alive during the pandemic. (The show was shot on Long Island last summer and fall.) These are edited excerpts from the conversation. 

 

Q: As a Mets fan, I loved the snippet of a game with Bob Murphy announcing, but why not make this 1984 so we see Dwight Gooden pitching, instead of a Met fouling out? 

 

A: I settled on the summer of 1980 because its the era in New York Im most nostalgic about. People talk about Paris in the 1920s  I always thought about New York in the early 80s. You have punk, new wave, hip-hop, the art and fashion scene. When I finally come into Manhattan in 90, 91, you look back and say, Oh man, it had to be so much cooler then. 

 

Im 52, so in 1980 Im in sixth grade and at my most impressionable. I romanticized the lives and escapades of the older guys and girls in my neighborhood  I could only imagine what they were doing when they were walking down my street to the train station on a Friday or Saturday night, going into the city to do their thing. 

 

I fell in love with the idea of these bridge and tunnel kids who make their journey into Manhattan to pursue their dreams. Its the Scott Fitzgerald line about the city and its wild promise. I gave each character a dream that for a working class kid really seems out of touch  I didnt know anyone who was in the arts, in fashion or photography, so it felt like an impossible dream for my friends who had artistic ambitions. But you also felt if you could get into Manhattan, you could make your dreams happen. 

 

I also wanted to embrace how we communicated before we were locked to our phones and had access to the entire world through social media. I loved those simple pleasures  the great nights were sitting on your car on your street corner having a couple of beers, or hanging with your dad in the backyard and watching the Mets, which, admittedly, in 1980 wouldnt be a great night. 

 

Q: Theres a vintage soundtrack, with bands ranging from Toto to Blondie, and music is a constant topic of conversation. But why no mention of Billy Joel, the ultimate Long Island star? Glass Houses was a number one album in 1980. 

 

 

 

Mira Furlan, actress on 'Lost' and 'Babylon 5,' dies at 65 

 

 

 

A: As a young guy, I once saw Billy Joel outside a pizza place, and when he got into his car, my friends and I followed him. So Im keeping Billy Joel and that scene in my back pocket for Season 2. 

 

Q: Pags, who loves Styx, gets belittled by his sister, a huge Clash fan. Did you worry you were stacking the deck too much in her favor? 

 

A: I have a soft spot in my heart for Styx. Paradise Theatre came out when I was in eighth grade  if you were in 10th grade, maybe you said, Absolutely not, but for us it was a big album. I still know guys who are so pissed that Styx is not in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, they are completely blinded by their love for the band. I wanted Pags to represent those true Styx fans. 

 

Q: Your characters are working class but mostly went to college and have bigger ambitions. Class isnt an explicit issue, although Jill (Caitlin Stasey) is belittled for her accent by her snooty Manhattan bosses, but you underscore how things were different. 

 

A: I think its tougher for working class kids today to pursue their dreams. I was able to go to Hunter College at $600 a semester and take film classes. The barrier to entry to some of those fields is tougher now. Tammy (Gigi Zumbado) is going to Columbia Business School and is paying for it with her waitressing job, but today I dont think that would be enough to make it realistic. 

 

Q: You were set to make the series and then the pandemic happened, and COVID protocols like constant testing and deep cleaning cost $2 million, a big chunk of your budget. Did your background as an indie filmmaker help prepare you for this? 

 

A: Ive made so many no-budget and low-budget movies  you have to be able to think on your feet, to rewrite a scene on a moments notice, tear up your plans for the day when you lose an actor or when the cops show up and say, Hey you dont have a permit. 

 

If I do have a strength as a filmmaker, its my ability to pivot. They said with the $2 million they didnt think we could do the series. I said, I can re-imagine this show. We were originally doing eight episodes, and half the show took place in Manhattan  wed see characters coming out of an interview or meeting in a bar there. 

 

I said Id cut it to six episodes and rewrite everything to take place on the block where they grew up. I moved as many interior scenes as possible to exterior locations for safety, which is why theyre always in the park or hanging in the backyard. 

 

Q: Early in your career you cast rising stars like Connie Britton, Leslie Mann, Cameron Diaz and Amanda Peet. Was it fun looking for new faces again? 

 

A: Definitely. We didnt need name recognition, so I said Lets find the best actors, but look for the kids who keep losing out to the more well-known actors. Like a ballplayer in Triple A whos ready and just needs someone to take a chance on him. 

 

Sam Vartholomeos is from Astoria and still lives in Queens. When he came in, he said in auditions it always came down to him and another guy and hed lose out. But I knew he was the real deal. 

 

He went to LaGuardia High School and hed had a teacher saying, Youve got to get rid of that Queens accent. He was really concerned and was working on it until another teacher said, Dont worry so much  plenty of actors work with an accent. One day, hopefully, youll get to play Ed Burns son. 

 

At his first wardrobe fitting he asks who's playing his parents. When he was told Im playing his dad, he says, Get de [expletive] outta here. Are you kiddin me?

Aynhoe Park was furnished with a vast collection of iconic objects and curiosities from the Perkins travels across the globe and featured artworks, books, sculpture, furniture, taxidermy, modern design and curiosities, which were evocative of the modern Grand Tour, hence the auction title. 

 

Some of the most iconic pieces in the sale included those conceived by James Perkins himself, for his studio. These included the Flying Giraffe, which went through the roof at £125,000, as well as the Aynhoe Moon picture, which shone with a £17,500 price. These and other works have cemented James Perkins as a designer and artist in his own right. 

 

Speaking after the sale, James Perkins said: Sophie and I are humbled by the interest generated by the sale. It really was the celebration that we had wished for and we hope that everyone will enjoy their bit of Aynhoe. Many thanks to Dreweatts and our team at Aynhoe for a great job in making it happen. 

 

The sale totalled £4.1 million against a pre-sale low estimate of £1.3 million, with buyers taking the opportunity to own a true piece of English history, which culminated in competitive bidding, sometimes up until the last second, as the hammer was about to go down! 

 

Commenting on the sale, Will Richards, Deputy Chairman of Dreweatts, said: We are delighted with the result of this spectacular sale, which broke boundaries in so many ways. Dreweatts always approaches sales of private collections and house sales as creatively as possible and the current pandemic was no exception. 

 

Having faced the first lockdown, we set to work to find a way that would offer clients the Aynhoe Park experience, without having to break lockdown rules to tour the house. We created a 360 degree virtual tour of the property with items for sale popping up as they were laid out in each room, with lot descriptions and estimates. This gave anyone interested in buying from the sale, a sense of having viewed the item in situ. We worked closely with the Perkins to ensure the contents of Aynhoe were presented and represented in the way that they wanted them to be and in a way that celebrated the collection and its surroundings. 

 

 

 

 

We very much enjoyed the diversity of the sale, which allowed us to reach and celebrate this wonderful collection with existing and new clients around the world.

534,535,https://www.pix11.com/news/coronavirus/supplies-thin-but-new-york-not-out-of-vaccine,"ALBANY, N.Y. — Despite Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s warning that New York was about to exhaust its coronavirus vaccine supply, the state isn't running on empty.

Cuomo said the state had only around 28,000 doses left for people getting their first shot.

But that referred to how much vaccine was available out of the stockpile of first doses the state had at the week’s start.

Cuomo wasn’t including nearly a quarter-million doses from new shipments or hundreds of thousands of doses being distributed to nursing homes through a federal program.

And he also wasn’t including a big stockpile reserved for people getting the second of two shots.","Supplies thin, but New York not out of vaccine",www.pix11.com
535,536,https://artdaily.com/news/132324/Larry-King--breezy-interviewer-of-the-famous-and-infamous--dies-at-87,"Larry King, who shot the breeze with presidents and psychics, movie stars and malefactors  anyone with a story to tell or a pitch to make  in a half-century on radio and television, including 25 years as the host of CNNs globally popular Larry King Live, died Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 87. 

 

Ora Media, which King co-founded in 2012, confirmed the death in a statement posted on Kings own Twitter account and said he had died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 

 

The statement did not specify a cause of death, but King had recently been treated for COVID-19. In 2019, he was hospitalized for chest pains and said he had also suffered a stroke. 

 

A son of European immigrants who grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and never went to college, King began as a local radio interviewer and sportscaster in Florida in the 1950s and 60s, rose to prominence with an all-night coast-to-coast radio call-in show starting in 1978, and from 1985 to 2010 anchored CNNs highest-rated, longest-running program, reaching millions across America and around the world. 

 

With the folksy personality of a Bensonhurst schmoozer, King interviewed an estimated 50,000 people of every imaginable persuasion and claim to fame  every president since Richard Nixon, world leaders, royalty, religious and business figures, crime and disaster victims, pundits, swindlers, experts on UFOs and paranormal phenomena, and untold hosts of idiosyncratic and insomniac telephone callers. 

 

Forever Star-Struck 

King might have made a fascinating guest on his own show: the delivery boy who became one of Americas most famous TV and radio personalities, a newspaper columnist, the author of numerous books and a performer in dozens of movies and television shows, mostly as himself. 

 

His personal life was the stuff of supermarket tabloids: married eight times to seven women; a chronic gambler who declared bankruptcy twice; arrested on a fraud charge that derailed his career for years; and a bundle of contradictions who never quite got over his own success but gushed, star-struck, over other celebrities, exclaiming, Great! Terrific! and Gee whiz! 

 

He made no claim to being a journalist, although his show sometimes made news, as when Ross Perot announced his presidential candidacy there in 1992. And he was not confrontational; he rarely asked anyone, let alone a politician or policymaker, a tough or technical question, preferring gentle prods to get guests to say interesting things about themselves. 

 

To Nixon: When you drive by the Watergate, do you feel weird? 

 

To former President Ronald Reagan: Is it, for you, frustrating to not remember something? 

 

To Donald Trump, when he was still best known as a real estate mogul: Does it have to be buildings? 

 

He bragged that he almost never prepared for an interview. If his guest was an author promoting a book, he did not read it but asked simply, Whats it about? or Why did you write this? Nor did he pose as an intellectual. He salted his talk with aint, and the sounded like da. To a public skeptical of experts, he seemed refreshingly average: just a curious guy asking questions impulsively. 

 

There are many broadcasters wholl recite three minutes of facts before they ask a question, he said in a memoir, My Remarkable Journey (2009, with Cal Fussman). As if to say: Let me show you how much I know. I think the guest should be the expert. 

 

Politicians, crackpot inventors, conspiracy theorists and spiritual mediums loved his show, which let them reach huge audiences without facing challenging questions. King called it infotainment, and for millions across America and some 130 countries around the world, it was a delightful, if sometimes bizarre, hybrid of information and entertainment, delivered in prime time for an hour each weeknight. 

 

King lived in Beverly Hills, California, and his show was broadcast mainly from CNNs Los Angeles studios but sometimes from New York or Washington, where he had been a radio interviewer for Mutual. As in his radio days, he took questions and comments from callers, who often had to be cut off for verbosity or for using obscenities. 

 

A Friendly Interrogator 

King had what one writer called a face made for radio. It was gaunt and bony, with a prominent nose, receding hair, thin lips and beady eyes behind oversize black-rimmed glasses. He was raptor thin, a strict dieter since a 1987 heart attack and quintuple bypass surgery. In his trademark shirt sleeves and suspenders, he slouched in a chair on his elbows and peered over a desk at his guests. His voice, a raspy rumble, delivered bursts of irreverence and humor, but his questions were usually brief and friendly. 

 

The topics were anything: politics, crime, religion, sports, business, news events like O.J. Simpsons long-running 1995 murder trial, with its endless players and analysts. But he rarely plumbed subjects deeply, and he was accused by critics of pandering to the sensational, like the deaths of Anna Nicole Smith and Michael Jackson, by reminiscing with their confidants. 

 

Mainstream journalists scoffed at his lean treatments and nice-guy techniques. But his audiences and sponsors were faithful. 

 

After decades of success, however, Larry King Live began losing its high ratings and A-list bookings as many viewers turned to partisan voices like MSNBCs liberal Rachel Maddow and Foxs conservative Sean Hannity. By 2010, Kings audience had fallen to a fraction of what it had been in his peak years. He stepped down in December, and CNN replaced him with Piers Morgan Tonight. 

 

 

 

How a historian got close, maybe too close, to a Nazi thief 

 

 

 

In 2012, King migrated to the internet with a show streamed by Ora.tv on Ora TV, Hulu and RT (a U.S. version of Russia Today). The show was called Larry King Now. But it was hardly the same. 

 

Drawn to the Radio 

Larry King was born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger in Brooklyn on Nov. 19, 1933, the second son of Edward and Jennie Gitlitz Zeiger, immigrants from Austria and Belarus. Their first son, Irwin, had died earlier. A younger brother, Martin, became a lawyer. 

 

Larry Kings father ran a bar and grill but worked at a defense plant after World War II began. He died of a heart attack in 1943, and the family went on welfare until Kings mother found work as a seamstress in Manhattans garment district. 

 

Devastated by his fathers death, King, a good student who had skipped the third grade, neglected studies and listened to the radio  Brooklyn Dodgers games, The Lone Ranger, The Shadow and Arthur Godfrey, whom he worshipped. He graduated from Lafayette High School in 1951 with barely passing grades. 

 

His 1952 marriage to Frada Miller was quickly annulled. Later, he was briefly married to Annette Kaye; they had a son, Larry Jr., whom King did not know about until 33 years later. In 1961, he married Alene Akins, who had a son by a previous marriage, Andy, whom King adopted; they were divorced in 1963. 

 

He and his fourth wife, Mickey Sutphin, were divorced in 1966 after having a daughter, Kelly, who was adopted by her subsequent husband. In 1967, he again married Akins; they had a daughter, Chaia, and were divorced in 1972. In 1976, he married Sharon Lepore; they were divorced. 

 

His 1989 marriage to Julia Alexander also ended in divorce. In 1997, he married Shawn Southwick; they had two sons, Chance and Cannon. 

 

Kings children with Akins, Andy and Chaia, both died in 2020. In addition to his wife and their two sons, he is survived by another son, Larry Jr.; a stepson, Daniel Southwick; and a number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 

 

After high school he wanted to work in radio but was uncertain how to start. For four years, he was a deliverer and messenger. Then a CBS staffer advised him to try Florida, a growing market where radio openings existed. 

 

At 23, he went to Miami and was hired by a small station, WAHR, to sweep floors and run errands. When a disc jockey suddenly quit, he was asked to take over the 9 a.m.-to-noon broadcast. 

 

Minutes before airtime on May 1, 1957, at the station managers suggestion, the name Lawrence Zeiger was abandoned, and Larry King (the surname taken from a liquor distributors advertisement) sat before a live microphone for the first time. 

 

I was petrified, he told People magazine in 1980. The theme music was supposed to fade, and I was supposed to do a voice-over. But every time the music faded, Id turn it back up again. Finally, the station manager stuck his head into the studio and said, Remember, this is a communicating business. I let the music go down and told the audience what had just happened. Those were my first words on the radio. 

 

He also did two afternoon newscasts. He was good at it, and other stations noticed. In 1958, he joined WKAT and began a morning show at Pumperniks, a Miami Beach restaurant, interviewing patrons to boost the breakfast trade. His guests included Don Rickles, Lenny Bruce, Jimmy Hoffa and Bobby Darin. Celebrities soon made a point of stopping in. Business boomed. 

 

I found I had an ability to draw people out in an interview, King recalled in a 1982 memoir, Larry King by Larry King. Never knowing who would be interviewed or what would be said, he ad-libbed, and that became his shtick. 

 

In the early 1960s he did late-night radio interviews on WIOD, was a color commentator for Miami Dolphins football games, and dabbled in television with a talk show on WLBW and a weekend show on WTVJ. He later wrote columns for The Miami Herald and The Miami News. Ella Fitzgerald and Ed Sullivan befriended him. Jackie Gleason became his mentor and got him an interview with Frank Sinatra. 

 

Problems, Then a Comeback 

But as his career flourished, his problems multiplied. He spent lavishly on cars and clothes, lost heavily on horse races and fell behind in his taxes. Despite a large income, he plunged into debt. He declared bankruptcy in 1960. In 1971, he was charged with defrauding a former business partner of $5,000 and lost his broadcasting and newspaper jobs. The charges were dropped in 1972. But with his reputation damaged, he could not find work. 

 

Over the next few years, he tried to rebuild his career with freelance writing and radio jobs on the West Coast and public relations work at a Louisiana racetrack. In the mid-70s, after the fraud case had blown over, he was rehired by WIOD and as a Dolphins commentator and Miami News columnist. With $352,000 in debts, he declared bankruptcy for a second time in 1978. 

 

That year was also a new beginning for King. He was hired by Mutual to succeed the recently deceased Long John Nebel as host of a weeknight coast-to-coast radio talkathon for night owls and early risers. The Larry King Show, featuring interviews and listener calls, drew a devoted national following, won a Peabody Award in 1982, eventually expanded to 500 affiliates and ran until 1994. 

 

Ted Turner put him on CNN in 1985, and his first guest was Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York. At the peak of his success, King was a media whirlwind. He produced (with various writers) several memoirs, two books on heart disease and volumes on many other subjects; appeared in dozens of movies and television shows; wrote columns for USA Today for two decades; and was showered with awards, honorary degrees and the adulation of fans. 

 

The centerpiece of his career, Larry King Live, became televisions highest-rated talk show and CNNs biggest success story. It won a Peabody in 1992, and for its last show, on Dec. 16, 2010, he assembled a galaxy of stars, including President Barack Obama on a recording, to pay tribute to the King.

In 1958, he joined WKAT and began a morning show at Pumperniks, a Miami Beach restaurant, interviewing patrons to boost the breakfast trade. His guests included Don Rickles, Lenny Bruce, Jimmy Hoffa and Bobby Darin. Celebrities soon made a point of stopping in. Business boomed.I found I had an ability to draw people out in an interview, King recalled in a 1982 memoir, Larry King by Larry King. Never knowing who would be interviewed or what would be said, he ad-libbed, and that became his shtick.In the early 1960s he did late-night radio interviews on WIOD, was a color commentator for Miami Dolphins football games, and dabbled in television with a talk show on WLBW and a weekend show on WTVJ. He later wrote columns for The Miami Herald and The Miami News. Ella Fitzgerald and Ed Sullivan befriended him. Jackie Gleason became his mentor and got him an interview with Frank Sinatra.But as his career flourished, his problems multiplied. He spent lavishly on cars and clothes, lost heavily on horse races and fell behind in his taxes. Despite a large income, he plunged into debt. He declared bankruptcy in 1960. In 1971, he was charged with defrauding a former business partner of $5,000 and lost his broadcasting and newspaper jobs. The charges were dropped in 1972. But with his reputation damaged, he could not find work.Over the next few years, he tried to rebuild his career with freelance writing and radio jobs on the West Coast and public relations work at a Louisiana racetrack. In the mid-70s, after the fraud case had blown over, he was rehired by WIOD and as a Dolphins commentator and Miami News columnist. With $352,000 in debts, he declared bankruptcy for a second time in 1978.That year was also a new beginning for King. He was hired by Mutual to succeed the recently deceased Long John Nebel as host of a weeknight coast-to-coast radio talkathon for night owls and early risers. The Larry King Show, featuring interviews and listener calls, drew a devoted national following, won a Peabody Award in 1982, eventually expanded to 500 affiliates and ran until 1994.Ted Turner put him on CNN in 1985, and his first guest was Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York. At the peak of his success, King was a media whirlwind.

Hernandez, a 29 year old infielder who has played every position except catcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers since they acquired him after the 2014 season from the Miami Marlins in the deal that brought Andrew Heaney and Austin Barnes to the Dodgers as well, with Dan Haren, Dee Gordon and Miguel Rojas going to Miami, was reported to have agreed to terms with the Red Sox last night. The Red Sox, who have been hunting for a second baseman this offseason, also were reported to be in on Jurickson Profar before he signed with San Diego. With Profar off the table, the Red Sox have apparently scooped up Hernandez, who will likely be their regular second baseman.

Hernandez got the bulk of his playing time the last couple of years with the Dodgers at second base, and has slashed .240/.313/.425 for his career. He was originally a Houston Astros, and was sent to the Marlins in the deal that also saw Jarred Cosart go to Miami, with Jake Marisnick and Colin Moran coming to Houston. Hernandez is reportedly getting $14 million over two years from Boston.

This afternoon, meanwhile, national guys are reporting that the Red Sox and pitcher Garrett Richards have agreed to terms on a one year deal for $10 million. Richards, who turns 33 in May, is a righthander originally with the Los Angeles Angels whose has long had great stuff, but struggled to stay healthy. Richards has qualified for the ERA title just twice, in 2014 and 2015 — since the start of the 2016 season Richards has logged just 198 innings over 45 appearances.

Richards signed a two year contract with the San Diego Padres after a 2018 season that was cut short due to Tommy John surgery, though he did make it back on the mound for three outings in 2019. In 2020, he put up a 4.03 ERA and 4.28 FIP in 10 starts and 4 relief appearances totaling 51.1 IP. He’ll now presumably be part of the Red Sox rotation in 2021.","BoSox land Hernandez, Richards, per reports",www.lonestarball.com

As a candidate, Biden promised “there will not be another foot” of border wall built during his administration. Hours after his inauguration on Wednesday, Biden directed federal officials to “pause work on each construction project on the southern border wall” as soon as possible and no later than seven days after his proclamation. The Army Corps of Engineers directed contractors “not to install any additional physical barriers” along the border, according to a statement from the Corps on Thursday. Contractors were prohibited from doing any work except for what is “necessary to safely prepare each site for a suspension of work.” While critics of the wall applauded Biden’s order and reported work stoppages from various parts of Arizona’s border with Mexico, their cheers came after the Trump administration built nearly all the 245 miles of wall planned for Arizona’s border with Mexico. And construction could start again after the Biden administration’s 60-day review of wall projects. The wall consists of 30-foot-tall steel bollards filled with concrete. The bollards are 6 inches wide and separated from each other by 4 inches of space, which allows Border Patrol agents to see activity on the Mexico side of the border. The wall is topped with anti-climbing plates, and the foundation extends 6 to 10 feet underground to thwart tunneling.

In his order Wednesday, Biden said “building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution. It is a waste of money that diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security.” Former President Donald Trump told crowds at rallies that the wall was “like magic.” Border Patrol officials have said the wall will help slow down attempts to cross the border illegally and allow agents to cover more ground during their shifts. Agents have told the Star the roads that are part of the wall projects will help them quickly respond to incidents at the border. “It stopped most older people and most younger kids. When they walk up and they see a 30-foot-high wall, it stops them,” Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott told the Star last fall. “It doesn’t always stop the 22-year-old. It doesn’t always stop the super-agile. But you know what? Now it’s one (person),” instead of large groups crossing together. Last week, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, a Democrat whose district includes part of the Arizona-Mexico border, said the wall “has always been a vanity project and campaign chant rather than an effective security infrastructure project.” Since 2019, the Corps awarded $4.8 billion worth of contracts, paid for with Defense Department funds, to build 222 miles of wall in Arizona. Another 23 miles of wall projects in Arizona were funded by other means, including Congressional appropriations.

As of Jan. 15, contractors installed 226 miles of bollards on the Arizona border, according to Customs and Border Protection, leaving less than 20 miles still under construction. The Corps’ list of wall projects showed the installation of bollards was not complete as of early last week in areas near Sasabe, Nogales, Naco, the southeastern corner of Cochise County and a small area near Yuma. Beyond the steel bollards, the installation of sensors, lights, cameras and roads, which make up what federal officials often call the “border wall system,” is not expected to be complete for any project in Arizona until the summer at the earliest, according to the Corps. After Biden issued his proclamation, local residents and environmental advocates rushed to the border to ensure contractors were complying. Construction activity was shut down on Thursday, said Myles Traphagen, borderlands project coordinator for the Wildlands Network, who headed to a 4-mile wall project east of Nogales. No bollards had been installed yet in that project, he said. John Kurc, a photographer who has spent months documenting the wall project in Guadalupe Canyon in the southeastern corner of Cochise County, particularly the blasting of rock at construction sites, said the last blast he saw was on Wednesday morning.

Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner at the Tucson-based Center for Biological Diversity and longtime critic of the wall, posted a video on Friday of a wall project across the San Pedro River in Cochise County showing contractors had vacated the area. Jordahl later posted a video showing activity at a wall construction site on the Coronado Memorial, a mountainous area a few miles west of the San Pedro River. Kurc said he saw “earthmovers all over the west side” of the memorial on Friday. On Saturday morning, Melissa Owen, who lives near Sasabe, flew in a helicopter over nearby wall construction sites. As of 8:40 a.m. on Saturday, “they were actively carving through the mountains,” Owen said. She could not see any bollards being installed, but other construction work appeared to be continuing “as usual” with trucks, bulldozers, excavators and water trucks operating both to the east and west of Sasabe, she said. The Star reached out to the Corps to clarify whether the work was normal wrap-up work at a construction site, which the Biden proclamation appeared to allow, or some sort of attempt to defy Biden’s order. Corps spokesman Jay Field reiterated a portion of the Corps’ statement from Thursday saying the only work that would be done over the next few days would be to prepare sites for the suspension of work. “We are not installing any additional physical barriers,” Field said.

The owner of the contracting company building the wall near Sasabe did not respond to an inquiry from the Star on Saturday morning. In addition to pausing construction, Biden’s order also ended the national emergency Trump declared in February 2019, which was used to divert roughly $10 billion from the Defense Department to wall construction. Another $5 billion came from congressional appropriations, according to CBP. During the pause, Biden administration officials will conduct a “careful review of all resources appropriated or redirected to construct a southern border wall.” He directed officials to assess the “legality of the funding and contracting methods used to construct the wall.” The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments next month about the legality of diverting Defense Department funds after Congress denied the bulk of the Trump administration’s request for wall funding. Officials can make exceptions to the pause in construction “to avert immediate physical dangers” or to ensure that funds appropriated by Congress “fulfill their intended purpose,” according to Biden’s proclamation. Officials will develop a plan for the “redirection” of wall funding within 60 days. They must then “take all appropriate steps to resume, modify or terminate projects and to otherwise implement the plan.”",Border wall nearly finished in Arizona as Biden pushes pause,tucson.com

The owner, Maurice Tolliver, said his goal is to bring more of a sneaker culture to the area.

“We don't have anything like this in the area, you got to travel to Atlanta or Charlotte, you know, maybe Columbia to get something like what we offer,” Tolliver said.

There was a line of customers outside, waiting for the store to open.

“There’s not a lot of Black-owned stores that I would say in the South Carolina area, so I mean I think this would be good to bring out more of the community to him to support, especially to expand him a little bit further as well, so it’s good on both sides,” Raven Johnson, a customer, said.

Johnson said the store “most definitely has exclusive everything” when it comes to the shoes sold in the store.

Now that the store is open, people are welcome to bring in their shoes to trade and sell. There is no limit of how many shoes you can bring in, and the customer will be told an estimate of how much they can receive for their shoes.

“You can buy a shoe, or if you got some old stuff in the closet, you can bring that in and you can trade it towards another pair or you can sell it to me so you know, you just don't get that on the big chain stores,” Tolliver said.

Tolliver said most of the shoes sold in his store are not sold at the major chain stores in their area, and if it was sold there it is a shoe that sold out quickly.

“We pretty much take retro Jordan’s, and some of the more exclusive and hard to find shoes, because it's hard for us to compete with somebody like a Foot Locker so you know we just kind of get the stuff that's exclusive that they don't have,” Tolliver said.

Tolliver has been in the shoe business for 10 years now, selling shoes at conventions and on eBay. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the conventions were no longer an option, but he continues to sell online.

The pandemic has also had an effect on the store’s opening date.

“I was originally supposed to open on Black Friday, if that tells you anything, so it's just been one obstacle after another,” Tolliver said.

Although Tolliver faced a couple of challenges opening his new store, he is excited for what is to come.

“I'm definitely looking to expand, I would like to have another store by the end of the year, kind of close in the area, and then from there, I'm looking to branch out and the sky is the limit,” Tolliver said.

The Retro Store is located at 141 Edgewood Drive, North Augusta, SC 29841 and is open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.","New shoe store opens in North Augusta, offering unique consumer experience to area",www.postandcourier.com

“Don’t overload your electric circuits,"" said Pless. ""If you’ve got any cords or appliances like lamps that look old or frayed or bent, just toss it out. It’s not worth the hassle.”

“There’s some reason to believe in a lot of cases when a fire happens inside a dwelling like that, if you can remember this, knowing people are in a panic, shut the door behind you,"" said Pless. ""Because fires feed on the oxygen.”

However, he said the fire could've been much worse and he's glad a majority of the residents made it out safely and are being cared for by the community.

“We’re just fortunate here in Catoosa County to have so many wonderful people and organizations that help in time of need,"" said Pless. ""It’s good to see those people are being taken care of.”

Soot, ashes, and debris were left behind as the Catoosa County Fire Department and other agencies such as East Ridge Fire Department tried to tame the flames and managed to contain the fire hours later.

Catoosa County Assistant Fire Chief Brad Buchanan said three people were rescued from the jaws of this fire. When asked if all three were women he said, “I think so. I know one was a child and two adults.”

541,542,https://wpst.com/monday-tuesday-looks-wintry-and-messy-but-dont-buy-the-major-storm-hype/,"For the latest winter storm forecast information, please refer to my newest weather blog post.

I decided not to put together a full afternoon forecast update. But I did post the following to social media after perusing the afternoon model runs. No big changes in the big picture forecast.

Words matter. Especially in science. Especially in broadcasting.

If you're a regular reader of my weather content, you know that I always try to present an honest and realistic representation of the forecast. I'm very careful and deliberate about not only my forecasting technique, but also the words I use to communicate the weather.

Unquestionably, I would rather be right than first. I would much rather induce calm over panic. And I strive to offer a clear and open expert assessment of a weather situation, rather than one muddled with confusing second-hand analysis. I'd rather admit I don't know than make stuff up.

This week, you've probably seen headlines in your social media feeds warning of a ""major"" snow storm, a ""huge"" blast of winter, and even a ""blizzard"" for New Jersey. As I have discussed, there is indeed a storm system aiming for New Jersey in the Monday night to Tuesday time frame. And yes, it has the potential to bring wintry and messy conditions to the entire state. However, confidence continues to increase that snow accumulations and overall impacts will be limited.

We're now within 72 hours of the first flakes, and the forecast is taking shape. For the rest of this post, I want to outline what we know and what we don't about this winter storm. I'll offer some generalized details regarding timing and totals. We'll piece together more details (including a snowfall map, if justified) on Sunday.

You can thank a big dome of high pressure over Canada for keeping all that storm development south of New Jersey. The other piece of the puzzle missing here is a ""wavy"" atmosphere. (In other words, meridional flow and a deep negatively-tilted trough.) There's just no ""highway in the sky"" for that secondary storm to turn and parallel the Atlantic seaboard. (Like a classic nor'easter.)

The southern storm track presents a classic meteorological conundrum. Temperatures will be cold enough for ""all snow"" in North Jersey. But the most moisture and heaviest precipitation will fall in warmer South Jersey. Somewhere in the middle, there could be a sweet spot of messy and wintry weather. Especially if heavier mesoscale snow bands develop. But where? And how much? Welcome to my life.

Why Should You Care?

There are two primary reasons this storm deserves our close attention:

1.) Across the board, forecast models have been very consistent in bringing at least some snow/ice accumulation to New Jersey.

2.) Massive snow accumulation is not required for messy travel conditions here in the most densely populated state in the nation. (See #Brinegate, November 2018.)

And here are four reasons why I believe the ""major storm"" prophecies will bust:

1.) As I mentioned, the center of the storm is expected to stay to our south, keeping the heaviest precipitation bands away too.

2.) A wall of dry air (especially north). Cold air is, by definitely, dry air. And it may become very difficult to squeeze out substantial snowflakes.

3.) Lots of mixing (especially south and coast). Any periods of sleet and/or rain would drastically cut into potential accumulations.

4.) There are hints the storm will fizzle on Tuesday. Initial predictions had bands of precipitation on top of us all day Tuesday. But now there are signs it will lose a lot of its ""oomph"" and progressively weaken.

--First flakes/drops look to push into southwestern New Jersey around the early evening hours on Monday (6 p.m.) Most likely a wintry mix initially. That will slowly spread north and east, potentially enveloping the entire state in some sort of precipitation (liquid, frozen or both) by early Tuesday morning (2 a.m.)

--The brunt of the storm (if you can call it that) with the heaviest snow/mix/rain and most accumulation looks to be Tuesday morning (2 a.m. to 10 a.m.)

--The end of the storm gets tricky. There's a chance that we'll taper to showers through Tuesday afternoon and night. But I'd put equal odds at another burst of (wintry) precipitation coming through at some point.

--The most-likely scenario puts about 1 to 3 inches of total snow accumulation across most of New Jersey. Less to the south and along the coast, where rain will be more prevalent. (Possibly even zero snowfall, in fact.) And the potential for more is there, if the storm overperforms and/or we get convective snow bands.

--The maximum snow scenario would be 6 or 8 inches, most likely in the northern half of the state. I don't think the current model guidance supports such big totals. But the possibility is certainly something we have to keep in mind.

--The minimum snow scenario would be no more than an inch of accumulation, due to the above-freezing temperatures and dry air concerns I shared above. Zero snowfall is absolutely on the table for any corner of the state.

--The potential for icing due to sleet and freezing rain is also something to watch, especially across the southern half of the state.

--Tuesday morning's commute will be the potentially tricky one. Messy road conditions could necessitate school delays or even closings (for those districts attending in-person).

--In NWS speak, this looks like an ""advisory"" level storm, if that. If the current forecast holds, I doubt warnings will be issued in NJ.

--Severe wind, coastal flooding, and dangerous cold are not expected at this time. Good.

But That's Not All!

I cautioned that our atmosphere was starting to fire up, with more active weather conditions ahead. Proof positive, there is another storm system we're monitoring around the Thursday time frame.

Previously, it looked like this one would completely miss us to the south, as we remain entrenched on the cold side of the jet stream. However, recent guidance has crept those snow bands closer and closer to New Jersey.

This one potentially looks stronger and more moisture-rich than the Monday-Tuesday storm. I'll even say it has ""major winter storm"" potential (>6 inches), if it gets close enough.

We're still 5-6 days away, so it remains in the ""worth watching"" category for now. We'll continue to update you on this late week storm too. But I doubt we'll have a clear forecast until the early week storm departs. (Forecast models perform best when handling one storm at a time.)

Next weather blog update is expected sometime Sunday morning. Until then, enjoy your weekend and stay warm!

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg was distracted before he drove onto a highway shoulder where he struck and killed a pedestrian in September, state Secretary of Public Safety Craig Price said Monday.

Price said 55-year-old Joseph Boever was walking on the side of the road and displaying some type of light on the night of Sept. 12 when Ravnsborg’s 2011 Ford Taurus hit him. Price did not describe what led Ravnsborg to become distracted and he did not respond to questions about what the distraction was.

Ravnsborg called 911 that night and told a dispatcher that he hit “something” and that “it was in the middle of the road.” When the dispatcher asked if it could have been a deer, Ravnsborg initially said, “I have no idea” before adding, “It could be.”

Boever’s relatives believe he was walking toward his truck that had crashed earlier that evening.

Ravnsborg initially told a county sheriff dispatched to the crash site on U.S. Highway 14 near Highmore in central South Dakota that he thought he struck a deer. He said he returned to the scene the next morning and discovered he had struck a man.

Ravnsborg spokesman Mike Deaver did not immediately return a phone message Monday left by The Associated Press.

Whether Ravnsborg can be charged for distracted driving depends on what caused him to leave the roadway, Price said. A new state law that went into effect July 1 made texting and driving a primary offense that carries a $122.50 fine.

Hyde County State’s Attorney Emily Sovell, who is handling the case, did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment.

Boever’s cousin Nick Nemec said he was not surprised to hear that Ravnsborg was distracted and drove onto the shoulder of the road. Nemec said he visited the crash site numerous times and “you don’t have to be a rocket scientist” to figure out what happened.

“I think the attorney general should be charged at the very least with distracted driving,” Nemec said. “If he was distracted, then you’re getting into the territory of involuntary manslaughter. I think that would be an appropriate charge.”

Ravnsborg, a Republican, is serving his first term after winning election in 2018.

While the investigation is largely completed, authorities said, they are still waiting on several reports, including a coroner’s summary. The speed limit at the site of the crash is 65 mph (105 kph), but it is unclear how fast Ravnsborg was driving. Price would not say whether Boever was walking with or against traffic.

Price would not describe what type of light Boever was carrying, but Nemac said it was not his cellphone.

“My brother Victor went into Joe’s house the next day and Joe’s cellphone was sitting on the table in Joe’s house,” Nemec said. “So that light had to be some other form of light.”

The attorney general was driving home to Pierre from a Republican fundraiser some 110 miles (180 kilometers) away in Redfield. Ravnsborg had said he had nothing to drink.

A toxicology report taken roughly 15 hours after the crash showed no alcohol in Ravnsborg’s system, although at least one expert said that would have been enough time for alcohol to leave the body.

A crash reconstruction expert from Wyoming and the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation assisted the South Dakota Highway Patrol in the investigation.

Such accidents would ordinarily be investigated by the South Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which answers to the attorney general’s office. The other agencies took on the investigation to avoid a conflict of interest.

A preliminary autopsy report showed Boever died from extensive traumatic injuries from the crash.

543,544,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/531563/Biden-admin-to-review-Trump%E2%80%99s-Taliban-deal,"WASHINGTON: The Biden administration said it will review a landmark US deal with the Taliban, focusing on whether the insurgent group has reduced attacks in Afghanistan, in keeping with its side of the agreement, reports AFP.

Washington struck a deal with the Taliban in Qatar last year, to begin withdrawing its troops in return for security guarantees from the militants and a commitment to kickstart peace talks with the Afghan government.

President Joe Biden’s newly appointed national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, spoke with his Afghan counterpart Hamdullah Mohib and “made clear the United States’ intention to review” the deal, said National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne late Friday.

Specifically, Washington wants to check that the Taliban is “living up to its commitments to cut ties with terrorist groups, to reduce violence in Afghanistan, and to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan government and other stakeholders,” her statement continued.

It added that Sullivan “underscored that the US will support the peace process with a robust and regional diplomatic effort, which will aim to help the two sides achieve a durable and just political settlement and permanent ceasefire.”

Sullivan also discussed the United States’ support for protecting recent progress made on women and minority groups’ rights as part of the peace process. When contacted, the Taliban said they remained “committed to the agreement and honour our commitments”. “We expect the other side to remain committed to the agreement too,” Mohammad Naeem, the group’s spokesman in Qatar, told AFP.

Washington’s move was met with a sigh of relief from officials in Kabul after months of speculation over how the new administration would potentially recalibrate the Afghan policy.

Another top Afghan government official lambasted the Taliban’s failure to live up to the February 2020 deal, saying the agreement had failed to achieve its stated goals.

“The agreement so far, did not deliver a desired goal of ending Taliban’s violence and bringing a ceasefire desired by the Afghans,” Sediq Sediqqi, Deputy Interior Minister and former spokesman to President Ashraf Ghani said on Twitter.

“The Taliban did not live up to its commitments.”

Deadly attacks and high-profile assassinations have increased in recent months, particularly in Kabul where several journalists, activists, judges and politicians have been murdered in brazen daylight attacks.

The Taliban have denied responsibility for these killings, but Afghan and US officials have blamed the group for the murders.

On Tuesday, Biden’s nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told his Senate confirmation hearing that “we want to end this so-called forever war.”",Biden admin to review Trump’s Taliban deal | daily sun,www.daily-sun.com

“We started reinventing ourselves. We learned many things and decided to change many things,” he says.

“More than anything, the idea of giving people a lot more value for their money is the main thing that is coming out of this pandemic. It’s clear that there’s going to be less travelers, it’s clear that there’s going to be less agents,” Tsabari says.

“I didn’t really think I could learn the unicycle,” she says.“It was literally something to do. It was exercise, there was no social involvement, not near people, so it kind of fit in this crazy year. It took a lot of work and a lot of practice and time,” she adds.

“It was really a much bigger lesson than the unicycle. It was something very deep for me. It was a big, big leap for me to be able to literally let go — let go of the wall, let go of my fear of falling and my fear of failing.”

As the director of geriatrics at Herzog Medical Center in Jerusalem, Prof. Efraim Jaul has a pretty good idea of how Covid-19 has deeply affected the lives of the elderly.

“There’s no doubt that this is a traumatic, unsettling event, there’s an uncertainty that’s a very critical component,” Jaul says. “I have no doubt that it’s creating difficult reactions.”

And yet, Jaul is intent on finding positive aspects to this pandemic and accordingly making changes to our daily lives. These, he says, can include rediscovering hobbies such as cooking and reading, taking a break from endlessly helping out children and grandchildren and utilizing new technologies – he himself discovered podcasts this year.

Jaul also believes that elderly people are uniquely positioned to gain a healthy perspective on the current crisis.

“Why is this panic over coronavirus coming from an elderly person? After all, you remember world wars, you remember the Holocaust suffered by the Jewish people, you remember adversity,” he says. “The ups and downs of life are a part of us, especially in old age,” he says.

“Life isn’t easy; it’s complicated, also without the coronavirus. Covid has added another difficulty. It’s challenging you, so make the change and challenge yourself even in your old age.”

Yehudit Isaacs is the supervising nurse of the emergency department at Laniado Hospital in Netanya, which serves about half a million people in central Israel. She, her husband and four of her children were among the earliest to have contracted Covid in the country.

“I think that beyond being an illness that damages lungs and creates problems there, corona is first of all a disease of loneliness,” she says.

This loneliness, she says, is multifaceted and affects wide-ranging populations, whether elderly people, people stuck in quarantine at home, patients in corona wards or children unable to go to school.

“The thing that I learned during this time is the importance of touch, the support up close for which there’s no substitute. The human touch can’t be replaced with technological measures, advanced as they may be,” she says.

“This conclusion about how important touch is, it brought us back to our families and to the right proportions about what’s important in life,” she adds.

To her, even lockdown had a positive message.

“There’s something very moral and incredible about a whole population taking fateful decisions to protect the elderly,” she says.

“We’ve proved in a big way that we care about and respect elderly people and that we’re protecting them. To me, that’s very, very important education.”

“Despite corona and it being a big mess from every aspect, we tried to carry on with life in accordance with restrictions,” says Prof. Yossi Leshem from Tel Aviv University and the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel.

New technologies were employed to host events, conducting small-scale tours and sharing its work online with a growing audience. One endeavor that was shared online and went viral, for example, was the feeding of a vulture chick by a “mama drone” that warmed the pandemic-stricken hearts of many thousands around the world.

“In these kinds of situations what you need to do is find the positive in everything and try to move forward with that,” Leshem says.

“As far as animals go, because people have been out less in nature and nature reserves, their options for moving around freely were much better,” he says. “Animals only profited from this; they had much more time to roam around and look for food.”

Animals, he adds, can give us perspective on this time of crisis and demonstrate that it’s not the end of the world as we know it. “Overall, this bird migration that I’m an expert on, is continuing. The corona didn’t change a thing for them.”

For Hassan Elziadna, a software engineer and entrepreneur, Covid highlighted the need for innovative and technological learning platforms.

The first-place winners of this year’s Startup Negev accelerator competition, Elziadna, his son, and a couple living nearby developed a learning platform for young children with learning disabilities to help them with their schoolwork. Despite Covid putting a halt to some of their plans, Elziadna – who consults for the projecton top of his job at a tech company – is convinced that there are opportunities in this strange time period.

“Covid did destroy some business and did a lot of damage, but it also opened up possibilities to think of solutions. That came with this new state in which people are shut in at home or their mobility is limited,” he says. “As is always the case, in difficult times and new situations there are both challenges and there are opportunities.”

What became clear to Elziadna this year is that it is possible, and even desirable, to work from home.

“It highlighted and forcefully demonstrated – since there was no other choice – that working from home, in high tech for example, can bring about a change for the better in utility, productivity and also in terms of costs.”

As the CEO of the Mishkenot Shaananim cultural center in Jerusalem and director of its annual international writers festival, Moti Schwartz spent the past year learning about moving cultural activities online.

“We were among the first to recognize that this thing is here to stay and isn’t simply coming and going, and we were among the first to do something about it,” he says, recounting the swift digital turnaround that the festival underwent back in May.

“The thing is to understand that this activity isn’t something we’re doing only because we have to because of the coronavirus,” he explains.

“Of course we want this to be over, and we very much want to work with a live audience, but we’ve seen the advantages online culture has,” he says. “This way we reach audiences in Europe, in the United States, in Tel Aviv and elsewhere. It changes the picture, and we get much wider exposure.

“On a personal level, I’m happy that we can carry on and create culture, and yet you still want it to be the same again,” he says.

When work at chef Shirel Berger’s celebrated vegan fine dining restaurant Opa came to a halt during the pandemic, it left her with time to think and with new lessons learned.

“I’m an ambitious woman and it’s very important for me to succeed, but the question is whether we stop every day to ask ourselves if we’re enjoying the journey,” she says.

“One of the strongest things was of course the issue of our life beforehand, on this ride,” she says. “We exploited our bodies and the planet in a way that doesn’t make sense, and this halt is justified.

“For me as a restauranteur, it’s about going truly local,” she says. “It’s about really being much closer to understanding how our food’s journey to our plates is substantial for the world and for the people who make it.”

This also holds true, she says, for our pandemic-era takeaway habits.

“We’re creating unreasonable amounts of trash,” she says. “At the end of the day, we’re not separate from this planet. It’s important to realize that we’re a part of something larger.”

David “Dush” Barashi was the first medical clown in the world to enter a corona ward – complete with the red nose, the jumpsuit and all the protective gear. The experience was similar to those he’s had in international disaster areas.

“You understand something very clearly. In this kind of chaotic situation, the things that should motivate you are positive dynamics, solidarity and giving unconditionally and without limits. Once you’re in that state of mind everything starts to look much better,” he says.

“I’m not the type of person who sits aside in crucial moments or fateful situations. I can’t sit aside and watch,” he explains. “I’m not giving up in the face of this pandemic. I see the pandemic as grounds for renewal and creativity.”

Barashi accompanied corona patients who were cut off from their families, helped them communicate with the outside world and brought them happiness and laughter in their time of need.

“In any kind of situation, you can change your perspective on reality and then reality will change.”

Yaron Daniely, who heads the aMoon Alpha health venture capital fund, has three major conclusions from this past year.

First, that the pandemic didn’t slow down investment. Second, investments became much more open and global during the pandemic, with investors and companies looking beyond their immediate environment into a larger virtual network. Third, that the once-specialized field of health technology has moved into the public domain.

“Now everyone understands health,” he says. “We’re seeing a kind of openness from both investors and entrepreneurs to entering the world of health. That’s an important thing.”

On a personal level, Covid has given him respite from a busy lifestyle.

“For the past 15 years I’ve been living on planes,” he notes. “I’m now nearing a year without traveling abroad and I think that that’s a special thing, because it allows you both to get to know your natural surroundings a little better and to find places of peace, joy and leisure in your natural, local environment, which is wonderful.

“The time that was spent on planes and adjustments to time zones and this craziness of flying out for a meeting or two – important as they may be – it’s suddenly made time for many other things that if you’re not careful will fill up with work, but if you’re a little more careful can be filled with social and public action, which I’m trying to do more of.”

The Israeli Firqat Alnoor Orchestra recently made headlines for celebrating the Abraham Accords by performing the Emirati song “Ahebak” (“I Love You”).

Its success, says orchestra co-founder and manager Hana Ftaya, has to do with the deep breath that the group took during the pandemic.

“First of all, it was important for us as an orchestra to make every effort that our musicians won’t stay at home,” she says. “That’s something that really, really bothered me during the first lockdown.”

Once restrictions eased, the musicians were back at work – but instead of performing in front of live audiences as usual, they went into the studio to record classics from the Arab world, something that they previously never had time for.

“Thanks to this, we started thinking in other directions,” she says. “I feel that we’ve only progressed.”

The orchestra is now working on another video clip to celebrate the peace between Israel and Bahrain.

“I think that corona taught us all a lesson,” Ftaya says. “We all stopped, and not for a moment but for a long time. We stopped to reflect.”

Battae, an Ethiopian Israeli heritage center that focuses on the culture and history of Ethiopian Jewry, opened in Tel Aviv only a few months before the pandemic struck.

“The year started out amazing,” says founder Ashager Araro, recounting the dozens of people who came in every day to learn about Ethiopian Jewry through art, dance, music and food.

“Corona put an end to all this and we had to move over to a digital edition of all our programs,” she says. “It really was a serious challenge but to our delight we did, in fact, manage.”

During the pandemic, the center reached out to people and fundraised for its activities. Araro says creating these types of alliances was one of the things that she took with her from this time.

“It’s really heartwarming, this knowledge that it’s not only your dream and your work but something that other people very much believe in,” she says.

“I think that the main insight is that in the end, with all the difficulties involved, you need to find a way to convey the education product that you want to pass on. There’s always a way, no matter how dark and difficult it seems,” she says. “As exhausting, tiring and sometimes disappointing as it is, the goal is more important.”

“Professionally, I was very fortunate this year,” says comedic host and video creator Renny Grinshpan. “Obviously, there were no live opportunities or live hosting gigs. The fact that I’ve been offstage this year is really bizarre.”

On a personal level, Grinshpan is part of another pandemic trend.

“I joined the corona baby boom,” she jokes. “It’s the perfect time to get into pregnancy. There’s nothing going on and you’re not going to experience social FOMO. Corona set a nice stage for feeling pregnant and tired and not wanting to do anything,” she adds.

“Like every year, I think the conclusion is to appreciate what we have, always,” she notes.

“I think it’s good to recognize the relationships that we have, especially the close relationships because those are the people we’re able to see. I’ve been especially grateful for my husband this year, because it’s been just me and him.”

“I had an extremely interesting past few months with corona,” says 17-year-old high school student Eliora Weiss. “I actually found it be quite helpful personally.”

This is because Covid regulations have confined lessons for Weiss’ age group to the online sphere for many months. In the classroom setting, Weiss finds it challenging to divide her attention between listening to teachers and taking notes. Classes on Zoom enable her to fully concentrate on the teacher.

“It’s allowed me to record lessons and focus on listening,” she explains. “It was able to give me a backup plan and not leave me super stressed about doing everything simultaneously.”

Outside of school hours, Weiss managed to maintain her social life by meeting friends for classes in the park, handing out food parcels with her youth group and even running four times a week with a group of friends, all according to regulations. She also volunteered at farms.

“I’d say corona has given me a break to find out new things that I’m interested in and try new things that I hadn’t had time for, so I really learned a lot about myself and my peers.”",The surprising lessons we learned from Covid-19,www.israel21c.org

However, the Republic Day parade of this year will be very different from previous years as it is for the first time that it will be held amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Here are the misses/curtailments due to COVID-19 and new additions in the Republic Day parade 2021.

1) This year, only 25,000 spectators will witness the Republic Day parade. Last year, 150,000 spectators were allowed. The number of media persons, too, has been cut from 300 to 200.

2) The spectators will watch and notice various new things. Jawans will be seen wearing masks and instead of 12X12 contingent system, this year it will be 12X8 contingent system. It means, instead of 144 jawans, there will be 96 jawans in one contingent.

3) Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Republic Day Parade this year will end at the National Stadium instead of going up to the Red Fort where it usually concludes. The distance for the march has been reduced by 50 per cent. According to Major General Alok Kacker, the contingent strength too has been reduced from 144 to 96 in wake of the pandemic.

4) The veteran marching contingent or tableaux will not be present this year and no child below the age of 15 will take part in the parade.

5) This will be the first R-Day parade without a chief guest in more than five decades. UK PM Boris Johnson, who had initially accepted India's invitation to be a chief guest, had cancelled his visit due to the rapid rise of Covid-19 cases in the United Kingdom. There was no chief guest during the Republic Day parade in 1952, 1953 and 1966 before this.

1)The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) for the first time will have its own tableau during the Republic Day parade. ""This year we will be having our own tableau and its theme will be combat skills of CRPF in conflict zones. Also, this year, all jawans will be wearing masks and will be maintaining social distancing as told by the government,"" said Inspector General, Training, CRPF RK Yadav, the reserve force.

2)CRPF tableau is set to wow spectators with a display of panoramic four-eyed night vision goggles (NVGs), a warfare gadget similar to the ones used by United States Navy SEALs in their operation to eliminate Osama Bin Laden. The goggles, also known as the 'king of night vision', are expected to be the centre of attraction in the first tableau of CRPF commandos marching down Rajpath. The specially-equipped goggles provide a 120-degree vision to commandos at night, just like viewing with naked eyes. They are lightweight and can be worn on the helmet during night operations.

3) A total of 38 Indian Air Force (IAF) aircraft and four helicopters of the Indian Army will participate in the flypast at the Republic Day parade on January 26 this year. The formations that will be seen during the parade include 'Rudra', 'Sudharshan', 'Rakshak', 'Eklavya' and 'Brahmastra'.

4) According to Indian Air Force, the newly inducted Rafale fighter aircraft will feature in the Republic Day parade and culminate the flypast by carrying out the 'Vertical Charlie' formation.

5) A Bangladeshi tri-service contingent will lead the first ten rows of the Republic Day parade in New Delhi to commemorate 50 years of the Liberation War. The contingent will be lead by the Bangladesh Army which will be in the first six rows, the next two rows will be led by the Bangladesh Navy and the last two rows will comprise of Bangladesh Air Force.

6) Indian Navy's tableau will showcase its stellar role as a credible force during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. As per a statement issued by the Indian Navy, the theme of the tableau for the 2021 Republic Day Parade is titled 'Indian Navy Combat Ready, Credible and Cohesive'.

7) The upgraded Schilika weapon system will roll down in Rajpath for the first time this year in the Republic Day parade, led by the only woman contingent commander from the Army.

""The upgraded Schilka to roll down Rajpath for the first time this year. It can track and shoot enemy targets up to 2 kilometers on the ground and about 2.5 kilometers in the air,"" Captain Preeti Chowdhary told ANI.

Divyangi Tripathi, who topped the CBSE class XII exams in Gorakhpur has been invited to witness the Republic Day Parade from the Prime Minister's Box in Delhi, along with other meritorious students from across the country. Divyangi had scored 99.6 per cent in the CBSE exams last year.

""I am very excited about this. It's a very good initiative launched by the Government. Students from all sections of society are selected without any discrimination,"" said Tripathi on receiving the invitation from the government.

Uttar Pradesh's tableau will feature a replica of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, which is currently under construction. It will also display the culture, tradition and art related to the temple town.

The Republic Day Tableau of Punjab for 2021 will reflect the theme of the unparalleled and supreme sacrifice of Ninth Sikh Guru Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur.

Uttarakhand's tableau will represent 'Kedarkhand' in Republic Day parade. The front portion of the tableau displays the state animal musk deer, state bird monal pheasant and state flower Brahmakamal whereas behind these a model of the Kedarnath temple compound has been displayed along with devotees.","Republic Day parade: What's new, what's curtailed due to Covid-19 on January 26",www.livemint.com
547,548,https://mb.com.ph/2021/01/24/wuhan-marks-a-year-since-covid-lockdown-as-brazil-faces-protests/,"Thousands of people in Brazil protested on Saturday against President Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, on the anniversary of the Chinese city of Wuhan beginning its 76-day lockdown.

Governments in several countries meanwhile, scrambled to put in place new restrictions to counter surging caseloads.

Europe faced a worsening struggle with production woes hitting supply of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine as well as the Pfizer/BioNTech shot.

Around the world, more than 2.1 million people have died of Covid-19 since it emerged in China in December 2019, with over 98 million infected.

In the world’s worst-hit country, US President Joe Biden warned America’s death toll could pass 600,000, the highest estimate yet that would mark a devastating rise on the 400,000 fatalities so far.

Leftist parties and organizations organised the protests in Brazil which saw some 500 vehicles paraded down the capital Brasilia’s Esplanade of Ministries blaring their horns. Painted slogans included “Bolsonaro Out,” “Impeachment Now” and “Vaccination for Everyone”.

Hundreds of cars formed similar protests in other cities, including Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.

Brazilian scientists have warned that the country faces running out of vaccine doses and basic equipment like syringes, just as its vaccination campaign gets underway — and some blame the government.

In the Chinese city of Wuhan earlier Saturday, all the signs were of recovery.

Humming traffic, bustling sidewalks, and citizens packing parks and public transport underscored the scale of the recovery in the metropolis of 11 million where the pathogen first emerged before going global.

“I think Wuhan is quite safe now, safer than my hometown and most places in China,” 21-year-old resident Wang Yizhe said.

In Hong Kong however, thousands of people in Jordan, one of the city’s poorest and most densely-packed districts, were ordered to stay at home on Saturday unless they could show a negative test, in the city’s first lockdown.

AstraZeneca told AFP late Friday that “lower yield” at one of its vaccine-making sites would affect deliveries across Europe.

Although German and French ministers tried to reassure the public of a steady supply, other countries were less willing to accept the delays without protest.

Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte called the delays “unacceptable” and said the government was considering legal action against AstraZeneca.

Deliveries of Pfizer-made shots to the continent’s countries are already behind schedule as the US firm upgrades capacity at a Belgian plant.

At a meeting with AstraZeneca representatives, the EU Commission “insisted on a precise delivery schedule on the basis of which member states should be planning their vaccination programmes”, Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides tweeted.

Already cleared for use in Britain, EU authorities are expected to give the vaccine the green light at the end of January.

On Friday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was “some evidence” the new strain first detected in the country “may be associated with a higher degree of mortality” as well as being more infectious.

The World Health Organization provided reassurance that fabric masks should still work to hinder the spread of new variants from Britain, South Africa and Brazil.

However, Norwegian capital Oslo toughened health restrictions after the British variant was found in a retirement home, closing all but essential shops and asking people to restrict movements.

The Netherlands introduced its first curfew since World War II, from 9 pm to 4:30 am.

And a French government source told AFP a new lockdown in the country looked increasingly likely because of the spread of the British strain.

Across the Atlantic, newly installed President Biden stepped up federal aid even as he gave his highest estimate yet of the eventual toll.

“The virus is surging,” he said. “We’re at 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000.”

And in the Colombian capital of Bogota, residents were under their third weekend of quarantine in a row, meaning the closure of all non-essential shops in the city of eight million from Friday at 8 pm until Monday at 4 am.

In Mexico, where hospitals have been overwhelmed and over 146,000 have died, people are queueing for hours to buy oxygen to care for the growing numbers fighting coronavirus at home.

In Wuhan, a team of World Health Organization experts was still in hotel quarantine ahead of a mission to investigate the source of the virus.

“All hypotheses are on the table,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a news conference in Geneva.

“And it is definitely too early to come to a conclusion of exactly where this virus started, either within or without China,” he added.

But there was good news on Friday for poorer nations, as the WHO and pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer announced a deal for up to 40 million initial doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be made available to them through the Covax global pool.

A separate deal, brokered by international agencies working with the WHO, will supply developing nations with tens of millions of rapid antigen tests at half the usual $5 price.",Wuhan marks a year since Covid lockdown as Brazil faces protests,mb.com.ph
548,549,https://newsoninvest.com/britain-must-rethink-its-national-security-law/,"The writer is a specialist regulatory adviser and former head of The Office of Fair Trading (now the Competition and Markets Authority)

Last November, a significant piece of legislation was introduced in the UK parliament that in more normal times would have provoked far greater coverage and concern.

Although it has been overshadowed by Covid and Brexit, the new National Security and Investment Bill threatens to change the investment environment in Britain radically — though few companies yet realise the extent of its impact. Peter Mandelson, a former UK business secretary, has described the bill as “a powerful deterrent to foreign direct investment”.

The bill introduces a new regime for monitoring inward investment on national security grounds. It requires any investment in a company in one of 17 industrial sectors that amounts to more than 15 per cent of the company’s value to be notified to a new government body: the Investment and Security Unit. For other sectors, notification is voluntary. The bill gives the government power to block a transaction if the ISU has concerns.

Such legislation captures the zeitgeist of the times. Other advanced economies have also recently introduced or extended laws to protect sensitive industries from foreign takeover. But this is far more than the UK playing catch-up in a worldwide outbreak of protectionism. It goes way beyond what has been introduced elsewhere — in two ways.

First, the scope is incredibly wide. It covers all sectors of the economy, and the investment threshold for mandatory notification is incredibly low. The UK government will even be able to intervene in cases involving businesses that have no UK assets, because the law will cover foreign companies that are active, or sell goods and services, in Britain.

Second, the powers of intervention are draconian and can be applied retrospectively. The government can “call in” deals up to five years after they have been completed, and it then has the power to declare them to be null and void. This applies to any investments made after the bill was introduced.

The threat of such drastic action means investors will want to play safe — especially as there is no definition in the bill of what actually constitutes “national security”. Before going ahead with any deal, participants will be keen to seek full clearance from the ISU — an organisation that does not yet exist. When it does, the body will be expected to handle hundreds of times more deals than are currently investigated for national security. That may lead to long waiting times and, perhaps, some investors seeking other homes for their money.

Ironically, two days before the bill was introduced to parliament, the prime minister launched a new “Office for Investment”, set up specifically to improve the UK’s ability to attract foreign investors. That is sensible, as there is clear evidence that foreign direct investment increases productivity. But the security bill ensures this new office will start with at least one hand tied behind its back.

The most worrying aspect of the bill, however, is that it will encourage any vested interest that does not like the look of a deal to lobby politicians to call it in for investigation on national security grounds. Regulatory delays or uncertainty can kill deals. Foreign investment into wind-farm projects could be stymied by a complaint from competing energy firms. A takeover could be held up by workers objecting to job relocation. At present, ministers can say they lack the ability to intervene, but the bill will change all that. It will be a charter for economically wasteful lobbying amid Kafkaesque bureaucracy.

At a broader level, the legislation is simply misdirected. It buys into conspiracy theories about malevolent foreigners itching to buy up corporations in order to steal hard-won secrets. When introducing the bill, the former business secretary Alok Sharma said that “hostile actors should be in no doubt that there is no back door to the UK”. How can direct investment in a company be described as a secret “back door”?

In most of the 17 mandatory sectors identified by the bill, national security risks lie more with people and knowhow than with capital. Why would malevolent foreigners buy expensively into companies when they can simply try to hire a few key employees who carry valuable intellectual property in their heads? Or when they can recruit leading academics from university research departments?

In the US, the FBI is well aware of this latter possibility and recently sharpened its focus on America’s key universities, asking a number of them specifically to monitor the information that their Chinese research students can access. The interests of national security are better served by steps that target the risk directly than by threatening to staunch the economic lifeblood of foreign direct investment.

549,550,https://www.africaleader.com/news/267625238/nissan-magnite-bookings-cross-35k---5-units-exported-in-dec-2020,"Nissan Magnite has created a furore in the Indian automotive market ever since it was launched a month back. The Japanese carmaker has already received an overwhelming response as far as bookings are concerned. The subcompact UV has raked in 35,000 bookings ever since its launch last month.

In a segment where competition is stiffening with each passing day, Magnite has been able to attract a sizeable audience. The company is now looking to scale up its production capacity as for now the waiting period has stretched beyond nine months.

Ramping up the production is necessary since Nissan is not only planning to cater to domestic demand but also planning to retail it in overseas markets. Earlier we had reported that the Japanese brand is looking at the possibility of launching the new subcompact UV in other international markets.

Nissan has big plans for Magnite and India will become the export hub for the subcompact SUV. The company has identified two potential markets for Magnite to be shipped- which are South Africa and Indonesia. As of now the company's focus is on the domestic market and to cater to the demands of Indian consumers.

First batch of 5 units of Magnite have already been exported. One of these units was used in the crash test conducted by ASEAN NCAP recently. In this crash test, Magnite scored a 4 star safety rating.

Nissan already exports made in India Datsun Redi-Go, Go and Go+ to South Africa and given Magnite's response in the Indian market, the carmaker is hopeful is reviving its fortunes overseas as well. Its buzz in India can be gauged by the fact that the company till now has received over 2 lakh inquiries for the sub-4 meter compact SUV. It was earlier reported that due to the ongoing crisis of Covid-19 exports had hit rock bottom in 2020.

The manufacturer also faced issues related to supply chain management but with markets opening up in recent months and restoration of supply chain management, the company's first priority is to fulfill the demands of Indian buyers. Nissan, as a mark of appreciation towards its customers has decided not to increase Magnite prices baring the base trim.

The company was supposed to increase the prices starring January this year but instead has decided to extend the introductory price offered in five trims namely- XL, XE, XV, XV Premium and XV Premium (O) and spread across two engine options and as many gearbox options. Its current prices start at Rs 5.49 lakh and go up to Rs 9.59 lakh (both prices ex-showroom). In spec-to-spec comparison, it is by far the most affordable sub-4 meter compact SUV in India.

The Nissan Magnite is powered by a 1.0 liter naturally aspirated engine and 1.0 liter turbo charged engine generating 71 hp and 96 Nm and 99 hp and 160 Nm respectively mated to 5 speed manual and CVT automatic gearbox options.

Nissan has released its accessories list for its subcompact UV Magnite and offers three packages namely Essential, Styling and Premium. Nissan is offering three accessory packages namely Essential, Styling and Premium which are priced at Rs 2,249, Rs 4,799, and Rs 8,999 respectively.",Nissan Magnite Bookings Cross 35k - 5 Units Exported In Dec 2020,www.africaleader.com

The task force's goals include sensitivity training at the council's member mosques, a communitywide summer service challenge, a yearlong public relations campaign, grants for diversity and inclusion in youth programs, and a Muslim Day of Action.

The council is an umbrella group for more than 60 member organizations, including mosques, Islamic schools and community groups serving more than 400,000 Muslim Americans in the greater Chicago region. Collectively, they represent Muslims of varying ethnicities, races and cultures.

Training sessions are aimed at helping community members examine policies that foster racism, develop tangible solutions to address inequities, and become anti-racist advocates, CIOGC Executive Director Abdullah Mitchell said.

""Police reform (is) clearly one of the hot topics right now,"" Mitchell said. ""How do we change practices around police engagement with communities of color? One of the biggest challenges is to keep at the forefront ... the importance of this work, to raise their sensitivity of the injustices that African American and other communities of color are actually experiencing. The concern is, will people's attention to this matter wane over time, because it is going to take time to bring about the necessary change.""

Another area of focus is improving access to health care for minorities.

The council launched a prototype for a community nursing program at Islamic Foundation North in Libertyville in partnership with Advocate Health. Its goal is educating people about making better health choices and providing nutrition counseling for communities of color.

Mitchell hopes the program can be duplicated in other communities. The task force also will work with food pantries serving communities of color to promote better nutrition, he added.

Hanover Park village leaders are considering a new diversity, equity and inclusion ordinance recommending allocation of funding and resources for cultural competency training, community surveys, embedding equity metrics into village strategic plans and annually reviewing progress.

The ordinance also outlines parameters for when Hanover Park Police Department can interact with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Hanover Park's population is comprised of 34% immigrants and 67% people of color.

In 2019, community members asked the village board for clarity around police interactions with ICE. The board directed the Cultural Inclusion & Diversity Committee to draft a resolution or ordinance addressing those concerns.

Committee members reviewed recent state laws aiding immigrants and welcoming ordinances in other municipalities, and consulted with organizations, including the National League of Cities Race, Equity, and Leadership Council, village Trustee Sharmin Shahjahan said.

Its metrics to define and measure safety and a sense of belonging will serve ""as a long-term road map for Hanover Park to go beyond platitudes to live up to its tagline as America's Global Village,"" she added.

The village board will discuss the ordinance at its February meeting. View the draft ordinance at hpil.org.

552,553,https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/government-urged-to-help-fish-traders-whose-eu-exports-are-banned-altogether,"Centuries Old Shellfish Traders Are Facing Collapse After EU Exports Are Banned Altogether

Since January 1, shellfish that are caught in UK but are not ready for human consumption have been barred from entering the EU. These shellfish – known in the industry as wild harvested live bivalve molluscs (LMBs) – include mussels, cockles, and scallops, and up until the end of 2020, were caught in British waters and then processed once they had reached the continent.

But that trade, which has brought millions of pounds into British coastal communities in the southwest of England, Morecambe Bay, Orkney and elsewhere, has totally ground to a halt.

“Without the EU customers, we wouldn’t exist as professional fishermen,” said Steve Manning, whose family in Flookburgh, Cumbria has caught shellfish on Morecambe Bay since the eighteenth century.

“We have been building these customers for years and we have some great family businesses in France, mainly Brittany, with whom we’ve not only become business partners, but great friends,"" he said.

“Our main worry is that the customers who we deal with – I have been sending to one family in France since 1999 – are going to find other suppliers, because they need the shellfish. It’s not just about quality, it’s about reliability.”

Exports to France account for 95% of the family’s sales, with the rest sold locally and to elsewhere in Europe. Manning’s family is one of a dozen in Flookburgh whose livelihoods have been put at risk by the ban, which the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says it is trying to rectify but admits that it currently has no control over.

The department led by George Eustice says the ban will remain in place until at least April 21st, when the EU plans to implement new Animal Health Regulations which are set to allow the resumption of wild harvested LMB imports from the UK.

“We are working to find a solution for the interim period,"" a DEFRA spokesperson told PoliticsHome.

However, many shellfish traders are already struggling financially and won’t last that long, according to Sarah Horsfall of the Shellfish Association of Great Britain (SAGB).

She told PoliticsHome that she “absolutely” expected some businesses affected by the ban to collapse before end of April, as the industry has already suffered financially from having their main customers, restaurants, close their doors for three coronavirus lockdowns.

“The resilience and ability to ride out the rough patches has pretty much gone already in the industry. We are looking at very, very difficult situations for people,” she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week announced that fish traders whose exports to the EU have been disrupted since the end of the Brexit transition period would each be entitled to up to £100,000 worth of compensation. Businesses must provide evidence of financial losses in order to receive the support.

Horsfall said she was concerned that some smaller and family-run shellfish businesses with very few staff might not be entitled to financial support as they aren’t registered fishing vessels.

“It is very unclear at the moment and we are still waiting for the details to be released,” she said.

Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron, who represents Manning’s constituency of Westmorland & Lonsdale, said the ban was “yet another devastating blow for British fisherman” and called on the government to provide “as much support as humanly possible”.

He told PoliticsHome: “With no prior warning, these fishermen now find themselves in a position when their income has dropped off a cliff and the future of their livelihoods has been thrown into serious doubt.""

Countless fish traders who are allowed to export to the EU have had orders cancelled by European customers due to time-consuming paperwork creating lengthy delays. Some Scottish boats have resorted to landing in Denmark and having their fish processed there, in order to circumvent disruption in the UK.",Centuries Old Shellfish Traders Are Facing Collapse After EU Exports Are Banned Altogether,www.politicshome.com

Nearby homes were damaged and several cars destroyed as the fire raged on, Okowa said.

554,555,https://www.hollandsentinel.com/news/20210123/granholm-to-shed-investments-if-confirmed-by-senate/1,"Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, whom President Joe Biden has nominated to be his energy secretary, will divest of any assets she holds related to energy companies and leave the board of an electric bus company, giving up millions in stock options, if she is confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

Granholm’s financial disclosure and a signed agreement to divest of holdings and leave positions that might create the appearance of a conflict of interest were filed this week with the Office of Government Ethics.

Granholm will be the subject of a confirmation hearing with the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on Wednesday. That will be followed at some point by a vote in committee on her nomination and a vote in the full U.S. Senate to confirm her.

In her ethics agreement, Granholm, who served as governor from 1993 to 2011, said she has already resigned as an adjunct professor at the University of California Berkeley and her position as an analyst with CNN, for which she was paid $200,000 a year. She also said she would resign when confirmed from the boards of Proterra, the bus company based in California, giving up future stock options and divesting of those she has already vested in, and shipbuilder Marinette Marine, based in Wisconsin.

A consulting firm she owns with her husband, Dan Mulhern, will continue to operate to manage its own investments, she said, but will not provide consultations. She also plans to divest in a number of investments that could be seen as a conflict, including those in Duke Energy, First Solar and Ford Motor, which has received Energy Department funding in the past. She also said she will not be involved in any decision that Proterra could be a party to for at least a year following her divestment.

Earlier this week, ABC News detailed the contents of Granholm’s financial disclosure, noting she and Mulhern had between $4.4 million and $16.8 million in assets, including up to $5 million in stock options from Proterra. On Friday, the Michigan Republican Party issued a news release calling Granholm’s investments and positions “a troubling revelation,” with no mention of her signed agreement to divest of those holdings and leave those positions.

555,556,https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/franchise-shift-gatineau-software-firm-acquired-us-franchise-management-giant,"A Gatineau firm whose software helps some of Canada’s best-known chains track their stores’ performance is now part of a U.S. franchise management giant.

Virginia-based FranConnect announced this week it has acquired LavaBlast Software, which makes a subscription-based platform used by franchisors to maintain consistent standards across their operations. Financial terms of the deal, which closed Jan. 14, were not made public.

Launched 14 years ago by a pair of University of Ottawa software engineering grads, LavaBlast ​– which did business under the name FranchiseBlast ​– has more than 100 customers. They include Recipe Unlimited Corp., the company behind Swiss Chalet, Harvey’s and other Canadian restaurant brands, as well as Cinnabon parent company Focus Brands, BeaverTails and Smoke’s Poutinerie.

Co-founder Jason Kealey said while the Gatineau company had become a dominant player in the Canadian franchise management industry, it’s still relatively unknown south of the border. He said joining forces with FranConnect ​– a global enterprise with about 800 customers ​– will help the firm push into new markets.

“I’m really excited to have the opportunity to have our software in the hands of all those brands,” he told OBJ.

Kealey will now take on the role of vice-president of strategy for the U.S. company, while co-founder Etienne Tremblay will become FranConnect’s vice-president of engineering. Both executives, along with the Gatineau firm’s other 13 employees, will remain based in the National Capital Region.

Kealey sees the decision to sell to a larger foreign entity as a step forward for the local firm, which joined Invest Ottawa’s accelerator program in 2018 and also took part in the C100 48 Hours in the Valley program that connects Canadian companies with partners in Silicon Valley.

“When they outlined their strategy, it was very, very similar to the strategy we’ve been pursuing,” he said.

“For me, it’s kind of a leap ahead into the future in the sense that we’ll be able to have a bigger impact on ensuring franchises are profitable and operations are streamlined so everybody’s happy. That’s always been our goal.”

Besides helping chains monitor franchisees’ sales and expenses, FranchiseBlast also offers a checklist to ensure that franchised fast-food restaurants, for example, follow the same recipes across all their locations.

In the wake of the pandemic, it added new tools to track whether franchisees are complying with measures to help rein in the spread of the virus such as installing plexiglass and signs that ask customers to follow physical distancing protocols.

FranConnect vice-president of marketing Ian Walsh said FranchiseBlast is an ideal fit because it adds new offerings to the U.S. firm’s suite of products.

“With COVID, when you start to get into things around health and safety ​– from a regulatory perspective but also just for the safety of your customers and your employees ​– this goes from an operational excellence play to a must-do in a lot of cases,” he said. “We think a lot of our customers in the market at large will be interested in what FranchiseBlast brings to the table. We’re super excited about this.”",Franchise shift: Gatineau software firm acquired by U.S. franchise management giant,www.obj.ca

In a move that is expected to escalate tensions between China and its neighbours, Beijing has passed a law that gives power to its coastguard to fire on foreign vessels and demolish structures built in disputed waters, South China Morning Post reported.",New China law gives coastguards power to fire foreign vessels in disputed waters,www.livemint.com
559,560,https://www.hongkongherald.com/news/267625697/china-gives-coastguard-power-to-fire-on-foreign-vessels,"Beijing [China], January 24 (ANI): In a move that is expected to escalate tensions between China and its neighbours, Beijing has passed a law that gives power to its coastguard to fire on foreign vessels and demolish structures built in disputed waters, South China Morning Post reported.

China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, on Friday passed the coastguard law that empowers the coastguard to use ""all necessary means"" to deter threats posed by foreign vessels in waters ""under China's jurisdiction"". It will also allow the coastguards to launch pre-emptive strikes without prior warning if commanders deem it necessary.

The SCMP reported that it is yet to ascertain whether the law will be applied to all waters claimed by Beijing, which has a number of competing claims with its neighbours in the East and South China Seas.

Under the new bill, coastguard personnel can demolish structures built or installed by other countries in Chinese-claimed waters and board and inspect foreign ships in the area.

Chinese coastguard ships have played a leading role in asserting China's maritime claims, including in fishing disputes off Indonesia's Natuna Islands and the stand-off with Vietnam over Vanguard Bank.

China claims virtually entire South China Sea, something which is contested heavily by several countries in the region. As per the report, some parts of the waters that fall within Manila's exclusive economic zone was renamed West Philippine Sea by the Philippine government.

China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system.

China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.

Beijing's rising assertiveness against counter claimants in the East and South Sea has resulted in unprecedented agreement across the Indo-Pacific.

Japanese diplomats have previously lodged a protest against the growing presence of Chinese coastguard vessels near the Diaoyu, or Senkaku, Islands in the East China Sea.

Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Friday that the new law would clarify the functions and authority of the coastguard forces and that it was in line with international practice. Hua added that China will continue to manage its differences with Japan through dialogue. Collin Koh, a research fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, said the ambiguous language in the law could heighten the risk of miscalculation in the disputed waters.

""[Though] promulgating a coastguard law (CGL) is a general practice that other countries have been doing (such as Vietnam back in late 2018), China's CGL contains ambiguous language that begs proper definition, for instance 'waters under national jurisdiction',"" said Koh.

""This also means the law bestows ... the authority to use force to assert those rights against other foreign parties even when operating in the latter's legitimate [exclusive economic zone],"" he said. (ANI)",China gives coastguard power to fire on foreign vessels,www.hongkongherald.com

Starting today, users of Google Arts & Culture will now be able to see a new MOCA virtual exhibition titled 

 

Trial by Fire marks the one-year anniversary of a fire at 70 Mulberry Street that occurred on January 23, 2020 and tells the story of the Museums race against the clock to retrieve, rescue, and repair its archives, the largest collection of Chinese American artifacts in the world. Trial by Fire is an original MOCA exhibition written, researched and compiled from the Museums daily social media posts, primary sources such as videos and images, public records and news reports that documented the first critical weeks of the fire, its aftermath and recovery effort afterward. 

 

In addition, over 200 digitized high-resolution images from MOCAs collections will be available for the first time on the platform as well as digital exhibits of With a Single Step: Stories in the Making of America, MOCAs permanent exhibition, and the My MOCA Story video project, a crowdsourced social-media storytelling project launched by MOCA at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Users will be able to experience for the first time a multimedia-augmented virtual tour of With a Single Step: Stories in the Making of America, MOCAs permanent exhibition that tells the story of 200 years of Chinese American history. Using the Street View feature, people can explore the Museum of Chinese in America virtually, selecting works that interest them and clicking to discover more or diving into the high-resolution images, where available. 

 

A specially designed Street View trolley took 360-degree images of selected galleries that were then stitched together, enabling smooth navigation of 9 rooms within the Museum such as Down with Monopolies! The Chinese Must Go!, a section which examines the political climate leading up to and the painful legacy of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act; and Building Community which showcases an old general store as a composite of salvaged objects and memories from Chinatown stores across America (Los Angeles, Boston, and New York City). 

 

Each of the 9 rooms shown in the virtual exhibition is enhanced and supplemented with video and audio to enable further immersion into the content of each section of the Museum. 

 

In addition, users of Google Arts & Culture will be able to watch videos from the My MOCA Story crowdsourced storytelling project. Following on the heels of MOCAs archives recovery from the 70 Mulberry Street fire and at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, MOCA launched the My MOCA Story project as a way for the public to respond to the anxieties of lockdown. 

 

The project prompted people to record 1-minute My MOCA Story videos of themselves showing and sharing the story behind a precious family heirloom in their home. Videos were submitted through MOCAs social media channels at #mymocastory or by emailing mymocastory@mocanyc.org. The project is ongoing and MOCA invites the public to share a My MOCA Story video which will be added to MOCAs Collections on Google Arts & Culture. 

 

The highly anticipated launch of MOCAs partnership with Google Arts & Culture is the Museums latest successful pivot towards adapting and sharing its curatorial, archival, and educational content via digital platforms. Since the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic in mid-March 2020 that forced museums across the U.S. to temporarily shutter their physical operations, MOCA has been offering live-streamed tours of its exhibitions, public programs, family festivals and educational workshops, and masterclasses to thousands of virtual attendees. In 2020, 65,000+ people attended MOCAs virtual programs and 4 million unique users viewed or engaged with MOCAs content on its social media channels.

563,564,https://therightscoop.com/come-on-in-china-biden-welcomes-foreign-interference-in-american-power-grid/,"President* Joe Biden has reversed an order by former* President Donald Trump preventing foreign powers like China and Russia from being involved with the U.S. power grid – a major national security issue.

National Pulse reports that Biden has “revoked a Trump-era executive order that sought to keep foreign countries and companies out of America’s bulk power systems – principally entities associated with the Chinese Communist Party,” and did so as part of his day one “green” agenda.

Anyone familiar with the green agenda knows that the real color is red, because it is all about revoking American power and ceding it to communist dictators and global socialism.

So no surprises here.

Section 7 of the massive order, which includes the revocation of the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, also revokes several climate and energy-focused executive orders penned by the Trump administration. Subpoint C notes that “Executive Order 13920 of May 1, 2020 (Securing the United States Bulk-Power System), is hereby suspended for 90 days.” The Trump-era order sought to ban, replace, and set new criteria on bulk-power system (BPS) electric equipment coming from a foreign country or national that poses a national security threat. “Foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in the United States bulk-power system, which provides the electricity that supports our national defense, vital emergency services, critical infrastructure, economy, and way of life. The bulk-power system is a target of those seeking to commit malicious acts against the United States and its people, including malicious cyber activities, because a successful attack on our bulk-power system would present significant risks to our economy, human health and safety, and would render the United States less capable of acting in defense of itself and its allies,” the introduction to the executive order read.

The State must intervene and do its constitutional duty to ensure these children receive education of a much higher quality.

Schools that were high performers decades ago (such as “Mother School” (St Gabriel’s, San Fernando); Boys’ RC on the Promenade; Newtown Boys’; Mucurapo Boys’ and Girls’; and Tranquillity) are no longer on the radar.

The scale of the problem can best be shown by demonstration, via the Academic Performance Index report of 2016, conducted under the auspices of The UWI, and published by the Ministry of Education.

The report showed widespread failure among denominational elementary schools, with very many of them in urban areas, particularly Port of Spain and environs having been deemed to be on “academic watch”, the equivalent of being on life support.

Schools documented as being in trouble included the following, by district: (a) Caroni: St David’s RC (b) North Eastern: Cumana RC, Sans Souci RC (c) Port of Spain: Ascension AC, Belmont Boys’ RC; Bethlehem Boys’ RC, Bethlehem Girls’ RC, Boissiere Village RC, Diego Martin Boys’ RC, Diego Martin Girls’ RC, Eastern Girls’ RC, Escallier AC, Gloster Lodge Moravian, Hockett Baptist, Mucurapo Boys’ RC, Nelson Street Boys’ RC, Petit Valley Boys’ RC, Rose Hill RC, St Agnes AC, St Rose’s Intermediate, Success RC, Upper Laventille (Our Lady) (d) St George East: Barataria Boys RC; Boug Mulatresse RC; Brasso Seco RC; Curepe (Fatima) RC; Malick Girl’ RC; Santa Cruz RC; St Benedict’s RC; St Mary’s Children Home AC; (e) St Patrick: Erin RC, Siparia Boys’ RC; Vance River RC; (f) South East: Fifth Company AC, La Lune RC; Marac Baptist; Poole RC; Sixth Company AC, St Stephens AC, Sisters Road AC; (g) Victoria: Sisters Road AC, Marabella Boys’ AC, Marabella Girls’ AC; (h) Tobago: Charlotteville AC; L’Anse Fourmi Methodist; Pentecostal Light and Life.

This is carnage, and a reason for rampant crime. Children who attend these schools have no futures.

As can bee seen, this has been a festering problem among denominational elementary schools serving African children, one about which the churches in question have been silent.

It should be noted that in 1917 in this country, 71 years after the Emancipation proclamation, the Shouters Prohibition Ordinance of Trinidad was passed, suppressing the Shouter Baptists. The Spiritual Baptists, who were banned in 1917, had their privileges restored in 1951. Their focus has been on recouping their religion, not on education. The Baptists did not piggy-back on the Concordat compromise, which really was a way in which the European church sought to extend its colonialising grasp from slavery into Independence.

It is the case that black people in the region were defenceless when it came to the role of the European church in their lives.

In her PhD thesis titled “Christian Slavery: Protestant Missions and Slave Conversion in the Atlantic World, 1660-1760”, done at Harvard University, Katharine Gerbner writes that “missionaries argued that slave conversion would solidify planter power, make slaves more obedient and hard-working, and make slavery into a viable Protestant institution”. Planters viewed their status as Protestants as inseparable from their identity as free Englishmen... They purchased pews, sought to memorialise themselves within the walls of the church. Churches served as a site for both punishment and politics—as the site of island elections and community bulletin board where white inhabitants could post news about stolen goods or runaway slaves.

Black people could not have a say in the churches during slavery. They do not have a say now. Nothing has changed following emancipation in 1838, and now two decades into the 21st century. The churches continue to exert historical rights to educate, even where it means abject failure of black children.

African children continue to be spoken for by these European churches, particularly Catholics and Anglicans, both running a sizeable share of schools.

What makes this more galling is that when one looks at the API data for denominational private elementary schools the picture is starkly different. These are schools for the children of one-percenters. For example, in Port of Spain district, the following private denominational schools were shown to be excelling: St Ursula’s, St Andrews, Maria Goretti, Maria Regina, St Monica’s, and Holy Faith. Black children are in the minority in Presentation College, San Fernando and Chaguanas.

A question can be raised here if by comparison we look to denominational secondary schools in Jamaica, where we find consistently that Immaculate Conception girl school (Catholic) is consistently one of the top performing schools in the country based on CSEC results. Results from 2019 show that the school had 100 per cent full passes. We also see St Hilda’s Diocesan High, an Anglican school, being a top CSEC performer with more than 98 per cent of their pupils getting five or more passes. In these schools, the majority of children are African.

In Grenada, Anglican High School is the top performing girl’s school.

Black children elsewhere in the Caribbean do not seem to be afflicted with the same cognitive impairment that some have theorised here.

Denominational schools are indifferent to the education of black children. Other strategies, such as civil society groupings, must now be considered as partners with the Government in the education of African children. There is need for consultation on this matter.

A judge set bail at $500,000 Saturday for Daniel Regalado, 27, who also faces felony and misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence.

Regalado was behind the wheel of a Chevy Impala when he allegedly veered into oncoming traffic about 9:35 p.m. Wednesday in the 4900 block of South Cicero Avenue and hit a Cadillac Escalade head-on, prosecutors said during a Saturday bail hearing.

Investigators determined Regalado had been driving 52 mph at the point of impact, and his blood alcohol level was registered at .457%, according to prosecutors.

Police said another SUV was unable to stop and also struck the Cadillac.

Cire Robinson, 12, of Oak Lawn, was riding in the Cadillac and pronounced dead about an hour after the crash, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office.

Regalado and two women in the Impala, ages 19 and 21, were taken to hospitals in serious or critical condition, police said. The driver of the Cadillac, a 51-year-old man, suffered a broken ankle, police said.

Regalado, a Little Village resident, was already facing three separate felony charges before the crash, including unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and manufacturing and delivering cannabis, prosecutors said.

(KT) - Kentucky State Police are investigating an officer-involved shooting in Grayson County that left a Caneyville man dead Thursday night.

The KSP Post at Elizabethtown says they received a call shortly before 10:30, Thursday night, from the Grayson County Sheriff’s Office, saying that there was an officer-involved shooting with two of their deputies.

Preliminary findings by investigators determined that the Grayson County Sheriff’s Office received information that a wanted subject, Brian Abbott, 34 of Caneyville, was at a residence on North Main Street in Caneyville.

When they arrived at the home, the two deputies made contact with Abbott, who was inside the residence armed with two knives. State Police say despite repeated commands for him to drop the knives, Abbott charged toward the deputies, leading one of them to fire his service weapon, striking Abbott three times.

The Grayson County Coroner’s Office pronounced Abbott dead at the scene. An autopsy has been scheduled for Friday at the Kentucky Medical Examiner’s Office in Louisville.

The two deputies involved were not injured in the incident, and both have been placed on administrative leave, pending the outcome of the investigation. Their names have not yet been released.

State Police say they were assisted at the scene by the Grayson County Sheriff’s Office, Leitchfield Police Department, Grayson County EMS, Caneyville Fire Department, Caneyville Police Department and the Grayson County Coroner’s Office.

Police released surveillance video of three men they say got into a verbal dispute with a 31-year-old woman outside of a liquor store last Monday at 5:52 p.m. on West 128th Street near Frederick Douglass Boulevard.

Police say two of the men kicked the victim multiple times, and a man in a red jacket bit the victim on her forehead.

The trio then allegedly stole the victim’s iPhone 11, valued at $750.

The victim was taken by EMS to a hospital, to be treated for a bite mark with broken skin to the face, pain and bruising.

“I think what they did was horrible. No one should be treated like that,” said Troy Mills, a customer at the liquor store. “What they did was totally disrespectful, I hope police get them.""

Police said the victim and two of the three men had all been inside the liquor store before the altercation.

“How did he bite her?” Damalah asked PIX11 News. ""It is like an animal.""

Police did not know what led up to the altercation, and only had a description of what the trio were wearing.

The first unidentified male wore a red jacket, the second wore a black jacket, and the third was in a red hooded sweatshirt with a denim vest over it, according to the surveillance video released by police.

“It’s heinous, it’s barbaric,” Marcus told PiX11 News. “This is the second incident recently of an assault against a woman. These men need to be taken off the streets,” he added.

Organizers called on state lawmakers to stiffen penalties for men convicted of assaulting women and the elderly.

Create a free profile to get unlimited access to exclusive videos, sweepstakes, and more!

On September 7, 1997, Brook Baker, a 19-year-old journalism student at Vincennes University in small town Indiana, was found viciously murdered in her bed.

The victim, who was discovered by her brother, was naked. She had 11 stab wounds. Bruising and evidence under her fingernails indicated that she had been violently restrained and sexually assaulted.

Investigators found no signs of a struggle in the rest of the home, which suggested there hadn’t been forced entry or a burglary, they told “One Deadly Mistake,” airing Saturday at 9/8c on Oxygen.

However, a number of things stood out as they examined the crime scene, according to Knox County prosecutor Hal Johnston. The water was running in the bathtub, which contained towels. The kitchen sink was filled with soapy water. There were knives in the sink, including a large one that was bent.

Authorities sent the knives out for analysis at the crime lab. One was identified by genetic material as the weapon used to kill Baker. “Science proved it,” said Johnson.

Detectives considered various persons of interest early in their investigation. Among them was a fellow journalism student who had dropped Baker off at a party earlier in the night she was murdered. There was a student who had a one-sided crush on her. The victim’s landlord, who not only had access to the off-campus house Baker rented but also a history of inappropriate sexual advances, was a potential person of interest.

All three men agreed to give DNA samples and were eventually cleared as suspects.

Investigators acknowledged that a week after Baker’s body was found they “were scrambling for leads.” They turned their attention to Baker’s work as a reporter. She was covering an alleged rape case involving one of the most powerful fraternities on campus.

One of the brothers had purportedly sexually assaulted a young woman and Baker was seeking to help the victim tell her story, according to “One Deadly Mistake.” Baker was met with intimidation by members of the fraternity because of her efforts.

Authorities painstakingly questioned and took DNA samples from the nearly five dozen frat brothers. There were no matches. Detectives were back at square one. “It was really, really frustrating,” they told producers.

The case went cold for almost two years, but was revitalized by an investigation involving another Vincennes University student, 21-year-old Erika Norman, who was reported missing on July 5, 1999.

Authorities searched Norman’s home, where they found blood on walls, dishes, and lamps but no signs of a forced entry or robbery.

In the bathroom, water was running in the tub, which contained a couch cushion from the living room. The use of the bathtub to clean up immediately recalled the Baker crime scene. It was a distinct deja vu.

“In all the murder cases I’ve worked, I’ve never seen anybody do anything like that before,” said Johnson. “Humans are creatures of habit. Killers are creatures of habit. They’ll kill the same way. They’ll clean up the same way. Why? Because it worked before.”

Detectives traced Norman’s whereabouts before she vanished. On July 3, the last time she was seen alive, she’d been with friends at a local bar. Witnesses told investigators that she’d been seen with Brian Jones, 22, a former Vincennes student with nothing more than a traffic ticket on his record.

Jones told investigators that he and Norman had watched a movie. He agreed to give a DNA sample and allowed authorities to search his car and home and have the clothes he’d worn the night he was with Norman. That outfit included a pair of shoes upon which an investigator noticed what looked like a bloodstain. Other traces of blood were also found in Jones’ car.

While awaiting lab analysis on the blood evidence, the case took another turn after 16 days of intensive searching for Norman. In Lawrence County, Illinois, a farm worker discovered human remains in a cornfield, reported the Chicago Tribune at the time. Dental records confirmed it was Erika Norman.

Crime lab analysis also confirmed that the blood on Jones’ shoe and inside his car was Norman’s. Jones’ DNA also matched genetic material found on Baker’s body.

After being questioned and arrested in the Norman case, he was arrested and charged on July 13 in the murder and rape of Brook Baker, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Jones pleaded guilty to murdering Erika Norman. The guilty plea in the Norman case was part of a plea agreement that took the death penalty off the table. He was sentenced to 60 years in prison.

Jones was later convicted in Knox County Superior Court of raping and fatally stabbing Brook Baker. During the trial, according to the Associated Press, the judge ruled the jury could not be informed that Jones had earlier pleaded guilty to killing Norman. Still, Jones was sentenced to life without parole for raping and killing Baker.

The campaign to remove them is being spearheaded by North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen but also has the backing of the powerful Common Sense group of Conservative MPs which this week also pushed for universities to be forced to protect free speech. Writing for the Sunday Express, Mr Bridgen highlighted the case of businessman and ex-police officer Harry Miller who had a Humberside police officer turn up at his workplace to “check his thinking” for getting involved in a transgender debate online after an individual took offence at a retweet and reported it as a hate crime. Shockingly, the case ended up in the high court where it was dismissed by a judge who compared the police force’s actions to the Gestapo. Mr Bridgen noted that hate speech laws were also the backdrop for companies like Twitter, Youtube and Facebook banning people like President Donald Trump or companies like Talk Radio. He said: “It is far from an easy task as regulation of language is inherently subjective however we cannot leave this matter up to the discretion of big tech bosses and High Court judges.

“They are not helped by British law defining hate crimes as ‘any criminal offence which is perceived by the victim, or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards someone based on a personal characteristic’. “To protect free speech and democracy, this legislation must be repealed.” Ipswich MP Tom Hunt, who was first elected in December 2019, is also leading efforts within the Common Sense group to overhaul hate speech laws. He is currently writing a chapter on law and order for a policy and vision book being produced by the group which includes a section on the problems with so called hate speech laws.

Mr Hunt told the Sunday Express how political opponents in Suffolk used the law to make vexatious allegations against him not long after he was elected after he used a column in his local newspaper to point out that statistically certain crimes in his area were being committed by a particular ethnic group. He said: “Leftwing campaigners were posting a link for people to report me to the police. It was completely political. “I was interviewed but no charges were brought because I had said and done nothing wrong. “As an MP I was at least in a position to take a stand against it but others would not be.” He added: “These laws are being used to attack free speech.”

There are concerns that the Scottish nationalist government under Nicola Sturgeon plans to extend hate speech to the point that people can be tried for comments made over their own dinner table. There was also anger that the Metropolitan Police interviewed historian David Starkey and activist Darren Grimes over a conversation they had on slavery in a podcast. A source close to Ms Patel warned that complete repeal could give police forces “free reign” in pursuing hate crimes. “Our worry is the police are using them for going after things that aren’t crimes,” the source added highlighting the Grimes case before confirming that “reform” is on the table.

A quote of the late great Ronald Reagan came to my attention recently in which he states ""If fascism ever comes to America, it will come in the name of liberalism."" Considering the current battles going in in the Western world over free speech, hate legislation and the rise of cancel culture, these words now look strangely prophetic. This is because we find ourselves in a situation where a combination of poorly thought out hate speech legislation together with the rapid expansion of big tech has outstripped the ability of the world’s legislators to regulate it, and we have sleepwalked into the creation of the kind of big tech power which would be beyond the dreams of many communist dictators. A power that for all of his faults, silenced the President of the United States whilst still providing a platform for regimes such as Chinese Communist Party who are overseeing genocide within their own Country.

It does not stop there, as when President Trump attempted to move to another social media network, it was removed from the Amazon, Apple and Google platforms. Whilst disagreeing with the actions of Donald Trump in recent weeks, it should not be the decision of big tech to silence him and this is the failure of legislation. This is recognised by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey who stated that blocking politicians like this “sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation”. We saw something similar in the UK recently with the temporary removal a few weeks ago of the Talk Radio channel from the google owned Youtube for violating YouTube’s community guidelines. It was reinstated later that day with the explanation that ‘we quickly remove flagged content that violate our Community Guidelines, including COVID-19 content that explicitly contradict expert consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organization.

As Talk radio rightly said “This sets a dangerous precedent and is censorship of free speech and legitimate national debate.” This again is an insidious attack on freedom of speech being facilitated and in part led by the big tech companies and aided by ill thought out hate speech legislation which is constantly used by big tech companies to hide behind when making judgments on what constitutes offence. Last year businessman and ex Police Officer Harry Miller had a Humberside Police Officer turn up at his workplace to ‘check his thinking’ for getting involved in a transgender debate online after an individual took offence at a retweet and reported it as a hate crime. The case was taken to the High Court where when describing the actions of Humberside Police, the judge drew from three of the most oppressive totalitarian regimes in modern history. 'In Great Britain, we have never had a Cheka, a Stasi or a Gestapo,' and ruled that the force unlawfully interfered with Mr Miller’s right to freedom of expression when they turned up at his place of work.

But as Mr Miller rightly stated after the trial ‘the court also said that the policing guidance used by forces across the UK, which defines a hate crime as 'any non-crime incident which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice against a person who is transgender or perceived to be transgender', was lawful. Bizarre as it sounds, according to this guidance, currently no evidence of hate is required for the hate element of a hate crime or hate incident; indeed, there is no need for any incident at all.’ One of our greatest comic actors and writers Rowan Athkinson also makes the point on the use of hate legislation when he recently stated ""The problem we have online is that an algorithm decides what we want to see, which ends up creating a simplistic, binary view of society. ""It becomes a case of either you're with us or against us. And if you're against us, you deserve to be 'cancelled'.

""It's important that we're exposed to a wide spectrum of opinion, but what we have now is the digital equivalent of the medieval mob roaming the streets looking for someone to burn. ""So it is scary for anyone who's a victim of that mob and it fills me with fear about the future."" The Humberside case is clearly bonkers and I don’t think those who pay their taxes and precepts to fund the Police would expect them to be doing or be a priority task. It’s clear that big tech and the Police are overreaching themselves and the UK and other Countries need to redefine the guidance and regulations given big tech and the Police. The EU through its Digital Services Act is looking to require big tech companies to do more to combat hate speech whilst reinforcing free speech but it likely to take two years to negotiate, and the benefit of Brexit is we can move much faster than this.

It is far from an easy task as regulation of language is inherently subjective however we cannot leave this matter up to the discretion of big tech bosses and High Court judges. They are not helped by British law defining hate crimes as ‘any criminal offence which is perceived by the victim, or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards someone based on a personal characteristic’ To protect free speech and democracy, this legislation must be repealed. Like many hastily rushed through covid regulations, it is a law that can be interpreted in whatever way you like and it is easy to see how the Police and Big Tech can become over zealous in its application. Unlike the SNP who are aiming to extend even further the powers with the Hate Crime and Public Order Bill, this Conservative Government should be seeking to better define hate crime in a way that restrains the power of big tech and avoids the Police wasting precious time on frivolous and trivial matters. Without these urgent legislative changes and despite Brexit being delivered in full only weeks ago, we will have actually have lost our freedom and our democracy.",Priti Patel to take axe to Tony Blair's hate speech laws fuelling woke cancel culture,www.express.co.uk

Tens of thousands of Russians responded by braving sub-zero temperatures, an often violent police response, and official warnings of a harsh crackdown to flood the streets in 107 cities across the country.

In Moscow — where police said 4,000 people came to protest but Reuters estimated there were 10 times as many — crowds stretched for kilometres in all directions from central Pushkin Square, clogging up sidewalks and blocking traffic as they spilled into the street.

As baton-wielding riot police in body armour and balaclavas moved in to arrest them, some protesters fended them off with snowballs or fought back to free detainees from custody. In Saint Petersburg, protesters breached a police barricade and marched through the city.

State media said that about 40 riot police in Moscow sustained minor injuries. The driver of a black car with government license plates and VIP beacon was hospitalised after protesters smashed his car and gouged out his eye, according to state newswire RIA Novosti.

Police had arrested 2,131 people by 4pm GMT, including 795 in Moscow and 309 in St Petersburg, according to independent watchdog OVD-Info.

Among them were Mr Navalny’s wife Yulia and top aide Lyubov Sobol, who were detained as soon as they arrived at the square. Ms Navalnaya was released a few hours later.

Russian officials opened several criminal investigations into the rallies, while authorities in Moscow said that 19 people with coronavirus had attended, making the rallies a health hazard.

The Kremlin’s children’s ombudsman, who had accused Mr Navalny of using his youthful following online as “human shields,” said that 15 underage protesters were arrested.

Schools and universities had warned students and the parents of children as young as 10 not to attend the protests.

The head of the Moscow office of consultancy firm McKinsey, which counts several government agencies and state companies as its clients, sent an email to staff banning them from protesting or expressing online support for the rallies.

McKinsey later told the Financial Times: “McKinsey supports its employees’ rights to participate legally and in a personal capacity in civic and political activities across the countries we operate. The recognition of these rights is unqualified.”

Several protesters said they had never attended a rally before but were galvanised by the Kremlin’s treatment of Mr Navalny, who faces up to 13 and a half years in prison on charges he says are retaliation for exposing Russia’s alleged role in his poisoning.

“I’m sick of all this stuff. I’m 19, Putin has been in power my entire life, and I don’t see any hope for the country,” said Anastasia, a student at a Moscow state university. “There’s poverty and state terrorism. And what they did to Navalny is outrageous and illegal.”

In Moscow, crowds chanted “Putin is a thief!” and “Free Navalny!” while passing cars sounded their horns in support and blared Changes, a Soviet-era rock anthem popular with protesters in Belarus.

Before the protest started, squads of police officers ran into the crowd and grabbed people, seemingly at random, prompting shouts of “Disgrace!” from onlookers.

Footage from Russia’s Far Eastern city of Vladivostok, where thousands had congregated, showed riot police chasing protesters down the street.

In Yakutsk, a city 8,000km east of Moscow, police arrested 30 people among the few hundred who braved temperatures of -50C to protest.

“I want Russia to be free. I support Navalny. I want a future for my children,” said Svetlana, 60, a retiree, attending the Moscow rally. “I’ve really had it. Everything is falling apart. There’s no healthcare and no pensions. I want things to change.”

Mr Navalny’s team hopes that the scale of the protests, especially in eastern and Siberian cities where anti-Kremlin activities are uncommon, will put pressure on Mr Putin’s administration to release him.

Mr Navalny was jailed on a charge of breaking the terms of a suspended sentence from 2014, which could see him imprisoned for three-and-a-half years. He also faces a fraud charge that carries a 10-year maximum sentence.

The Kremlin, which denies any role in the August nerve agent attack on Mr Navalny that almost killed him, has said the rallies are illegal. Police pre-emptively arrested many of Mr Navalny’s closest aides this week to prevent them from attending and warned social media companies they would be prosecuted for not deleting posts advertising the protests.

Moscow has said it will ignore calls of condemnation from western countries and their demands for Mr Navalny’s release, describing it as a domestic issue.","Russian police arrest over 2,000 in crackdown on pro-Navalny rallies",newsoninvest.com

The head prosecutor for Stafford County said Friday that the actions by the deputies were justified and that they will return to regular duty.

Thirty-eight-year-old George R. Batts Jr. of Richlands, North Carolina, was shot last Sunday morning by deputies who responded to a shooting at 1130 International Parkway in Stafford.

Batts is accused of shooting 47-year-old Ely Grimes before the deputies arrived.

578,579,https://www.crimeonline.com/2021/01/23/angry-police-detective-shoots-love-triangle-rival-15-times/,"An Alabama grand jury has indicted a former Birmingham detective in a “love triangle” shooting last April that left another woman dead.

Alfreda Fluker, 40, has been charged with capitol murder for the death of 43-year-old Kanisha Nicole Fuller and the attempted murder of Mario Theodore White, Fluker’s partner on the Birmingham Police Department’s Crime Reduction Team.

Fluker and White had been involved romantically for about a year, AL.com reported, but a state investigator testified at a hearing last summer that White and Fuller were having sex in White’s city-issued, unmarked police vehicle at the time of the shooting. Both White and Fluker were off-duty.

Fluker, a mother of three who had been with the Birmingham police for 15 years, was fired last year, and White later resigned.

Birmingham officers were alerted to the April 10 incident in Germania Park by the city’s Shot Spotter gunfire detection system. When they arrived, they found Fuller in White’s vehicle with multiple gunshots, including one to the head. Her own vehicle was found in the middle of a field at the park. Fuller was taken to UAB Hospital, where she was pronounced dead; White wasn’t injured.

State Bureau of Investigations agent Chris Lampley testified last June that White told him Fuller texted him as he was returning from a family member’s that night and met her at the park to talk about handing out flyers for a catering business she was starting. He said they talked from their own vehicles for about 15 minutes before Fuller got into his vehicle, and they continued to talk for about 10 minutes before the gunfire began.

Lampley testified that White told him he tried to drive out of the park, then remembered he had his gun and stopped to get it. When he stopped, Fluker stopped too. White said he “snatched” Fluker’s gun away and made sure it was empty, and the two argued. White said he pushed Fluker to the ground and went back to his vehicle, at which time Fluker left. She was later arrested at her mother’s home, as CrimeOnline previously reported.

Lampley said 15 shell casings were found on the scene, all matching Fluker’s service weapon, which was never found.

When Fluker’s attorney questioned Lampley, the agent said that White and Fuller had been engaged in sexual activity in his police vehicle when the shooting began.

Fluker has been held without bond since her arrest. No trial date has been set.

The resort intends to add a boutique hotel nearby to accommodate the USGA for the five U.S. Opens it will stage here through 2047.

Add to that a new subdivision off Blake Boulevard; a new neighborhood near Lake Pinehurst; a new cancer center under construction on the FirstHealth campus; new development on N.C. 5 at the village’s southern boundary; and the ongoing infill construction of homes around the village.

Pinehurst’s current development ordinance is not that old. The first was adopted in 2005. A second, updated version was approved in 2014, following a two-year rewrite. Doing so again could take another two years.

This comes after the village spent about 18 months in 2018-19 rewriting its comprehensive land-use plan. While that document is long on vision, the development ordinance gives specifics on how new subdivisions and businesses are built.

Given its new comprehensive plan, it’s logical that the village should have regulations that allow the council to execute that vision. But an overhaul sounds like overkill, yet that seems to be where the village is headed.

“Almost every single application that’s wended its way through the planning and zoning board and to council, we’ve all had to look at it and shake our heads and say: ‘well you know, we’ve got a lot of concerns and questions about this, but there’s nothing we can do because it’s not in our PDO,’” said Councilwoman Jane Hogeman.

Threadbare? The document has 10 chapters and six appendices. It covers everything from off-street parking to the process of approving major subdivisions. It’s hundreds of pages of details. It is far from threadbare — and it’s not terribly out of date.

“I’m concerned that we’ve got some that are so far in the queue and then we put in a moratorium and all the work that’s been done to that point is going to be worthless,” said Councilwoman Lydia Boesch.

The village, as popular as it is, faces the potential for more growth in coming years. But the risk of running off quality growth with overregulation is very real. For Exhibit A, just look at Morganton Road in Southern Pines, where Pinehurst Medical and Pinehurst Surgical clinics are building new facilities instead of closer to the hospital in Pinehurst.",Editorial: Regulation Rewrite Feels Like Overkill,www.thepilot.com
580,581,https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/illinois-says-incarcerated-should-get-early-covid-19-vaccine/2421216/,"Cook County Jail emerged as a national COVID-19 hotspot early in the pandemic, with hundreds of correctional officers and incarcerated people testing positive. As the virus continued to spread, incarcerated people repeatedly campaigned for better protections.

Relief could now be in sight. Staff at Cook County Jail will began receiving vaccinations Wednesday, and detained people will soon follow, according to Cook County Health officials.

People incarcerated at Illinois Department of Corrections facilities will begin receiving vaccines in about two weeks as part of Phase 1B of Illinois’ vaccination plan, spokesperson Lindsey Hess told Injustice Watch in an e-mail.

That’s because Illinois is one of just a handful of U.S. states that will prioritize incarcerated people in the next phase of its vaccine rollout. This development represents a victory for advocates and incarcerated people who have argued that prisons and jails are overlooked epicenters of infections.

A December study from the Prison Policy Initiative found that higher concentrations of incarcerated people in U.S. counties were associated with earlier reported cases of COVID-19 and larger increases of confirmed cases outside of prisons and jails from May to August 2020.

“One thing that people really don’t realize is that although we don’t go anywhere, we are around people that come and go from the penitentiary every day,” said James Swansey, who was released from Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, in December. “People on the inside, we only have a certain amount of things that we can do to stay safe.”

This next phase of Illinois’ “equity-centric vaccination approach” is set to begin on Jan. 25, allowing local health departments to start vaccinating essential workers, people experiencing homelessness, and people aged 65 and over, in addition to people detained in state jails and prisons.

Illinois had initially designated incarcerated people as Phase 2 recipients, drawing an outcry from advocates.

In December, more than 60 legal and advocacy organizations sent a letter urging the health department to give incarcerated people early access to vaccination, noting their high risk for infection and death. As of December 2020, the COVID-19 mortality rate in prisons nationwide was twice as high as for the general population, according to the National Commission on Covid-19 and Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan criminal justice group.

The health department quietly moved incarcerated people up in line just before the new year, changes to its vaccine distribution plan show.

“Vaccinating prisoners will save lives in the facilities and in the communities surrounding them,” said Camille Bennett, director of the ACLU of Illinois’ Corrections Reform Project, in a statement Monday. “This is good policy.”

People detained in federal prisons, still designated as Phase 2 recipients in CDC guidelines, could still wait months for a vaccine.

Cook County has not yet received vaccine doses to administer to people detained in jail, but staff is currently working with the Sheriff’s Office to develop a vaccination program, said Caryn Stancik, chief communications officer for Cook County Health, on Tuesday.

When the vaccines arrive, they will be administered to residents within the jail facility over several weeks. If someone is released before they can get the second dose, they will maintain priority status for vaccination, according to Stancik.

Renaldo Hudson spent most of the pandemic in Stateville before his release in December. He described delays to vaccinating incarcerated people as a “security breach” that risks the very people whose health correctional facilities are charged with protecting.

“I was in the Department of Corrections for 37 years, and in all those years, I haven’t seen as many people put in body bags and so much fear within the walls of corrections. The fear among the inmate population, you can cut it with a knife,” Hudson told Injustice Watch.

“The stakes are extremely high for the people that are in prison, and the stakes are high for families, people who are barely making it,” Hudson said. “On a moment’s notice, we have to figure out, ‘how do I now bury my brother, my father because they died of COVID-19 in prison.’”",Illinois Says Incarcerated Should Get Early COVID-19 Vaccine,www.nbcchicago.com

No election has ever been monitored more closely because of fears of foreign and domestic disruptions during a pandemic. Voting rights activists worked hard to inform tens of thousands of Wisconsin voters how to vote safely by absentee ballots through the mail and early in person. Hundreds of volunteers served as polling place monitors and monitored social media for disinformation. Election officials and staff did a great job. The result was the highest voter turnout in a presidential election since 2004 — 72.3% of all eligible voters. But because Joe Biden carried Wisconsin by more than 20,000 votes — a result verified in the statewide canvass and further reinforced by a recount of only ballots in the Democratic strongholds of Dane and Milwaukee counties — some supporters of former President Donald Trump attacked huge swaths of voters here. They filed baseless and unsubstantiated lawsuits in a desperate attempt to disqualify enough ballots to swing the state to Trump. Yet some Republicans in the Legislature still want to make voting more difficult in this state, even though Wisconsin already has one of the most restrictive and extreme voter photo ID laws in the nation. They want to do so despite the absence of any verifiable voter “fraud” during 2020.

Why? Because they didn’t like the fact that Biden won. After creating and repeating their false narrative about Wisconsin’s election results — sowing doubt, skewing reality and creating chaos with their own lies — some Republicans now claim the election system they created beginning in 2011 is “broken” and will require their “fixes.” Republicans in the Legislature recently unveiled a partisan proposal to apportion eight of Wisconsin’s electoral votes by congressional district beginning in 2024. In 2020, Biden won the popular vote in Wisconsin and carried all of Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes. Under the new Republican proposal, electoral votes would be decided by the votes each presidential candidate receives in each congressional district. In 2020, Trump had more votes than Biden in six of the state’s eight gerrymandered congressional districts. So under this GOP plan, Trump would have received six electoral votes to Biden four — even though Biden won the most votes overall. This Republican “fix” would further dilute the voices of voters in Wisconsin in the already flawed Electoral College system of electing presidents. Republicans also may try to restrict the ability of voters to utilize absentee ballots. They may ban the use of safe and secure voter drop boxes and other collection methods. They hope to vastly restrict the definition of “indefinitely confined” voters, and to further limit early in-person voting opportunities. They may even move to eliminate Election Day voter registration, which has been in place in Wisconsin for decades.

All of these methods for casting ballots are used by voters across the political spectrum throughout the state. They have been used by the very legislators who now seek to limit or stop them. This is all part of a consistent and long-term strategy of Republicans in the Legislature to maintain and extend their partisan advantage by making it more difficult to vote for those who tend to vote for Democrats and progressives, such as people of color, residents of Milwaukee and Dane counties, and college and university students.

Gov. Tony Evers says he will veto any such measures and oppose voter suppression. Yet the governor’s opposition to this looming threat to democracy isn’t enough. The citizens of Wisconsin need to rise up and make it clear to every member of the Wisconsin Legislature that they should be expanding voting opportunities and making it easier for more Wisconsinites to be able to participate in elections.

582,583,https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/warren-county/mason/new-hospital-in-mason-to-fill-growing-healthcare-needs-of-southwest-ohio,"In roughly two years, Mercy Health–Cincinnati will open its sixth hospital in southwest Ohio, which officials say will cover an underserved area as other healthcare facility growth has happened throughout the region.

Healthcare options in Butler and Warren counties are expansive, from primary care offices to specialists and limited-hour urgent care facilities. There are also several hospitals with 24-hour emergency departments, most of which are in Butler County.

The most recent hospital built in Butler County was The Christ Hospital Medical Center that opened in January 2018 in Liberty Twp. Mercy Health-Cincinnati plans to build a new $156 million, 60-bed hospital by 2024 at the corner of Kings Island Drive and Kings Mills Road in Mason.

From a statewide perspective, there is growth occurring in the medical care industry, whether that’s a hospital or outpatient clinic, said John Palmer, spokesman for the Ohio Hospital Association. And outpatient procedures are becoming more common, he said.

“We’re just doing more outpatient business than we have in years past,” he said. “Through technology and advancement, there’s been a lot of progress made that’s allowed for more outpatient surgeries, and frankly consumers appreciate that so they can recover at home, or having more expedited care.”

Because the Butler and Warren counties region is one of the more populous in the state, more health care options are needed, Palmer said.

Butler County is the seventh-largest in Ohio with an estimated 2019 population of 383,134, a 4.1 percent increase over 2010. Warren County’s ranks 10th with an estimated 2019 population of 234,602, which is a 10.2 percent increase over 2010.

As Baby Boomers are living longer with an expanding population, Palmer said the hospital association is seeing “hospitals pivoting and responding to those community health needs that are occurring and those population health trends that are occurring.”

“I think as you continue to see those population trends growing and more needs around particular health need ― whether that’s going to be mental health services and other services ― these facility hospital care centers, or medical campuses, are going to help complement that,” Palmer said.

Mercy Health–Cincinnati President Dave Fikse said there are unmet needs in Warren County. There are 150,000 covered residents within the Mercy network, and many are in the Mason area and northeastern part of southwest Ohio, he said.

The Mason Health hospital complex will be more than just a 156,900-square-foot hospital. It will also feature a medical office building.

The hospital will feature an emergency department, Level II cath lab, four operating rooms, two procedure rooms, and room to grow, officials said. The medical office building will have specialist care, such as cardiology, pulmonology, general surgery, gynecology, gastroenterology and vascular services.

Mercy Health officials expect to break ground at the 30-acre site later this year and could bring as many as 220 jobs by 2024 to Warren County. Officials said eventually there could be as many as 275 jobs at the complex.

Mercy’s medical complex will add to the city’s “culture of wellness,” said City Manager Eric Hansen, with the planned hospital being “kind of a linchpin to a lot of work that’s gone on for many years now in building that culture.”

City Manager Rorie Watt talked about that on Action Line. He says they have $500,000 going forward to start the design work for renovations to the ballrooms and a couple of other things. He said it will probably ultimately end up being a $4.6 Million project which was authorized by voters in the October 2019 election.

Half of the sales tax funding is coming from the Mt. Jumbo gym roof project and deferred building maintenance.

Another fund transfer of $300,000 is for the Dimond Park Aquatic Center maintenance fund. A deck treatment to make the deck less slippery and addressing corrosion in some of the lighting is planned, according to Watt.

The Assembly will take up the matter of an unauthorized junked vehicle yard off River Road in the Valley. Watt said this matter has been going on for several years. He figures there are approximately 350 junks. The problem is that it is in a residential neighborhood that does not allow junkyards. Watt said they've been in court pursuing compliance. He said the Assembly will be updated on the process that will start of clean up that property.

The manager is seeking Assembly approval to expend funds for a park in the Lemon Creek area. The playground along with $100,000 came from the Eagle's Edge Neighborhood Association.

The Assembly will listen to two presiding officer reports regarding appeals of Planning Commission decisions. They include the granting of a conditional use permit for transitional housing on Alaway Avenue in the Lemon Creek area for the Tlingit-Haida Central Council.

The other is the granting of a conditional use permit for the arts campus building and plaza that the Sealaska Heritage Institute is seeking to build.

The body will be asked to sign off on the project calling for the resurfacing of Vanderbilt Hill Road from Egan Drive to Glacier Highway that will be done from this spring through fall.

Members will also take up a Planning Commission request that the body funds a traffic study of Calhoun Avenue and the surrounding area following its denial of the project that was proposed.

584,585,https://pamplinmedia.com/pt/9-news/495712-397673-police-say-average-911-response-times-declining,"The Portland Police Bureau announced Sunday, Jan. 24, that it is making progress reducing 911 response time following a spike in delays during months of large summer protests that frequently turned violent.

""While high-priority calls for service took longer to respond to during the summer months, progress has been made in decreasing response time, and other steps are being taken to further address the issue,"" the bureau said in a Jan. 23 news release.

According to the bureau, the monthly average time to respond to a high-priority call for service increased from June and peaked in August, but has been reduced each month since. The bureau reports that average response times have declined from 16.4 minutes in August to 10.4 minutues in December 2020.

The bureau also said officers from other units back will be reassigned to patrol duties Feb. 4 to increase resources to decrease overtime expenditures and assist with calls for service response. This is the soonest these officers can be reassigned under the Portland Police Association contract.

""Responding when our community calls for help is our core function, and it's disheartening when we don't meet expectations,"" said Deputy Chief Chris Davis. ""I'm encouraged that we're seeing improved call response despite unprecedented budget and staffing challenges. That's a testament to the dedication of our patrol officers. We will do everything we can, within the limited resources we have, to meet our community's public safety needs.""

Many officers were pulled off patrol duties over the summer to cover nightly protests that frequently turned violent in downtown and other parts of Portland. That reduced the officers availabe to respond to 911 calls. The number and size of such protests have declined in recent weeks.

According to the bureau, a number of factors drive response times, including, but not limited to: what other calls are happening in the precinct or citywide that are requiring resources; how many officers are available in a geographic region, what the type of call is and its corresponding priority level; how many resources are needed to address the type of call in as safe a manner as possible; the time of day and day of the week; and traffic conditions affecting officer drive time.

In addition, the bureau said, some calls for service are determined to be informational in nature or not criminal matters. Patrol supervisors are trained to balance the call load with available resources and in certain cases can cancel the call. There is a procedure for this, and supervisors are tasked with balancing public expectations, bureau resources, the bureau's mission, values, and goals, and dedication to community policing.

A decision to cancel police response carries with it the obligation to attempt to contact those requesting police services and inform them why there will be no response.

Fronting a press conference in Wellington on Sunday afternoon, Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins and Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the woman had visited cafés, restaurants and tourist spots between Auckland and Whangārei, before reporting feeling unwell, testing positive for the virus, and going into isolation at her home.

As of 7pm Sunday night, the Ministry of Health had confirmed one of these locations; a Bendon outlet shop in Whangārei.

Hipkins said the 56-year-old woman had been isolating at Auckland’s Pullman Hotel after arriving in New Zealand from Europe on December 30, but had passed both her Covid-19 tests before leaving isolation.

 * Covid-19: Six new cases of coronavirus detected at the border



The woman started feeling mild symptoms on January 15, including muscle aches, and began feeling sicker over time. A positive Covid-19 test was returned on Saturday evening.

It is the first community case in New Zealand since November 18 last year and, although the true source of infection awaits further tests results expected on Monday, Bloomfield said officials were working on the assumption the woman caught virus in isolation and had caught one of the more virulent strains.

“We are working on the assumption this is positive case and a more transmissible variant.”

“We need people to be vigilant and get with the programme.”

It comes amid warning from experts that New Zealand needs to impose stricter measures at the border in order to keep out Covid-19 strains that a raging overseas.

Bloomfield confirmed at least 13 guests that were staying at the Pullman at the same time as the woman has tested positive for Covid-19, including some with the more virulent strain.

About 600 people that worked or stayed at the hotel at the same time as the woman are being asked to self-isolate and will be retested.

As of Sunday night, four close contacts had been identified, and were self-isolating, with all 30 places she visited being contacted, and tracing of other possible contacts underway.

However, Hipkins said the woman was travelling alone with her husband, did not attend mass events and had been taking all precautions.

He said he did not want to make any comments about the potential spread or the Government’s possible response, such as further lockdowns, until the necessary information was gathered.

“It's very early days yet,” he said.

However, extra Covid-19 testing capacity in Auckland and Northland had already been set up on Sunday, in anticipation for a surge in people seeking tests.

He reiterated what has been asked of Kiwis – including staying home if feeling unwell and getting a test.

People were asked to continue scanning in to locations through the Covid Tracer app – something the woman was doing herself.

Until 8pm on Sunday, community testing would be available at 20 Winger Crescent in Whangārei.

Information about other testing sites in Northland can be found here and here for Auckland.

On Sunday, the Ministry of Health said there were eight other new cases of Covid-19, all in managed isolation.

Two of the positive cases were from South Africa, two from the United States, one from the United Kingdom, one from the United Arab Emirates, one from Ethiopia and one from India.

On Friday, Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins announced optional saliva testing would be available for border workers in quarantine facilities from Monday.

It is the first time Covid-19 saliva testing has been offered by the Government.

This new precautionary measure is in response to higher rates of infection overseas and the more transmissible variants of Covid-19.

The saliva tests would be offered on a voluntary basis, and would not replace nasal swabs, Hipkins said.

590,591,https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/teens-tutor-others-online-to-fill-need-during-the-pandemic/5743761.html,"Charvi Goyal is a high school student from Dallas, Texas who helps out other classmates by tutoring them between classes. A tutor is someone who teaches one person or a very small group of students.

When Goyal’s high school moved online last spring because of the coronavirus crisis, she decided to also take her teaching online.

The 17-year-old junior and three of her fellow students created TutorScope, a service that offers free tutoring services to other children, including younger ones.

TutorScope started with a small number of tutors who helped young people in their city. But it has grown into a group of 22 tutors from Texas, Arizona, and Ohio. They have helped more than 300 students, some from as far away as South Korea.

Goyal said she expected that schools would go online. She also believed online classes would face some problems. For example, she felt that communication between students – and between students and teachers – would be weakened.

TutorScope aims to give the one-on-one help that teachers have traditionally given while walking around their classrooms. But now, many teachers cannot provide that one-on-one support because they lack time or have issues with technology.

Sarah Newman said her children, 7-year-old twins, have had helpful TutorScope experiences. The service has freed up her and her 17-year-old son to pay attention to their work. “With these tutors, I realize they have time,” she said. “I think they are very patient with these younger kids, which I do not even have as a mother. I have patience in other things, (but) I don’t have patience” for teaching. TutorScope is not the first nonprofit to give online tutoring.

People around the world have come up with ways to educate children during the coronavirus crisis, from a teacher in Nigeria who grades homework to a so-called sidewalk school in Mexico.

What makes the TutorScope effort special is the connection between the teenage volunteers and the other students they are helping.

The group accepts donations from adults but limits volunteers to students.

Now in their third semester, TutorScope has received nonprofit status from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS.

The group has also gotten a software company to give them free use of a system to set up tutor meetings. Sixteen-year-old Jessica Ding runs the website with student Angelina Ehara, who works on public communication and social media. Another student, Kaustubh Sonawane, runs the signup process.

In addition to helping others, the tutors also get experience themselves that will look great on a college or job application. The service can also help them decide whether they want to teach full-time or run a business or an NGO someday.

New tutors get limited training from recordings. Goyal’s main hope from possible volunteers is that they truly want to help the kids that they tutor.

Although the pandemic has forced many students to look inward, Goyal said that working with others on a big project has permitted her to look outward.

“My confidence level has increased,” Goyal said. She added that she has made friends with other students from her school. She said one of the best things about running a growing nonprofit is that it “does help with the boredom” of being stuck at home.

Speaking on the occasion of the 18th Convocation of Tezpur University on Friday, Sonowal said, ""On the fierce competition in the present-day society the students must have been awakened to the realities of intense competition and acquired capacity during their stay in the university to take advantage of competitive environment prevalent outside.""

Sonowal asked them to use this capacity to create wealth and welfare for the society and for the organizations they belong to. He also said that students should consider it to be their bounded duty to strive for welfare of society, for reducing disparity therein and to empower those who are disadvantaged.

Sonowal said that the lockdowns did not only facilitated measures in arresting the virus spread to a considerable extent, it also gave the country much needed time to gear up its health infrastructure facilities, medical equipment producing trained manpower which have helped the country in taking aggressive measures to trace, test, isolate, treat and prevent the spread of cornavirus.

Sonowal said that the north-eastern region at this moment is experiencing rapid progress due to unparalleled political will of the Prime Minister. With significant boost to connectivity and speedy industrialization, the region is fast emerging as the nerve-centre of India's economic activity.

He further said that the ""Act East Policy"" enunciated by the Prime Minister has opened up new doors of opportunities in communication, transportation, trade and business, tourism, cultural exchange, sports, information technology, agriculture etc., to link the Northeast with ASEAN and BBN countries. Likewise, to promote industrialization, the State government has also come up with new policy on tax incentives for setting up industries and tourism units, IT policy, biotech policy, start-up policy, sugar policy, solar energy policy, Assam Industrial Investment Policy etc.

Sonowal urged the graduates of Tezpur University with their innovative ideas, knowledge and skill to join the start-up movement to exploit the market potential of Assam, from which service can be provided to 800 million population spreading across the North Eastern States of India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and the ASEAN countries, a press release said.

The effort to test more incoming students aims to better monitor levels of COVID-19 transmission to prevent the spread from getting out of hand on campus as it did in August.

One week into the fall semester, UNC shut down all in-person classes for undergraduates and urged students to leave their residence halls and return home. North Carolina State University and East Carolina University followed suit shortly thereafter.

UNC said it has performed 13,500 tests in three testing centers and seven pop-up sites at residence halls since Jan. 11.

Since the start of the new calendar year, 262 students and 83 employees have tested positive for the virus. About one-third of the cases were reported through the campus testing initiative.

UNC, which kicked off the semester Tuesday with virtual learning, decided earlier this month that it would delay in-person classes by three weeks due to increased spread of the virus throughout North Carolina and the nation.

The News International reported that an advisory has been issued by the UN Security Management System (UNSMS) which states: ""Due to an ongoing investigation of the CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] Pakistan...due to dubious licenses caution is advised on the use of Pakistan-registered air operators.""

According to the Pakistan daily, the UN advisory has been recommended to agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), UN High Commission for Refugees, UN Development Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and many others.

In the light of this development, that UN officials working in the country can not travel by any Pakistan-registered airline, even within Pakistan.

According to The News International, UN advisory said that the air operator information is the result of a new automated system, which is linked with the revised global air travel safety policy.

Back in December last year, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had extended a ban on Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) for three months, despite the Pakistani officials' expectations that the ban would be lifted.

The EASA had informed that the PIA that the ban would only be lifted after a safety audit of the Civil Aviation Authority, Dawn reported. The EASA had in July 2019 suspended the authorisation for PIA to operate flights in the EU member states due to safety concerns.

The suspension had come after it was revealed that the credentials of hundreds of Pakistani pilots were ""dubious"".

These tests look for antibodies, which are specific proteins that fight off infections, to determine if someone has already been infected. At the same time, COVID-19 cases recently dipped from one week to the next. And the percentage of positive diagnostic tests also fell for two consecutive weeks. Both metrics, however, still remain at high levels. At face value, this is encouraging news. It suggests that relatively more people have been recovering from the virus while fewer people contracted it. “I think that that’s a good sign,” said Dr. Francisco Garcia, Pima County’s chief medical officer. “And I’m hoping that we continue in that vein. At the same time that we are vaccinating.” Experts like Garcia, however, are cautious when interpreting the rate of positive serology tests. “It’s probably accurate in the sense that ... more Arizonans have been infected and recovered. I think that’s an obvious statement that serology doesn’t necessarily need to help us answer,” said Dr. Joe Gerald, an associate professor with the University of Arizona’s College of Public Health. What experts really want to know is the percentage of Arizonans who are immune to COVID-19 and won’t become infected again, whether they achieved immunity from a vaccine or by recovering from an infection. This tally would help them know when the state is approaching herd immunity.

The R0 value, which is pronounced “R-naught,” suggests that herd immunity could be reached when 60-65% of people are immune, Gerald said. Garcia’s target is a little higher, coming in at 75%. The R0 value is the average number of people an infected person infects if no one is immune. For COVID-19, that number is about 2.5, Gerald said. We are nowhere near such widespread herd immunity that COVID-19 stops spreading, Gerald said. But at half the percentage needed to reach herd immunity, we could start to see the virus spread at a slower pace, he said. As more people become immune, each infected person starts to run into more people he or she can’t infect. Theoretically, serology tests could help us count how many people are immune by detecting antibodies. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are still researching how much protection antibodies grant patients from getting infected again, but reinfections remain rare. At this point, however, serology testing can’t effectively do the job, Gerald said. “The scale of serology testing is just really, really tiny compared to the size of Arizona,” he said. This leads to a huge risk of sampling bias, he said. Those showing up to get tested aren’t a good representation of the population as a whole. People get tested for specific reasons. Many think they have been infected or know they have, which skews the rate of positive test results. Statewide, the rate of positive serology tests spiked from a recent low of 9% in the last week of October to 38% in the second week of January, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services’ chart of test results, as of Friday. Countywide, it rose from 6% to 31% over the same period.

Gerald estimates that at most 30% of all Arizonans have natural immunity after having contracted the virus. When you add that number to the less than 1% of people who have been fully vaccinated statewide, he said, we’re getting closer to half of what we need to reach herd immunity. By other estimates, the state has even fewer people who are naturally immune. Tim Lant, a mathematical epidemiologist at Arizona State University, said most estimates are between 20% to 25% have natural immunity. In Pima County, 63,084 total vaccine doses have been administered, according to the ADHS, as of Friday. Statewide, a total of 380,764 vaccine doses have been administered. Many who have received the vaccine have not received the full two doses. That combination of natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity may be enough to tap the breaks on viral spread and level out cases, Gerald said. But he estimates that 75% of the population won’t be immune until the summer. “So we actually are beginning to get in the neighborhood where natural immunity could be slowing the cases down,” he said. “How confident am I in that? Not confident enough to say that’s definitely why cases turned down. But I think it is beginning to be a plausible reason why case counts may not go much higher than they are now.” Across the state, week-to-week cases decreased by 25% in the second week of January, dropping to 48,422, while diagnostic tests fell by 13%. The percentage of positive diagnostic tests also decreased from 22% to 20%.

Countywide, week-to-week cases decreased by 22% to 6,841 in the second week of January, while diagnostic tests fell by 12%. And the percentage of positive diagnostic tests fell from 22% to 19%. While natural immunity may play a role in slowing the virus, continuing infections will lead to even more deaths and hospitalizations. And hospitals don’t have much more room to help people recover. Only 8% of inpatient beds and 9% of ICU beds were available on Thursday across Arizona, according to ADHS’s chart of hospital bed usage and availability, as of Friday. Statewide bed capacity hasn’t changed much in the past week. New coronavirus hospitalizations increased statewide by 9% to 3,762 in the first week of January, which broke yet another record. In Pima County, coronavirus hospitalizations dipped by 1% to 405, according to data published on Wednesday from the Pima County Health Department. The Star typically waits two weeks to interpret COVID-19 death and hospitalization data to account for data reporting delays. But sometimes the data is delayed even longer, and these numbers could increase even more as more data are potentially backfilled. Over the past week, for example, about 260 more statewide hospitalizations were reported for the first week of January. Across the state, COVID-19 deaths rose by 2% to 840 in the first week of January, setting yet another record, according to the ADHS’s chart of deaths by date. In Pima County, 98 people died from COVID-19 in the first week of January, which was down 22% from the week before, according to the data published by the county’s Health Department.","Natural immunity might be slowing COVID-19, but Arizona is far from herd immunity",tucson.com

Downing Street said the Prime Minister congratulated Mr Biden on his inauguration, and warmly welcomed his decision to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change and the World Health Organisation – both abandoned by Donald Trump.

Following the call, Mr Johnson tweeted: “Great to speak to President Joe Biden this evening.

“I look forward to deepening the long-standing alliance between our two countries as we drive a green and sustainable recovery from Covid19.”

A No 10 spokesman said they had also discussed the potential benefits of a free trade deal, with the Prime Minister reiterating his intention to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible.

“The Prime Minister praised President Biden’s early action on tackling climate change and commitment to reach net zero by 2050,” the spokesman said.

“Building on the UK and US’ long history of cooperation in security and defence, the leaders re-committed to the NATO alliance and our shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy.

“The leaders looked forward to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow, and to working together through the G7, G20 and Cop26 this year.”

It is reported that Mr Johnson is the first European leader to have spoken to the new president, after he had calls on Friday with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

There will be some relief in Downing Street at the early call amid concerns about the way Mr Johnson’s perceived closeness to Mr Trump would be seen by the new administration.

The Prime Minister is regarded with deep suspicion by some senior Democrats around Mr Biden who – unlike the former president – was no fan of Brexit.

Many were offended by his sideswipe at the “part-Kenyan” Barack Obama during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, while Mr Biden once described him as a “physical and emotional clone” of Mr Trump.

Following the inauguration, No 10 sought to play down Mr Biden’s decision to remove a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office – even though Mr Johnson had criticised Mr Obama when he did the same thing.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The Oval Office is the president’s private office and it’s up to the president to decorate it as he wishes.

“We’re in no doubt of the importance that President Biden places on the UK and US relationship and the Prime Minister looks forward to having a close relationship with him.”",Boris Johnson has first call with new US president Joe Biden,www.kentonline.co.uk

The cause was complications of the West Nile virus, according to Chris Roe, her manager. 

 

From 1993 to 1998, Furlan starred in Babylon 5, a space opera that followed the relationships, politics, interspecies tensions and galactic conflicts aboard a United Nations-type space station in the mid-23rd century. She played Ambassador Delenn, representing the Minbari alien race on the space station. 

 

Delenn is a wonderful creation, a woman who must be a leader and must be strong, but who is also full of emotion and secrets, Furlan said in 1997. 

 

Furlan twice won a Sci-Fi Universe Award for best supporting actress for her work on the show, which also starred Bruce Boxleitner and Stephen Furst. She appeared in all 111 episodes and in two Babylon 5 TV movies. 

 

In 2004, she began playing the scientist Danielle Rousseau on the popular ABC drama Lost, about a group of survivors stranded on a remote mysterious island after the crash of their jetliner. She played her character, known as the Frenchwoman, through the shows final season, in 2010.

Mira Furlan was born on Sept. 7, 1955, in Zagreb, Croatia, where she was a leading actress in theater, film and TV and was part of the Croatian National Theater. A profile once described her as the Balkan equivalent of Meryl Streep. 

 

Amid civil war in her homeland, she emigrated in 1991 to New York City with her husband, Goran Gajic, a writer and director. She lived and acted in the city until moving to Los Angeles for Babylon 5. In addition to her husband, she is survived by their son, Marko Lav Gajic. 

 

Her other acting credits include appearances on NCIS, Law and Order: LA and more than 25 films. She most recently appeared in another science fiction series, Space Command, playing a former archaeologist. 

 

At the time of her death, Furlan was working on her autobiography. 

 

An excerpt released by her manager and posted on her website invoked space to describe her sense of peace as she battled illness. 

 

I look at the stars, she wrote. Its a clear night and the Milky Way seems so near. Thats where Ill be going soon.

600,601,https://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/national/19034623.museum-used-set-tv-drama-peaky-blinders-open-vaccination-centre/,"The Black Country Living Museum, made famous as a set for hit TV drama Peaky Blinders, is to open as a vaccination centre on Monday.

The Victorian-era heritage site, which has previously been used as a backdrop for the BBC show, will open its doors next week as one of the latest locations to help deliver the Government’s national Covid-19 vaccination rollout.

The opening, announced on Friday by NHS Black Country and West Birmingham clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), has been described as a “game-changer” for Dudley and the surrounding area.

Latest figures from NHS England showed 97,310 jabs had been administered in the area by Thursday, since the national rollout began.

That places it second out of all Midlands areas in administering jabs, behind Birmingham and Solihull, where 98,536 total doses had been given.

The well-known landmark will be offering invite-only vaccines, with patients receiving letters to attend appointments, prioritising jabs for people most at risk of complications from Covid-19.

People are being urged not to call or contact the museum directly, but wait to be written to by the NHS.

The museum centre will complement existing GP-led vaccination services which are already up and running locally.

Sally Roberts, Black Country and West Birmingham CCGs chief nurse, said: “Across the Black Country and West Birmingham, a great many people are working hard to roll out vaccinations, starting with those most at risk.

“Our progress to date has been incredible and I am delighted that our first vaccination centre, which will be capable of delivering thousands more vaccines each week, is going live.”

She urged people in receipt of a time slot to arrive promptly, while adding “there is no need to arrive for your vaccine earlier than your appointment time as this may result in you and others waiting longer than necessary”.

Andrew Lovett, museum chief executive, said the people who get the jab were helping the NHS “in the most important public health initiative it has ever undertaken”.

He added: “By hosting the vaccine centre at the museum, we’re able to support the NHS in providing immunisation for the local community.”

Councillor Nicolas Barlow, Dudley Council’s elected health chief, said: “This is fantastic news – a real game-changer in our fight across the borough against the coronavirus.

“Having the Black Country Living Museum on board as a vaccination centre will greatly increase the amount of jabs we can deliver, and the speed at which we can administer them.

“It will make people safer from this deadly virus more quickly.”

He urged people to have the vaccine if offered, and called on everyone to continue to follow public health and social distancing rules.

“We have always said we will beat this, and we are getting closer to that day,” he said.

“But we still need to remain vigilant.”",Museum used as set for TV drama Peaky Blinders to open as vaccination centre,www.winsfordguardian.co.uk
601,602,https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/battle-over-loneliest-elephant-longleat-4921298,"A battle is taking places between activists and Longleat over the retirement plans of 'Britain's loneliest elephant'.

Activists say she is desperate for company, while staff at the Wiltshire safari park insist she should not be moved.

Anne, Britain's last circus elephant, made headlines in 2011 when video footage revealed her struggles.

The Asian elephant was languished in chains, beaten and forced to perform tricks for more than 50 years.

She was rescued shortly after from The Bobby Roberts' Super Circus' winter quarters in Polebrook, Northamptonshire, reports the Mirror.

Looking for today's top stories in one place? Sign up for our newsletter here.

She now resides in a heated £1.2m home at Longleat that was specially built for her, where she is free to move in and out of around the clock.

But activists say they want Anne, to retire to a specially designed sanctuary with the company of other elephants in the south of France.

The warmer climate there would help the arthritis of Anne, who is believed to be aged around 61 years old and has not seen another elephant in at least 19 years.

Action for Elephants UK and Animal Defenders International, who obtained footage of her at the circus, say a place is waiting for her at Elephant Haven in Limousin, France, which they say has also offered to fund the transportation.

They also claim the conditions at Longleat are inadequate for an animal that needs company, more sunlight and environmental stimulation.

Even Anne’s age is disputed. Some believe she is nearly 70 now, but Action for Elephants say she is more likely to be 61.

Their campaign has been backed by actress Joanna Lumley. She said: “It’s unnatural and cruel for a highly intelligent, social female elephant to be confined alone, and Anne has been on her own for 19 years.

“Listless and dejected, she has nothing to enrich or stimulate her – her life is one of uninterrupted monotony.

“It’s time now for Longleat to do the right thing and release her to sanctuary, where she will have all her needs met and can finally live among other elephants, as nature intended.”

More than 40,000 people have now signed petitions in favour of her release.

Officials at Longleat believe the stress of a move abroad would be too risky for Anne because of her age as well as her physical and mental health.

They also say that introducing her to younger elephants after all this time would leave her in danger of being bullied.

A spokesman said: “We genuinely understand and sympathise with the strongly held views some people have that, despite all of Anne’s very specific issues, she would benefit from the company of other elephants.

“Elephants are social animals, in the wild they live in extended family groups. This is the life Anne should have had. However, and very sadly, this is unfortunately not the case.

“She is now a very, elderly lady, with limited mobility and serious, underlying physical and mental health issues, who has undergone systematic abuse over decades and been subjected to bullying; both by humans and other elephants.

“Uprooting her from familiar surroundings and people she has learnt to trust over more than a “decade, and transporting her to a new, unknown location with the prospect of being left in the company of other elephants she does not know, in the hope it will somehow markedly improve her living conditions would appear to be an extremely high risk strategy.”

Longleat also said the French sanctuary has not been in touch with them directly and as of yet do not have any elephants. They also said that Anne is regularly assessed by independent experts and had a full annual check-up but declined to reveal their identities for fear of harassment.

Anne was born in Sri Lanka and came to the UK aged five to work in circuses. Owner Bobby Roberts, 69, was found guilty in 2012 of three counts of causing unnecessary suffering and of failing to prevent a groom from repeatedly beating Anne.",Battle over 'loneliest elephant' at Longleat after circus abuse,www.bristolpost.co.uk

The Scottish Finance Secretary, who will present her plan to MSPs on Thursday, has been at loggerheads with her Treasury counterparts over how funds should be controlled as Nationalist ministers hold down their position on Scottish independence.

But in pre-budget consultations, the Scottish Finance Secretary said sectors have stressed the need for targeted support, which she claims will be delivered. However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the SNP led Scottish Government to acknowledge the support the UK Government was providing during the coronavirus pandemic. Questions have also been raised by the Scottish Conservatives as to whether millions of pounds of Brexit funds had been spent or whether the SNP led administration was stashing away cash. Maurice Golden MSP, the party's economy spokesperson, claimed the SNP was “not lifting a finger” over spending. At the same time, Treasury figures revealed Scottish firms had benefited from more than £3.4billion of UK Government-backed loans to protect and support jobs across the country.

They reveal 86,000 loans have supported businesses across all sectors, protecting UK jobs. Dividing the total spent by the number of loans reveals an average of £39,534 “Union boost” has been given to Scottish business, the data shows. Alongside this, Tory UK ministers also say they have protected 930,000 jobs through the furlough job-retention scheme and provided £8.6billion in Barnet consequentials to the SNP led administration in Edinburgh. Mr Sunak said: “Throughout this crisis, we have provided more than £280billion of support to protect jobs and livelihoods up and down the country. ""We are committed to continuing to ensure jobs are protected and opportunity is created.” READ MORE: Ian Blackford admits SNP have one final shot at independence dream

Alister Jack, Secretary of State for Scotland, added: “Throughout the pandemic, the UK Government has taken quick and unprecedented action to protect jobs and support businesses in Scotland. “Today’s figures speak for themselves, over 90,000 businesses across Scotland have benefitted from £3.4billion in UK-Government backed loans providing a vital lifeline and certainty to plan for the months ahead. “As we continue to see throughout this pandemic, the strength of the Union and support offered by the UK Treasury has never been more important.” Angry business owners also claim they haven’t received support from the Scottish Government. One Scottish business owner claimed in a Scottish business group: “My business is in its second lockdown and I am qualifying for no money apart from loans. DON'T MISS:

“She [Nicola Sturgeon] is stashing that money for her independence push.” Amjid Bashir, who owns Newsbox on Glasgow’s Queen Street, said he has been excluded from all financial grants despite being classed as an “essential business”. He said: “I have applied for so many grants but we’ve been told that because we are deemed as an essential business, we aren’t eligible to receive them.” Pamela Nash, chief executive of campaign group Scotland in Union stressed the importance of the UK Government helping to add money to the Scottish budget. The former Labour MP said: “All this at a time when we need our political leaders to be completely focussed on rebuilding our country. It will take time; that is not in doubt.

“And while there has been an unprecedented level of support for businesses, with more than £8billion added to the Scottish budget from the UK government to assist the COVID-19 response, jobs and livelihoods will still be at risk for years to comes. “It’s clear what 2021 must be about: recovery. “That must be the focus of both the coming Scottish election campaign and the parliamentary term which follows.” However, in a hit back at Westminster, Ms Forbes said the UK Budget delay until March by the Chancellor had caused ""significant difficulties"" in the process north of the border. Ms Forbes also said there would not be a public-sector pay freeze similar to that announced by the UK Government and staff would be offered a settlement that was ""fair and affordable"" in Thursday’s budget.",SNP sparks furious row as Sturgeon accused of 'stashing away' cash for independence drive,www.express.co.uk

The actor, 60, is known for starring in Shakespeare plays including Much Ado About Nothing and as Gilderoy Lockhard in the Harry Potter films.

It will cover the period of the coronavirus pandemic, and the way scientists, healthcare professionals, public health advisors, and the government have responded to the issue.

Michael Winterbottom has co-written the series with Kieron Quirke, and he will direct all of the five episodes, due for release in Autumn 2022.

The Mirror has contacted a representative for Sky for comment.

Michael said: ""The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic will be remembered forever. The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic will be remembered forever

606,607,https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium.MAGAZINE-the-military-radio-station-is-too-political-what-about-the-army-itself-1.9475553,"It was my home, for four years: The shabby building on Yehuda Hayamit Street in Jaffa. IDF Radio, all the time; my finest years, my sweet memories, between the omelette at Davidovich’s and the legendary sergeant major Badosa. Even back then they were threatening to close the station, which had just then started broadcasting 24 hours a day.

It is doubtful whether they will ever do it. But the threat this is time is especially hypocritical and self-righteous. This is how Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who says he wants to take the station out of the IDF’s hands, at the request of Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi, phrased it:

“Soldiers in uniform will not be involved in politics in any position, it is completely unacceptable, it violates the values of the IDF.” Once again the “IDF’s values.”

It is true there are not many armies in the world that are as political as the IDF, and there are not a lot of soldiers in uniform whose duties are mostly to carry out political objectives. An occupying army is a political army by definition, none are more political.

An army whose soldiers conduct political arrests every night is a political army. An army whose soldiers defend thugs and land thieves, and abuse innocent residents just because of their nationality, is the mother of all political armies.

An army whose prosecutors and judges are enlisted in the effort to carry out dark political goals, is a political army. And now the defense minister and chief of staff are worried that soldiers in uniform should not be involved in politics. What a joke.

This is once again the well-known Israeli syndrome of dealing with the marginal in order to distract attention from the main issue.
• None A response to Israeli violence: Dozens of Palestinians arrested in one night
• None Settlers are taking their anger out on Palestinians – as Israeli troops watch

Gantz and Kochavi are shocked that the military radio station has become political. Its purity of arms has been polluted. A station that was in essence the mothers’ voice, a school for the establishment, where the resemblance between it and real journalism was like that between the IDF Orchestra and music, or between the military prosecution and justice.

A station that represented so well the frightening pull to the right in Israeli society, and caused it, too, to a great extent; where the political debate is always between the moderate right and the extreme right, has suddenly become too political for Gantz and Kochavi.

Radio commentator Yaakov Bardugo desecrated its purity, as well as the purity of the soldiers in uniform. It is fine when soldiers shoot demonstrators and defend criminals, and that’s not political. Only Bardugo is political. What hypocrisy.

IDF Radio has corrupted the media for years. Before the universities had media departments – political science was a discipline and journalism was not – and before colleges existed, the schools were IDF Radio and magazine Haolam Hazeh. The latter was the good one.

IDF Radio introduced the deceptive value of the holy balance in discourse, and educated generations of journalism cadets that it was okay that the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit, a propaganda organization, approves every report on the IDF before it can be broadcast.

Even when we wanted to interview a Knesset member, we were required to get approval in advance from the IDF spokesperson. There were names, primarily from the radical left, who we were forbidden to interview. What was more serious was that we thought that was fine.

IDF Radio was also a school for wittiness, another evil that turned into the main point. Generations of respected journalists came off of this production line, with the added embellishment of the end of youth. IDF Radio was the 8200 unit of today, the elite unit for conformists. Most of its graduates were the middle of the middle of enlisted Israeli journalism.

Bardugo is of course an inarticulate commentator of political messages. Listening to him reminds one of listening to the Voice of Thunder from Cairo. A cult.

I like to listen to him, like a cult. His place is not in a military radio station, just like the place of all the rest of them is not on a military radio station. In fact, there really is no such thing as a military station. And it cannot be allowed to exist, either.

The pretense that the Israeli military should be involved in education, culture, journalism and lately even health should have disappeared from the face of the earth a long time ago. The army is here to be an army. Israel needs to overcome its pretensions and lies. Should IDF Radio be shut down? Yes, why not, but the IDF has a number of much more urgent and important missions – such as becoming a nonpolitical army.",The military radio station is too political?

608,609,https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/young-female-somali-lawmaker-fights-corruption-/5743821.html,"Amina Mohamed Abdi was just 24 years old when she was first elected to Somalia’s parliament in 2012. She defeated two other candidates to win a seat saved specifically for women.

But to reach her political goal, Abdi had to go against the wishes of leaders in her Hawiye clan. Some had urged her not to run for office.

“I was asked ‘you want to be a prostitute? How can a woman represent a clan?’” she told Reuters. Abdi dismissed the comments and kept her plans. She says she thought it was important to run because a clan is not only made up of men.

Four years later, she won an open seat in Hiran, an area north of the capital Mogadishu.

Abdi is now 32 years old and is an active critic of her government. She will seek a third term in an upcoming election. She is the only woman among six politicians competing for the same seat. Abdi is a member of the opposition’s Union and Peace for Development party. She is one of 81 women lawmakers in the 275-seat legislature.

Somalia is a country with a long history of war and fighting. Abdi grew up during a violent civil war that started in the early 1990s. It is estimated that around 300,000 people died of hunger and disease as a result of the fighting.

Growing up in this environment made Abdi want to enter politics to help rebuild her country. As an eight-year-old, she remembers returning from school in Mogadishu to find her house empty and her family gone after fighting broke out. “Everywhere there were gunshots and mortar shells were landing,” she said.

Abdi later lived with her uncle, who is also in parliament, and he inspired her further to work toward her goal.

“I was ... brought up ... in a country when there was no government,” she said. “It is necessary for our children to have a government in order to get the basic rights: security, clean water, and quality education.”

Abdi has expressed those wishes during emotional speeches to parliament that have spread throughout the country. She often accuses the government of corruption and says this makes it unable to protect the country’s 15 million people. The government denies the accusations.

Canab Hussein is a Mogadishu store owner and mother of six. She told Reuters, “Lawmaker Amina is not from my state but I love her.”

“I learnt (about her) over the radio and on Facebook and YouTube. She is a role model, a smart female politician. She bravely speaks the truth,” Hussein said.

The parliamentary elections were set to take place in December but have repeatedly been delayed. The opposition has accused President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed of cheating by putting his allies on an electoral board.

The election delay led to protests in Mogadishu and the opposition has threatened to boycott the upcoming voting.

Winners of the legislative elections will choose Somalia’s next president. President Mohamed is seeking a second term. That vote is planned for February 8, but it is almost sure to be delayed.

Health officials are responding to a new case of coronavirus in the community in Northland.

The case involves a woman who was released from an MIQ facility - Auckland's Pullman hotel - on January 13. She used the Covid tracer app and about 30 locations have been identified where she visited after being released.

The list of locations is yet to be released but stretch from Mangawhai to Dargaville and Helensville in southern Northland. The woman lives just south of Whangarei.

Arrivals get tested on about the 12th day of a 14-day stay in managed isolation and are able to leave if the test is negative.

But it is possible the person was infected in the facility after her last test and was incubating Covid when she left.

Hipkins and director general of health Ashley Bloomfield will give more details at a press conference at the Beehive at 4pm today.

The last case of community transmission in New Zealand was on November 18.

Covid-19 modeller Professor Michael Plank said it was possible the virus was passed from one infected person to another in a managed isolation facility.

""One of the risks we've always been aware of is someone arrives with the virus, but then they pass it on to someone else in quarantine, perhaps near the end of their stay,"" said Plank, of the University of Canterbury and Te Punaha Matatini.

""That's one possible way the virus can leak out. I'm not saying that's what happened in this case, but it's a possibility, because it would be unlikely for someone to be incubating the virus for that length of time.""

University of Auckland Professor of Medicine Des Gorman said health experts would be scrambling to test the person's contacts.

""What's required now is to not only test the people who have been in direct contact like family members and so on - but also to start encouraging people to turn up and be tested en masse so that there can be some reassurance that there aren't any other cases in the community.""

Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said there was not yet any evidence of actual community ""transmission"" in Northland. ""It's still most likely this is a border case.""

At today's 1pm Covid update, the Ministry of Health announced there had been eight new Covid cases in managed isolation since Friday.

The cases came from South Africa (2), the UK, United Arab Emirates, the US (2), Ethiopia and India. Four travelled via UAE and Malaysia.

One previously reported case had recovered, the ministry said.

Tests have now detected 36 people arriving in New Zealand with highly contagious strains of the virus since they emerged late last year: 29 with the UK variant and seven with the South African variant.

In the past fortnight, 17 more people were in quarantine facilities infected with the variants.

Whole genome sequencing had identified 11 samples of B.1.1.7 (known as the UK variant) and six samples of B.1.3.5.1 (known as the South Africa variant).

The ministry warned the strains would continue to show up in managed isolation facilities across New Zealand.

The Government has introduced pre-flight testing from most countries to reduce the number of people arriving at the border with Covid-19. Covid tests are given to people on the day of arrival, as well as day three and day 12.

There are currently 79 active cases in quarantine and the total number of confirmed cases is 1927.

The total number of tests processed by laboratories to date is 1,487,234.

The seven-day rolling average up to yesterday is 3335 tests processed.

613,614,https://island.lk/conspiracy-theorists-political-blackguards-and-patience/,"The present-day sky is crowded. Airways crisscross above continents and oceans and are severely congested with all kinds of aeroplanes carrying passengers and cargo. Then someone crashes, people die, and we say, “What a shame!” The manufacturers start defending their aeroplane, the insurance companies look for loopholes to creep through and save their bacon. Of course, there is always the ever-present ‘pilot error’ verdict to take the final blame. That is what happens in air crashes and crash causes. The dying or the surviving is seldom man-made. It is all done upstairs and has little to do with what we deduce from what we know or hear. I have seen enough of the sky and what happens in it to figure that out.

On 7 August 1997, a Fine Air DC-8-61F took off from Miami International on a direct flight to Santo Domingo. It was a cargo flight, two pilots and a Flight Engineer plus a security officer were the only occupants. The DC-8 rolled off on Runway 27 Right and eased into the azure blue Florida sky.

That’s when the trouble started. The first officer was flying, and he could not control the pitch attitude of the aeroplane, and the nose kept creeping up. The speed started bleeding off and the big cargo jet stalled and crashed 3000 ft beyond the end of the runway. It instantly killed the four people on board and also a luckless motorist who was passing on the road beyond the airfield.

The investigation proved the DC-8 was loaded incorrectly by the cargo people and the trim settings shown were wrong.

The load sheet is given to the Captain a few minutes before the doors are closed. It shows how the aeroplane is loaded and how the centre of gravity is calculated by the load master who decides how the payload should be distributed. If he makes a mistake, and the Captain fails to notice it, no one would know that till the aeroplane rotates and the pitch attitude misbehaves. At times it could become almost impossible to fly the aeroplane.

That’s one down and two to go of the three stories.

The Ethiopian 707 cargo aeroplane was loaded and ready for takeoff in Fiumicino Airport in Rome on 19th November 1977. It was a two-sector flight, first to Asmara and then to Addis Ababa, carrying a consignment of tyres. There were five onboard, the two pilots and the Flight Engineer and two security officers.

The aeroplane was almost fully loaded with heavy cargo plus 11,000 gallons of fuel. The Captain checked the load sheet and calculated the take-off power needed and set the stabilizer trim according to the units that were displayed in the load sheet.

The 707 rolled out of Fiumicino and took off. It is not clear what happened; the theories are multiple. The 707 could not be controlled in the pitching and nosedived to a scrub bush jungle on the extended centerline of the runway.

All five people in the aircraft died. The 11,000 gallons of fuel burned the fuselage to cinders. Maybe the calculated trim was wrong or maybe the loading of the cargo was not according to centre of gravity limits. Some even said the cargo pallets may have shifted. Either way, the five people who died lost their lives in vain, perhaps due to a loading mistake.

And now I come to the third aeroplane, the one that got away.

No, this I did not take from any record book; nor is it a trumped-up story from a third or fourth party. This is straight from the horse’s mouth. It was the surviving pilot who laid bare all the facts of this incredible story. Captain Jaya Seneviratne is no more, he passed away some years ago. First Officer Nihal Jayawickrema flew almost every jet aeroplane that served Sri Lanka and retired after being the Director of Flight Operations in the national carrier. I write this in honour of these two pilots. Let the truth be on record, stated as it happened so that such professional pinnacles are remembered and told and re-told for future generations.

The year was 1971. The JVP had taken up arms to fight the ruling coalition of the Sirimavo Bandaranaike government. At the start the armed forces were ill-prepared to contain the onslaught of the youth uprising. The pendulum swung both ways and hundreds from the two sides died in vain. I better stop that sad story now before I forget my purpose and blast away at things that are best left unsaid.

Ammunition and soldiers had to be moved to fight the JVP. Road transport was difficult due to guerilla-type ambushers. The safest was by air, load an old DC-3 and fly wherever you wanted. Such was the plan when Capt. Seneviratne and F/O Jayawickrema got onboard to fly from Ratmalana to Vavuniya. They had to carry some soldiers and a lot of ammunition boxes that weighed like concrete blocks. Of course, there were no cabin crew, and strangely more passengers than seats, more like military musical chairs. The plane had to fly to Vavuniya, unload soldiers and ammo and return empty to Ratmalana. Of course, whoever ordered the flight had thrown away the rule book. There was no LOAD SHEET. This was an emergency; nobody knew how much the payload weighed and where the trim sheet centre of gravity was. The Captain was a grizzly old school veteran, and the F/O was a bright young spark, and between them they were more than capable of flying to Vavuniya and back. Passengers seated and standing, limitlessly over-loading, and with enough ammunition to make it a flying bomb if any emergency occurred, somebody sure had vapourised the rule book. Had to be somebody big!

They started engines and taxied to line up on runway 04 (heading north/east) and opened full power for the take-off. It was slow to gather speed and almost ran to the other end before the Captain gently eased the control column back and got the lumbering DC-3 to get airborne. The instant Capt. Seneviratne lifted the plane he would have known something was very wrong. The old Dakota was climbing foot by foot while the F/O retracted the gear and the flaps. The aeroplane was still not climbing, the two pilots knew they were flying a heavily over-weight aeroplane which had been loaded with total disregard for its centre of gravity.

From here onwards I am writing exactly what First Officer Jayawickrema told me. This is no fairy tale, but some clever piece of flying which was completely out of the box.

The old Dakota crawled to 1500 feet and stopped climbing. Too heavy and completely out of trim. The Captain turned left and stayed on top of the northern Bolgoda Lake and followed the waterway to Dehiwela. There they turned left and followed the snaking canal to the sea, safe from tall buildings at 1500 ft. Once they crossed the rail-track and the beach, they turned North and flew over the water parallel to the coast. Now they were safe at this low altitude and the Captain sent the First Officer to check the situation in the cabin. There were 24 seats and 38 passengers and so many ammunition boxes that were loaded on the floor at the back. The seatless passengers had conveniently sat on the iron boxes and made themselves comfortable. No wonder the Dakota was over-weight and completely out of trim. It was a minor miracle the Dakota made it to 1500 ft. The pilots decided to fly low level over the sea and head North and somewhere near Kalpitiya to turn right and make a direct track to Vavuniya.

The Captain called the leader of the soldiers and explained and requested the passengers who had no seats to bring the ammo boxes forward along the aisle and the soldiers to sit on them. This was clever thinking. Boxes and men shifted up the aisle, the aircraft was better balanced after the seatless passengers re-located. However, the crew stuck to their original plan to coast-crawl and managed to climb a little too. They flew past Negombo, Chilaw, spotted Deduru-Oya and Puttalam and reached Kalpitiya. There they turned right to track to Vauniya, flying over Wilpattu and Thanthirimalai. The fading sun was still giving enough light and they came to Vavuniya and spotted a clearing amidst the scrub bush. The runway was just a flat strip, a relic from the old second world war days where the RAF had a squadron of Hurricanes based in Vavuniya. That was all gone now and there was only a little hut and a watcher who was there to guard (I do not know from what) but perhaps to chase the cattle that strayed on to the airfield.

The DC-3 usually approached to land at 65-70 knots. But the crew knew she weighed so much more than her maximum landing weight with ammo boxes and 38 passengers. The pilots had to come much faster to land and to avoid stalling the plane. The Dakota did not have stall warning devices. Capt. Seneviratne compromised and made his approach to runway 05 at 100 knots. It would have been an extremely difficult task, an over-weight DC-3 approaching at 100 knots, on a short field of around 1500 meters. There were no guide lights or runway markings to gauge the descent path. The flare alone would have been so difficult to judge; the deck sure was stacked against the pilots, nerve-racking to say the least.

They touched down and went straight for the brakes, but the speed was too high and the runway too short. The Dakota over ran the threshold on the far end and went into a ditch that was full of mud. The nose was down, and the tail was up but no one was hurt.

Considering all factors including the part they over ran the short, unmarked runway, I think it was a brilliant piece of flying. From take-off to touch down it was all seat of the pants out of the box handling and decision-making. My humble opinion says if one was to study everything that happened and how they survived – this sure was a class act.

The soldiers disembarked carrying their ammunition and the crew followed. They inspected the Dakota and saw nothing had happened to the rugged aeroplane except some torn canvases in the tailplane. Ropes were brought and the 38 soldiers pushed and pulled the Dakota and got it out of the ditch. Her wheels were caked with mud and the wheel bays too were pretty badly soiled. Once the soldiers got the aeroplane to hard ground they turned it to face runway 23. The pilots got in and they had to do a battery start. This was tricky, but the crew knew their business. The starter rotated the prop, fuel flowed, ignitors fired, and the engine coughed and smoked as the 14 cylinders came to life. That sure is the sweetest sound from a Pratt and Whitney engine. Both engines started singing and it was all set to go; the Dakota took off on runway 23 and flew to Ratmalana.

They radioed Engineering in Ratmalana and told the Vavuniya story. The men who manned Ratmalana were a special breed.They were ‘Hammer and Spanner’ trouble-fixers who were Grand Masters of the DC-3. By the time the Dakota landed the engineers were ready with high pressure hoses to peel the mud off and also had an expert to stitch the torn tail plane canvas. Some names I remember. It is my privilege to mention them. G.V. Perera, Noel Peiris, Sath Silva, JCT, Quintus Gunasekara, Piya. I remember, the rest were equally good, but I am sad I cannot re-collect all the names.

The engineers took over the aeroplane and the pilots went home.

The following morning my friend Jayawickrema rode his bicycle and came to the airport. The DC-3 was taxiing out for take-off, on the morning flight to Jaffna.

“She looked the beauty she always was” he nostalgically murmured. “Even spruced up by her high-pressure water bath. I couldn’t believe this was the same aeroplane that made an approach at 100 knots to land at a short strip in Vavuniya and ended up in a ditch, full of mud.”

Some pilots crash and die, and some survive. The script is decided by fate that flings the dice. You win some, you lose some and if you are lucky, you live to tell the tale.

Some call it consecration; some call it God.

It is as simple as that.","Conspiracy Theorists, Political Blackguards and Patience",island.lk

India is perennially doing a tightrope walk to maintain the fiscal deficit but we have not thought of long-term provisioning for the country’s needs.

With each year passing, our asking rate of GDP growth per capita is increasing, slowly sliding the country into a potential long-term crisis and a possible downgrade.

One path-breaking idea for this year’s budget could be to set up the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), unique from any other SWFs in the world.

This SWF should catalyse India’s growth, become the new nucleus of its growth story, and secure its future generations in meeting spending needs for development.

Sixty-five countries have already established at least one SWF. More so, SWFs in the developing economies have a pivotal role in the country’s financial architecture. The assets under the SWFs increased from $3 trillion in 2008 to $10.6 trillion by 2014, and was expected to touch $15 trillion by 2020.

This trend is likely to increase. If we look at Norway, its GDP is just $414 billion, but its assets under the management (AUM) of the SWF is three times the size of its GDP at approximately $1.2 trillion.

Similarly, if we add all the SWFs of China, the total AUM of the SWFs is $2.2 trillion (including the Hong Kong SAR). Similarly, Abu Dhabi has an AUM of $579.62 billion while its GDP is $354 billion, and the same is the case of most of the countries where the AUM of the SWFs exceed the GDP of their nation.

There is a wonderful opportunity for India setting up its SWF. In 2015, India set up the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund with an investment of Rs 20,000 crore for co-investing in domestic infrastructure projects. In my view, this was too late, too little, and is just an infrastructure investment fund and not what India could have leveraged from a SWF.

The Bharat Sovereign Wealth & Development Fund should have precise functions; one is to manage the money/wealth and grow it, and the second is to be an active investor. The structure should be vertical-based. On the wealth and money manager role, it should manage the performing and non-performing assets both and grow them, and on the investor side, it must invest in existing and emerging sectors.

India can transfer the government’s land bank into this SWF along with its holding in PSUs, portion of RBI profits and Forex reserves and Employees Provident Fund, and offset clause deals could be parked into this SWF. India should contribute 1 percent of the tax receipts to SWF.

Also, SWF can set up co-investing deals with other funds, family offices and institutions. SWF can leapfrog India’s economy with a quantum jump, and that too, with multi-dimensional impact. If the idea is executed well, India’s SWF may be around $3-5 trillion to start with, and it can become $10 trillion in the next decade.

The SWF can strategise the sectors and countries where it needs to invest and create holdings in key economies of the world and critical sectors. When the SWF invests in companies across the world, it can push the organisations where it invests to start operations or offices in India, thereby creating local jobs.

If India had a SWF, it would have invested in vaccine research across the globe, catapulting the country into a world leader for Covid vaccine. SWF can secure future generations and help make provision for India’s needs for social security for its aging population and other development needs.

Once this SWF grows, it can help balance short-term fiscal positions for the government, insulate the budget and economy against volatility (generally commodity price fluctuations), serve as an additional policy tool for meeting government payment and foreign exchange, besides creating long-term assets with social impact.

Also, it can balance private sector anti-competitive practices and monopolies. SWF can provide the risk and growth capital, and support India in creating $3-5 trillion Indian corporations by 2035. The vision should be long-term investments in early and growth-stage companies and sectors.

SWF can invest in companies that have a scope for listing, and may deliver the highest return on their listing. On the verticals, it could address the existing and new or emerging sectors.

The sectoral and vertical focus could help cross-subsidise. It is important for the SWF to be insulated from political interference, bureaucratic controls and judicial interventions. India’s SWF should look at a minimum annual return of more than 10 percent.

The country, from being just among the top investment destinations for SWFs, should have its SWF to invest in the top investment destinations. SWF could turbo-charge India’s growth story and this year’s budget should consider this idea.",A fund to trigger a USD 10 trillion economy,www.newindianexpress.com
615,616,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-fires-trump-appointed-heads-200712450.html,"The Biden administration has fired the heads of three US-funded international broadcasters that were appointed by Donald Trump.

The acting chief of the US Agency for Global Media dismissed the directors of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, reports say.

Mr Biden had also forced Mr Trump’s pick to run the USAGM to resign with hours of stepping foot in the White House.

The latest changes come just a day after the director of Voice of America and his deputy were removed and the chief of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting stood down, according to NPR.

The now former head of the USAGM, Michael Pack, had been accused by Democrats of trying to turn the networks into pro-Trump propaganda outfits.

All of those fired by the acting CEO of USAGM, Kelu Chao, were only appointed by Mr Pack, who had claimed that its newsrooms were filled with anti-Trump journalists, in December.

It is unclear if the firings of Victoria Coates of MEBN, Stephen Yates of RFA and Ted Lipien of RFE, will be subject to legal challenges, reports NPR.

""We have a lot of work ahead of us: reaffirm the firewall, the highest standards of professionalism, and the sacred editorial independence and journalistic integrity; and ensure the safety and security of our journalists,"" Ms Chao wrote in a memo to staff before the firings.

Immigration has been one of the toughest issues for Congress to tackle, and the legislation’s fate is unclear in a House in which Democrats wield narrower control than in the past and a 50-50 Senate where Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie vote for Democrats.

But Biden has pledged to act swiftly on immigration, and his proposed legislation is accompanied by executive actions including halting construction on the border wall, ending the Trump administration ban on U.S. entry for people from Muslim-majority nations and pausing some deportations.

The Biden administration released a summary of its bill, the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would also allow applicants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival to apply for permanent residency.

DACA is an Obama administration initiative for individuals brought into the country illegally as children, and there are more than 700,000 people enrolled.

The proposal is a stark difference from the Trump administration, which spent four years assaulting any form of immigration in the U.S., from trying to eliminate the DACA program to separating families at the border. The last time the U.S. passed sweeping immigration reform was 1986.

“Today, President Biden turned the page on a dark chapter in American history,” House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said in a statement. “The time to fix our broken immigration system is long overdue, and I look forward to working with President Biden and his Administration towards securing much needed reforms.”

If passed by Congress, the bill would allow undocumented individuals such as DACA recipients, Temporary Protective Status holders and “immigrant farmworkers who meet specific requirements” to apply for temporary legal status. After five years, those individuals could apply for green cards if they pass background checks and show they pay taxes.

After three more years, those green card holders could apply to become citizens if they again pass background checks and pass the citizenship test.

While the bill would likely pass the House, it’s unclear if Democrats have enough votes in the Senate.

The last time Democrats tried to pass a bipartisan immigration bill that would have laid out a path to citizenship within 13 years for undocumented people was in 2013. It passed the Senate, 68-32, but was never brought to the House floor under Republican control.

Even without Congress, the Biden administration Department of Homeland Security is moving forward with pausing removal of noncitizens who are under deportation orders “to ensure we have a fair and effective immigration enforcement system focused on protecting national security, border security, and public safety,” the agency said in a memo Wednesday.

“The pause will allow DHS to ensure that its resources are dedicated to responding to the most pressing challenges that the United States faces, including immediate operational challenges at the southwest border in the midst of the most serious global public health crisis in a century,” the agency said.

Biden’s bill reforms family-based immigration by allowing “immigrants with approved family-sponsorship petitions to join family in the United States on a temporary basis while they wait for green cards to become available.” It also clears backlogs, eliminates wait times and increases the number of per-country visa caps.

The bill would also improve immigration courts by expanding programs to manage family cases, which would reduce backlogs in court and also expand training for judges to handle those cases.

A large section of the proposal also aims to deal with the causes of mass migration.

The bill allocates $4 billion to address migration in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, with the goal of reducing “corruption, violence, and poverty that causes people to flee their home countries.” It would also reinstate the Central American Minors program, which reunites children with their relatives in the U.S., and would also create “the Central American Family Reunification Parole Program to more quickly unite families with approved family sponsorship petitions.”

Republicans and other members of the GOP have already voiced their opposition to Biden’s immigration reform plan.

National Republican Senatorial Committee Spokesman Chris Hartline said in a statement that the proposal was radical.

“The proposal by President Biden would give amnesty to eleven million illegal immigrants with no effort whatsoever to secure the border,” he said.

However, the proposal does address security at the border and focuses on using technology to screen for narcotics and other contraband at various checkpoints.

It also allows for the expansion of investigations into drug trafficking and allows DHS to develop strategies to improve ports of entries for asylum seekers.",Biden immigration overhaul would open a door to citizenship for 11 million people,www.bryantimes.com

""At this point, police are aware of six suspected overdose deaths,"" Lt. Tim Kehoe with Chesterfield Police Special Investigations Division said.

Kehoe said the high number of overdoses in a short period of time likely means ""illegal or prescription drugs being sold or used are extremely potent and likely to cause an overdose.""

As a result, officials urged anyone who is with a person who overdoses to call 911 immediately.

""Administer Narcan/Naloxone if you have access to it,"" Kehoe advised. ""If you or someone you know needs Narcan, call 804-717-6169. The Chesterfield County Opioid Outreach Coordinator can provide it free of charge.""

Police released the following information about possible overdoses.
• Breathing is slow, shallow or has stopped

What to do if you see a suspected overdose:
• If you have Narcan/Naloxone, administer it and perform rescue breathing
• If the victim does not respond after 2-3 minutes, give a second dose of Narcan/Naloxone
• Do not leave the person alone; help will arrive
• If the person starts to breathe or becomes more alert, lay them in the recovery position: put the person slightly on their left side so their body is supported by the left knee with their face turned to the side and their bottom arm reaching out to stabilize their position

That’ll definitely affect the elections. Netanyahu’s adversaries would in that case say ‘you failed.’ But Biden won’t do it because of that, but just because it’s his policy.”

Netanyahu is “an expert politician and statesman,” Zell said. “I think he recognizes that the playing field has changed, and he has to adjust accordingly.

620,621,https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2021/01/who-will-preside-over-the-senate-trial.php,"The effort by Democrats to impeach and convict President Trump is raising questions that, in a well-functioning society, would be reserved for law school exams. In such a society, Trump wouldn’t have acted as he did during his final days and Democrats would be content with the fact that those were his final days.

One question raised is whether a president can be impeached after he leaves office. A second is who presides over such an impeachment trial.

The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides when a sitting president is tried by the Senate. But in the case of an ex-president, the answer is less clear.

The Constitution says: “When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.” But Donald Trump is not the president. Thus, if he can be tried as an ex-president, the Constitution doesn’t require that the Chief Justice preside. The presumption, I suppose, is that he will not preside — that, instead, the vice president will, as she normally does over Senate proceedings.

I imagine the main reason for having the Chief Justice preside in the case of a sitting president is to avoid a conflict of interest. The vice president might well have an interest in the outcome of such a trial because she would ascend to the presidency in the event of removal.

Kamala Harris is not conflicted in this case in that way. She will not become president if Trump is convicted.

Nonetheless, Harris has a conflict of interest, and not just because she’s a partisan Democrat asked to preside over a partisan proceeding. If Trump is convicted, he can then be barred, by a simple majority vote, from holding office again. If not convicted, Trump might well be on the ballot as a presidential candidate in 2024, either as the Republican nominee or the nominee of his own party.

Harris will likely be on the ballot in 2024, maybe as the Democratic candidate for vice president or maybe as its presidential nominee. Thus, she has a personal stake in the outcome of the impeachment trial (though whether it cuts in favor of conviction or against it can be debated).

Personally, I hope Harris presides. An impeachment trial of an ex-president doesn’t deserve the dignity of the Chief Justice’s presence. With Harris presiding, the proceeding will look all the more absurd and all the more partisan. So, quite possibly, will Harris.

In addition, Harris may make rulings that further alienate her from Republican members. Thus, it might diminish the chances for collegiality in the Senate, which I hope are already slight.",Who will preside over the Senate trial?,www.powerlineblog.com
621,622,https://island.lk/trump-walks-out-of-the-white-house-into-a-minefield-of-legal-perils/,"The present-day sky is crowded. Airways crisscross above continents and oceans and are severely congested with all kinds of aeroplanes carrying passengers and cargo. Then someone crashes, people die, and we say, “What a shame!” The manufacturers start defending their aeroplane, the insurance companies look for loopholes to creep through and save their bacon. Of course, there is always the ever-present ‘pilot error’ verdict to take the final blame. That is what happens in air crashes and crash causes. The dying or the surviving is seldom man-made. It is all done upstairs and has little to do with what we deduce from what we know or hear. I have seen enough of the sky and what happens in it to figure that out.

On 7 August 1997, a Fine Air DC-8-61F took off from Miami International on a direct flight to Santo Domingo. It was a cargo flight, two pilots and a Flight Engineer plus a security officer were the only occupants. The DC-8 rolled off on Runway 27 Right and eased into the azure blue Florida sky.

That’s when the trouble started. The first officer was flying, and he could not control the pitch attitude of the aeroplane, and the nose kept creeping up. The speed started bleeding off and the big cargo jet stalled and crashed 3000 ft beyond the end of the runway. It instantly killed the four people on board and also a luckless motorist who was passing on the road beyond the airfield.

The investigation proved the DC-8 was loaded incorrectly by the cargo people and the trim settings shown were wrong.

The load sheet is given to the Captain a few minutes before the doors are closed. It shows how the aeroplane is loaded and how the centre of gravity is calculated by the load master who decides how the payload should be distributed. If he makes a mistake, and the Captain fails to notice it, no one would know that till the aeroplane rotates and the pitch attitude misbehaves. At times it could become almost impossible to fly the aeroplane.

That’s one down and two to go of the three stories.

The Ethiopian 707 cargo aeroplane was loaded and ready for takeoff in Fiumicino Airport in Rome on 19th November 1977. It was a two-sector flight, first to Asmara and then to Addis Ababa, carrying a consignment of tyres. There were five onboard, the two pilots and the Flight Engineer and two security officers.

The aeroplane was almost fully loaded with heavy cargo plus 11,000 gallons of fuel. The Captain checked the load sheet and calculated the take-off power needed and set the stabilizer trim according to the units that were displayed in the load sheet.

The 707 rolled out of Fiumicino and took off. It is not clear what happened; the theories are multiple. The 707 could not be controlled in the pitching and nosedived to a scrub bush jungle on the extended centerline of the runway.

All five people in the aircraft died. The 11,000 gallons of fuel burned the fuselage to cinders. Maybe the calculated trim was wrong or maybe the loading of the cargo was not according to centre of gravity limits. Some even said the cargo pallets may have shifted. Either way, the five people who died lost their lives in vain, perhaps due to a loading mistake.

And now I come to the third aeroplane, the one that got away.

No, this I did not take from any record book; nor is it a trumped-up story from a third or fourth party. This is straight from the horse’s mouth. It was the surviving pilot who laid bare all the facts of this incredible story. Captain Jaya Seneviratne is no more, he passed away some years ago. First Officer Nihal Jayawickrema flew almost every jet aeroplane that served Sri Lanka and retired after being the Director of Flight Operations in the national carrier. I write this in honour of these two pilots. Let the truth be on record, stated as it happened so that such professional pinnacles are remembered and told and re-told for future generations.

The year was 1971. The JVP had taken up arms to fight the ruling coalition of the Sirimavo Bandaranaike government. At the start the armed forces were ill-prepared to contain the onslaught of the youth uprising. The pendulum swung both ways and hundreds from the two sides died in vain. I better stop that sad story now before I forget my purpose and blast away at things that are best left unsaid.

Ammunition and soldiers had to be moved to fight the JVP. Road transport was difficult due to guerilla-type ambushers. The safest was by air, load an old DC-3 and fly wherever you wanted. Such was the plan when Capt. Seneviratne and F/O Jayawickrema got onboard to fly from Ratmalana to Vavuniya. They had to carry some soldiers and a lot of ammunition boxes that weighed like concrete blocks. Of course, there were no cabin crew, and strangely more passengers than seats, more like military musical chairs. The plane had to fly to Vavuniya, unload soldiers and ammo and return empty to Ratmalana. Of course, whoever ordered the flight had thrown away the rule book. There was no LOAD SHEET. This was an emergency; nobody knew how much the payload weighed and where the trim sheet centre of gravity was. The Captain was a grizzly old school veteran, and the F/O was a bright young spark, and between them they were more than capable of flying to Vavuniya and back. Passengers seated and standing, limitlessly over-loading, and with enough ammunition to make it a flying bomb if any emergency occurred, somebody sure had vapourised the rule book. Had to be somebody big!

They started engines and taxied to line up on runway 04 (heading north/east) and opened full power for the take-off. It was slow to gather speed and almost ran to the other end before the Captain gently eased the control column back and got the lumbering DC-3 to get airborne. The instant Capt. Seneviratne lifted the plane he would have known something was very wrong. The old Dakota was climbing foot by foot while the F/O retracted the gear and the flaps. The aeroplane was still not climbing, the two pilots knew they were flying a heavily over-weight aeroplane which had been loaded with total disregard for its centre of gravity.

From here onwards I am writing exactly what First Officer Jayawickrema told me. This is no fairy tale, but some clever piece of flying which was completely out of the box.

The old Dakota crawled to 1500 feet and stopped climbing. Too heavy and completely out of trim. The Captain turned left and stayed on top of the northern Bolgoda Lake and followed the waterway to Dehiwela. There they turned left and followed the snaking canal to the sea, safe from tall buildings at 1500 ft. Once they crossed the rail-track and the beach, they turned North and flew over the water parallel to the coast. Now they were safe at this low altitude and the Captain sent the First Officer to check the situation in the cabin. There were 24 seats and 38 passengers and so many ammunition boxes that were loaded on the floor at the back. The seatless passengers had conveniently sat on the iron boxes and made themselves comfortable. No wonder the Dakota was over-weight and completely out of trim. It was a minor miracle the Dakota made it to 1500 ft. The pilots decided to fly low level over the sea and head North and somewhere near Kalpitiya to turn right and make a direct track to Vavuniya.

The Captain called the leader of the soldiers and explained and requested the passengers who had no seats to bring the ammo boxes forward along the aisle and the soldiers to sit on them. This was clever thinking. Boxes and men shifted up the aisle, the aircraft was better balanced after the seatless passengers re-located. However, the crew stuck to their original plan to coast-crawl and managed to climb a little too. They flew past Negombo, Chilaw, spotted Deduru-Oya and Puttalam and reached Kalpitiya. There they turned right to track to Vauniya, flying over Wilpattu and Thanthirimalai. The fading sun was still giving enough light and they came to Vavuniya and spotted a clearing amidst the scrub bush. The runway was just a flat strip, a relic from the old second world war days where the RAF had a squadron of Hurricanes based in Vavuniya. That was all gone now and there was only a little hut and a watcher who was there to guard (I do not know from what) but perhaps to chase the cattle that strayed on to the airfield.

The DC-3 usually approached to land at 65-70 knots. But the crew knew she weighed so much more than her maximum landing weight with ammo boxes and 38 passengers. The pilots had to come much faster to land and to avoid stalling the plane. The Dakota did not have stall warning devices. Capt. Seneviratne compromised and made his approach to runway 05 at 100 knots. It would have been an extremely difficult task, an over-weight DC-3 approaching at 100 knots, on a short field of around 1500 meters. There were no guide lights or runway markings to gauge the descent path. The flare alone would have been so difficult to judge; the deck sure was stacked against the pilots, nerve-racking to say the least.

They touched down and went straight for the brakes, but the speed was too high and the runway too short. The Dakota over ran the threshold on the far end and went into a ditch that was full of mud. The nose was down, and the tail was up but no one was hurt.

Considering all factors including the part they over ran the short, unmarked runway, I think it was a brilliant piece of flying. From take-off to touch down it was all seat of the pants out of the box handling and decision-making. My humble opinion says if one was to study everything that happened and how they survived – this sure was a class act.

The soldiers disembarked carrying their ammunition and the crew followed. They inspected the Dakota and saw nothing had happened to the rugged aeroplane except some torn canvases in the tailplane. Ropes were brought and the 38 soldiers pushed and pulled the Dakota and got it out of the ditch. Her wheels were caked with mud and the wheel bays too were pretty badly soiled. Once the soldiers got the aeroplane to hard ground they turned it to face runway 23. The pilots got in and they had to do a battery start. This was tricky, but the crew knew their business. The starter rotated the prop, fuel flowed, ignitors fired, and the engine coughed and smoked as the 14 cylinders came to life. That sure is the sweetest sound from a Pratt and Whitney engine. Both engines started singing and it was all set to go; the Dakota took off on runway 23 and flew to Ratmalana.

They radioed Engineering in Ratmalana and told the Vavuniya story. The men who manned Ratmalana were a special breed.They were ‘Hammer and Spanner’ trouble-fixers who were Grand Masters of the DC-3. By the time the Dakota landed the engineers were ready with high pressure hoses to peel the mud off and also had an expert to stitch the torn tail plane canvas. Some names I remember. It is my privilege to mention them. G.V. Perera, Noel Peiris, Sath Silva, JCT, Quintus Gunasekara, Piya. I remember, the rest were equally good, but I am sad I cannot re-collect all the names.

The engineers took over the aeroplane and the pilots went home.

The following morning my friend Jayawickrema rode his bicycle and came to the airport. The DC-3 was taxiing out for take-off, on the morning flight to Jaffna.

“She looked the beauty she always was” he nostalgically murmured. “Even spruced up by her high-pressure water bath. I couldn’t believe this was the same aeroplane that made an approach at 100 knots to land at a short strip in Vavuniya and ended up in a ditch, full of mud.”

Some pilots crash and die, and some survive. The script is decided by fate that flings the dice. You win some, you lose some and if you are lucky, you live to tell the tale.

Some call it consecration; some call it God.

622,623,https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/politics/mypillow-guy-among-the-trump-acolytes-picking-up-the-torch/2533752/,"When Mike Lindell, better known to TV viewers as the MyPillow Guy, went to the White House last week to try to persuade President Donald Trump to keep pushing bogus theories about the election, he came away disappointed. Unexpectedly, Trump passed him — and his claims about sabotaged voting machines — off on staffers. But the Trump true believer says he has something from Trump that softens that blow: the promise of an endorsement.

The president has told him before that he would back his bid for governor of Minnesota, Lindell told The Associated Press. “Mike, if you did it, I would get behind you,” Lindell said Trump told him.

It's a prospect that sends shivers down the spines of some Republicans in the state — where Trump lost by 7 percentage points — and cuts to the heart of the national party's existential crisis. While many Republicans, particularly those in Washington, are eager to move on from the former president and his personality-driven, racially divisive politics, Trump's acolytes across the country are already preparing to pick up the torch.

GOP state parties across the country are starting to look ahead to divisive primary fights that will test Trump's hold on Republican voters. In Wyoming, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney drew a primary challenge shortly after voting to impeach Trump for his role in the deadly riot on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol. And in Virginia, which holds its governor's election this year, a Trump-style Republican, state Sen. Amanda Chase, is running for the party's nomination, even as she was recently stripped of her committee assignments for comments calling the rioters “patriots.""

In states like Virginia and Minnesota, there's little evidence that embracing Trump is a path to success for Republicans. Trump lost Virginia by 10 percentage points in November. And despite repeated visits and millions spent in Minnesota, Trump's campaign tanked in the state, as suburban voters around the Twin Cities soundly rejected him.

“The Republican brand has become toxic in the eyes of too many young people, formerly supportive suburbanites, women and diverse voters,"" said former Gov. Tim Pawlenty, an establishment Republican who lost a comeback run for governor in 2018.

“We don't need to guess how a general election campaign will go here for any candidate viewed mostly as a Trump proxy. Trump lost here twice and it wasn't even close the second time.”

Still, after four years of Trump's leadership, it's not easy finding an active Republican in the state who hasn't aligned with Trump. The field of Republicans considering campaigns is dominated by pro-Trump conservatives.

They include state Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, a soft-spoken insurance agent who joined many Republicans around the country in fighting governors' lockdown orders and COVID precautions, even as a Republican state senator died of complications from COVID-19 that he may have contracted at a party event. Also on the list is former state Sen. Scott Jensen, a doctor who has suggested that the COVID-19 toll has been inflated; U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber, who backed some efforts to overturn the election results before ultimately voting to affirm Biden’s victory; and former Minnesota Vikings lineman Matt Birk, a religious conservative who declared publicly he wouldn’t take the coronavirus vaccine.

Lindell is a distinctly Trump-era figure. Just a few years ago, he was best known for campy late-night infomercials to sell his pillows, and for his frequently told back story of overcoming crack cocaine addiction. He said he wasn't political until he met Trump in 2016, connected with a fellow businessman and soon became a vocal Trump true believer and donor.

By his own estimate, Lindell was a warm-up speaker at more than 60 Trump campaign rallies, drawing frequent shout-outs from the president and co-chairing Trump's Minnesota campaign.

As the coronavirus crisis deepened, Lindell caught flak in August for championing the unproven treatment of oleander after investing in a company that produced a compound from it.

Then, after the election, Lindell shared Trump's refusal to accept Biden as the winner. Many of his claims about the outcome were labeled by Twitter as disputed. He posted but later deleted a tweet in December calling on Trump to declare martial law and seize the ballots and voting machines in seven key states. While he said he opposed the Capitol insurrection, MyPillow’s logo was prominently featured on a website that promoted the Jan. 6 Trump rally that preceded the riot. Lindell has claimed “antifa” was responsible for the riot, even though authorities say there’s no evidence of that. He said he’s still holding out hope that the U.S. Supreme Court would somehow put Trump back in office.

And he believes his unflinching support for Trump would be a strong asset if he runs for the GOP nomination to challenge Democratic incumbent Tim Walz.

“Of course it would help. Why wouldn't it help? The guy was the best president in history,"" Lindell said, praising Trump's response to the pandemic and his economic policies.

Lindell would come to the race with name recognition from his TV ads, which run frequently on Fox News and other channels. And he presumably could at least partly self-fund his campaign, though he claimed not to know his net worth and said he had no idea what a run for governor would cost.

Veteran GOP operative Gregg Peppin, who isn't working for any potential gubernatorial candidate so far, said “some of the less believable stories” that Lindell has embraced certainly wouldn't help him in the general election.

Former Republican operative Michael Brodkorb, a former deputy state party chairman, went even further, saying it would be a disaster for the party if Lindell is its candidate against Walz.

“While Republicans have gained some seats in a patchwork across the state, winning statewide has been a much trickier puzzle for them to solve,"" Brodkorb said. ""It bends any political logic that Mike Lindell is going to be any key to helping Republicans solve that puzzle. He has done everything since the election to perpetuate what we now know are dangerous statements.”

As Lindell weighs a run, his immediate future includes business and potential legal challenges. His amplification of Trump’s false claims of election fraud led some major retailers, including Bed Bath & Beyond and Kohl’s, to discontinue MyPillow products. And the parent company of Dominion Voting Systems, which has already sued pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell for defamation, has demanded that Lindell retract his accusations that its voting machines played a role in Trump’s loss.

Lindell said he's not worried. It's the retailers' loss if they succumb to pressure, he said. And he said he won't let up on Dominion.

“You bring it on, Dominion, because I want everybody to see,” he said.",MyPillow Guy Among the Trump Acolytes Picking Up the Torch,www.nbcdfw.com
623,624,https://www.columbian.com/news/2021/jan/23/maduro-sent-letter-to-irans-leader-accrediting-u-s-fugitive/,"MIAMI — A Colombian businessman was carrying a letter from Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accrediting him to Iran’s supreme leader when he was arrested on a U.S. warrant last year, according to a new court filing in a politically charged corruption case ratcheting up tensions with the South American nation. Attorneys for Alex Saab made the filing in Miami federal court Thursday just hours after prosecutors in the African nation of Cape Verde said they granted the 49-year-old Colombian house arrest as he fights extradition to the U.S. to face money laundering charges. U.S. officials believe Saab holds numerous secrets about how Maduro, his family and top aides allegedly siphoned off millions of dollars in government contracts amid widespread hunger in the oil-rich nation. He was detained last June when his jet made a refueling stop on a flight to Tehran, where he was allegedly sent to negotiate deals to exchange Venezuelan gold for Iranian gasoline. The Trump administration made Saab’s extradition a top priority, at one point even sending a Navy warship to the African archipelago to keep an eye on the captive and discourage any plans by Venezuela to try to sneak him out of jail. In Caracas, Saab’s prosecution is seen as a veiled attempt at regime change and is likely to complicate any effort by Maduro to seek a fresh start with the Biden administration, as is the continued imprisonment of several Americans in Caracas, including six Venezuelan-American oil executives and two former Green Berets caught in a failed raid seeking to capture Maduro.

Lawyers at the Baker & Hostetler law firm filed a motion seeking to dismiss the U.S. charges, arguing Saab is immune from prosecution as a result of the many diplomatic posts he has held for Maduro’s government since 2018. As evidence, they presented letters signed by Maduro’s foreign minister purportedly accrediting Saab as a special envoy for humanitarian aid as well as a resolution — signed last month — naming him Venezuela’s alternate permanent representative to the African Union in Ethiopia. There is also a letter, addressed to Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in which Maduro asks the Iranian supreme leader to help Saab obtain an “urgent” shipment of 5 million barrels of gasoline following the arrival of several previous shipments from Iran. Another apparent diplomatic note, from the Iranian Embassy in Caracas, refers to Saab’s upcoming “official” visit and a request for the delivery of Iranian-made medicines. “The arrival of the Iranian petroleum ships has marked a historic milestone in our bilateral relations and firmly and decisively sealed the love of the Venezuelan people for Iran,” Maduro wrote in the June 11 letter, which Saab was purportedly carrying at the time of his arrest. “The collective emotion of Venezuela when the vessels carrying the Iranian flag arrived in our juris dictional waters is indicative of a victory in the relations between sovereign states, never subjected to any empire.” The Trump administration in 2019 recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader, closed the U.S. Embassy in Caracas and imposed stiff oil sanctions on Maduro’s socialist government.

Saab’s attorneys argue that the U.S. campaign against Maduro, who himself was indicted in New York federal court on drug trafficking charges, is no substitute for international law. “The irregular diplomatic relations between the United States and Venezuela do not permit the Court to ignore the Vienna Convention,” Saab’s attorneys said in the filing. “Whatever its opinion of Mr. Maduro, the United States continues to recognize Venezuela as a sovereign member of the community of nations, and the law of nations requires it to respect that state’s sovereign rights, including to dispatch diplomatic emissaries to any other country in the world.” Federal prosecutors in Miami indicted Saab in 2019 on money laundering charges connected to an alleged bribery scheme that pocketed more than $350 million from a low-income housing project for the Venezuelan government that was never built. The dismissal motion cites the late 1980s prosecution of former Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega to argue that Saab should be allowed to enter a defense even before extradition. Normally, defendants who are considered fugitives are barred from being heard in federal court. Saab’s attorneys also challenge the U.S. court’s jurisdiction, saying that Saab hasn’t traveled to the U.S. in nearly three decades and that proceeds from the alleged scheme were deposited into Miami bank accounts belonging to unnamed co-conspirators.

“The United States has only the barest alleged connection to the underlying supposed crimes,” the filing said. Venezuela’s government has vehemently objected to Saab’s prosecution as a veiled attempt at regime change by the Trump administration and have ordered him to resist extradition at all costs. “We have reasonable grounds to believe that if you are extradited to the United States, you will be put under pressure, whether legitimately or not, to disclose that information and thus put our country at great risk,” says a letter signed by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza that was part of Thursday’s filing. A court in Cape Verde ruled this month that Saab can be extradited to the U.S. although the island nation’s Supreme Court must give final approval. On Thursday, prosecutors in the island nation said they were moving Saab to house arrest while the appeals process plays out because he had already been detained longer than the maximum allowed.

Saab’s legal team in the extradition case, which is led by Spanish jurist Baltasar Garzon, celebrated the decision as long overdue, saying he spent seven months in jail in “inhumane conditions” that exacerbated his health problems. Under home detention, Saab can now receive proper treatment, the attorneys said in a statement. “We will continue to appeal and demand respect for Alex Saab’s diplomatic immunity and that his extradition to the U.S. be rejected as unfounded because it is a clear case of political persecution in pursuit of a larger objective, in this case the government of Venezuela,” Garzon said in a statement.",Maduro sent letter to Iran’s leader accrediting U.S. fugitive,www.columbian.com

State health officials reported 5,859 new virus infections on Saturday, boosting the final weekly total to 38,344 for an average of 5,476 a day — a figure 24% lower than the prior week.

The weekly pandemic caseload was the lowest since the week of Nov. 1, when 30,030 infections (a daily average of 4,290) were reported prior to the spike that month in which ever-growing numbers of cases spiraled into December.

The latest weekly total is less than half of Ohio's peak week. Padded by about 13,000 back-dated rapid tests added to that total, Ohio posted a record high 86,209 virus cases (a daily average of 12,290) during the week of Dec. 6. Even without the back-dated cases, the week easily was the worst of the pandemic.

However, while lower, the latest weekly daily average is multiples worse than many days last summer when daily COVID infections did not top 1,000.

Gov. Mike DeWine has welcomed the lower infection counts, but said the numbers remain too high to drop the 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. overnight COVID curfew that was extended one week on Friday, through Jan. 30.

Coronavirus cases may be down, but deaths — with 93% occurring among those age 60 or above — remain at a high level.

The state reported 81 more COVID-19 fatalities on Saturday, increasing January's death count to 1,718 — the second-highest monthly total of the pandemic. A record 2,533 virus deaths were reported in December.

The declining case numbers also are reflected in the number of Ohioans requiring inpatient treatment. A well-below-average 166 hospitalizations were reported Saturday, with total virus admissions at 3,116 — a decrease of 31% over the past two months.

The state now has recorded 859,841 virus infections — one in every 14 Ohioans — and 10,680 deaths since the first confirmed cases arose on March 9.

COVID-19 in Ohio: State ranks last in getting second shots into arms

The seven-day average of tests returning positive for COVID-19 stands at 9.9%, also reflecting the downward infections, after reaching 16% in early December.

The number of Ohioans receiving vaccinations totaled 575,003 as of Saturday, with those who have received at least the first shots now totaling 4.9% of the state's population of nearly 11.7 million.

While it doesn't begin to even have enough vaccine doses to inoculate all who are eligible, the state has authorized shots for Ohioans age 75 and older beginning Monday after the public rollout began with those age 80 and older.

628,629,https://gazette.com/premium/more-than-half-of-americans-are-confused-about-vaccine-info-study-finds/article_af30148a-5ce2-11eb-9852-6b5161ce66d9.html,"If the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine has you feeling frustrated and confused, you’re not alone.

Despite federal, state and local campaigns meant to clarify and streamline the process, a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 6 in 10 older Americans still say they haven't received enough information about the vaccine, and about one-third of adults aren't sure when or how the doses will get to them.

To be fair, even if you’ve been paying close attention, there’s room to get lost.

“This is a massive vaccine distribution unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetime. It requires extraordinary logistical planning and collaboration between multiple state agencies, local public health agencies, community partners and providers,” said the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

Yes, eventually you will be able to get a free vaccine.

Yes, thousands of doses are arriving each week from the federal government.

Those numbers aren't constant and depend entirely on federal supply. More are on the way, and new vaccines are in development, but right now there’s not nearly enough to meet demand. Doses are only being made available to certain people, through certain health care providers.

Still, more than a month after Colorado began vaccinating its highest risk Phase 1A front-line workers, the largest-scale emergency inoculation program in generations appears to be hitting a stride. But not everywhere, not yet for everyone, and only after some eligible people say they’d spent weeks trying to get appointments using online portals that crashed or didn’t appear to be designed to accept their registration in the first place.

Colorado Springs psychiatrist John Fleming said he and his staff spent much of January — and one nurse spent a whole day on the phone — trying to get an appointment, or on a waiting list through Kaiser, the community partner vaccine provider he was directed to use. They repeatedly hit dead ends, were put on hold, only to reach someone who couldn’t provide an answer.

“As a small office with only a part-time secretary and direct care staff and myself totally busy taking care of patients I actually cannot devote a huge amount of time trying to figure this out,” said Fleming. He sought vaccines for the members of his staff who come into close contact with patients daily, during procedures such as drawing blood, and thereby qualify as high-risk under the vaccine criteria.

Late Friday afternoon, Fleming logged on to find an updated webpage and portal that worked as promised.

“I swear this was not there before. Maybe the passage of time is allowing systems to get caught up,” he said. “I am afraid that what is happening is that it’s ‘fire, then aim, then ready,’ instead of get ready, implement what is needed, then announce.”

As of Friday, just over 6% of Coloradans had received at least the first dose of the two-dose vaccines manufactured by either Pfizer or Moderna, among the higher rates being reported nationwide. While the state continues to vaccinate its Phase 1A candidates, it’s also begun vaccinating the first half of Phase 1B, Coloradans ages 70 and up, with a goal of vaccinating 70% of that population by Feb. 28.

Not everyone’s experience has been, or will be, the same. Even if they fall within the same high-risk group. Even if they’re neighbors.

In some cases, it’s simply an issue of first come, first served. In others, it’s a bit more complicated.

Allocations of the vaccine come to the state, and the CDPHE’s Joint Vaccination Task Force, from the federal level through Operation Warp Speed, with the amount based on population. Colorado’s residents make up 1.69% of the U.S., so it receives less than 2% of the vaccines available each week from Pfizer and now Moderna, which both received FDA emergency use authorization late last year.

“That equates to between 60,000 and sometimes 80,000 doses per week that we are allocated to the state of Colorado,” said Lisa Powell, manager of the Emergency Preparedness and Response Program for El Paso County Public Health. (A full course of the vaccine is two doses, with a recommended spacing of at least 21 days apart for the Pfizer version and 28 for Moderna.)

From there, the state uses an allocation table to decide how many doses go where.

Ten percent of the statewide distribution stays with CDPHE, and goes to support equity initiatives.

Sixty percent goes to large hospital systems. In El Paso County, those are Centura Health and UCHealth, Powell explained.

Fifteen percent goes to federally qualified health systems, such as Peak Vista, and another 15% to local public health departments, which then get the doses out via community partners, including UCHealth, Centura Health, Kaiser Permanente and Matthews-Vu Medical Group (see a full list of providers online at elpasocountyhealth.org) primarily through clinics.

“Those entities were chosen because they filled out applications for the Centers for Disease Control to be what we are calling a Phase 1 provider. That means they made agreements to allocate vaccines to our community in a fair and equitable manner and they are able to maintain the quality of the vaccine as it comes in,” Powell said.

You don't have to be a patient of any of the health care systems administering vaccines to get on the list for an appointment, so long as you qualify under the current phase. You will, however, need to register and provide contact information to get an appointment, which could come in days or possibly weeks, depending on where you fall in the queue.

""It may appear that some people are finding it easier to get the vaccine than others. I think that some of the confusion is that on the website, it says we are vaccinating our patients. What’s not very clear is once you sign up through their portal, then you are considered a patient and everyone has the same equal opportunity to receive the vaccine,"" Powell said.

Evans Army Community Hospital on Fort Carson and the VA get their vaccines from different sources at the federal level than CDPHE.

Evans' are coordinated through the Army Medical Materiel Agency and the Defense Health Agency. The hospital won't release numbers of doses administered, due to security concerns, but said in a tweet Friday that the hospital received its first doses of Moderna vaccine in late December. It's currently vaccinating national critical capabilities and personnel preparing to deploy to locations outside of the continental U.S.

Once prioritized groups at Fort Carson have the chance to get the vaccine, availability will be opened to Tricare beneficiaries and other eligible Department of Defense populations, according to the hospital.

The Department of Veterans Affairs is currently only offering the vaccine to members over 75.

In the VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System, vaccine appointments were opened to veterans who met the criteria several weeks ago at the Rocky Mountain Regional Medical Center in Aurora, among the first wave of national VA vaccination locations, in part, because it can safely maintain the Pfizer vaccine at the ultra-cold temperatures required.

Qualifying veterans began receiving the Pfizer vaccine at the Springs’ Floyd K. Lindstrom Clinic Jan. 16, and then in Burlington.

Receipt of the more portable Moderna vaccine, which doesn’t require such extreme cold, meant appointment-only VA vaccine clinics began last week in Lamar, La Junta, Salida, Alamosa and, on Saturday, in Pueblo.

Getting the doses of vaccine, and getting them into the arms that need it the most, is still only part of the challenge. For a health care system that covers 44,000 square miles, much of it rural, and includes aging veterans who maybe don't get their news in real time, clearing up confusion means turning to more traditional forms of outreach. Town halls (virtual), landline calls, and letters with a stamp.

""We're trying to get concise, important, up-to-date information out as often as we can ... as best we can, in a lot of different modes and venues,"" said the region's acting assistant director David Brazeau. ""Because there's a lot of information out there and sometimes there's a lot of misinformation, or information they don't really understand.""","More than half of Americans are confused about vaccine info, study finds",gazette.com

630,631,https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/politics/supporters-words-may-haunt-trump-at-impeachment-trial/2421127/,"The words of Donald Trump supporters who are accused of participating in the deadly U.S. Capitol riot may end up being used against him in his Senate impeachment trial as he faces the charge of inciting a violent insurrection.

At least five supporters facing federal charges have suggested they were taking orders from the then-presidentwhen they marched on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6 to challenge the certification of Joe Biden's election win. But now those comments, captured in interviews with reporters and federal agents, are likely to take center stage as Democrats lay out their case. It's the first time a former president will face such charges after leaving office.

“I feel like I was basically following my president. I was following what we were called to do. He asked us to fly there. He asked us to be there,"" Jenna Ryan, a Texas real estate agent who posted a photo on Twitter of herself flashing a peace sign next to a broken Capitol window, told a Dallas-Fort Worth TV station.

Jacob Chansley, the Arizona man photographed on the dais in the Senate who was shirtless and wore face paint and a furry hat with horns, has similarly pointed a finger at Trump.

Chansley called the FBI the day after the insurrection and told agents he traveled “at the request of the president that all ‘patriots’ come to D.C. on January 6, 2021,” authorities wrote in court papers.

Chanley’s lawyer unsuccessfully lobbied for a pardon for his client before Trump's term ended, saying Chansley “felt like he was answering the call of our president.” Authorities say that while up on the dais in the Senate chamber, Chansley wrote a threatening note to then-Vice President Mike Pence that said: “It’s only a matter of time, justice is coming.”

Trump is the first president to be twice impeached and the first to face a trial after leaving office. The charge this time is “inciting violence against the government of the United States.” His impeachment lawyer, Butch Bowers, did not respond to call for comment.

Opening arguments in the trial will begin the week of Feb. 8. House Democrats who voted to impeach Trump last week for inciting the storming of the Capitol say a full reckoning is necessary before the country — and the Congress — can move on.

For weeks, Trump rallied his supporters against the election outcome and urged them to come to the Capitol on Jan. 6 to rage against Biden's win. Trump spoke to the crowd near the White House shortly before they marched along Pennsylvania Avenue to Capitol Hill.

“We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn’t happen,” Trump said. “You don’t concede when there’s theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore.”

Later he said: “If you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore.” He told supporters to walk to the Capitol to “peacefully and patriotically” make your voices heard.

Trump has taken no responsibility for his part in fomenting the violence, saying days after the attack: “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate.”

Unlike a criminal trial, where there are strict rules about what is and isn’t evidence, the Senate can consider anything it wishes. And if they can show that Trump’s words made a real impact, all the better, and scholars expect it in the trial.

""Bringing in those people's statements is part of proving that it would be at a minimum reasonable for a rational person to expect that if you said and did the things that Trump said and did, then they would be understood in precisely the way these people understood them,"" said Frank Bowman, a Constitutional law expert and law professor at University of Missouri.

A retired firefighter from Pennsylvania told a friend that that he traveled to Washington with a group of people and the group listened to Trump's speech and then “followed the President’s instructions” and went to the Capitol, an agent wrote in court papers. That man, Robert Sanford, is accused of throwing a fire extinguisher that hit three Capitol Police officers.

Another man, Robert Bauer of Kentucky, told FBI agents that “he marched to the U.S. Capitol because President Trump said to do so,” authorities wrote. His cousin, Edward Hemenway, from Virginia, told the FBI that he and Bauer headed toward the Capitol after Trump said “something about taking Pennsylvania Avenue.""

More than 130 people as of Friday were facing federal charges; prosecutors have promised that more cases — and more serious charges — are coming.

Most of those arrested so far are accused of crimes like unlawful entry and disorderly conduct, but prosecutors this week filed conspiracy charges against three self-described members of a paramilitary group who authorities say plotted the attack. A special group of prosecutors is examining whether to bring sedition charges, which carry up to 20 years in prison, against any of the rioters.

Two-thirds of the Senate is needed to convict. And while many Republicans — including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky— have condemned Trump's words, it remains unclear how many would vote to convict him.

“While the statements of those people kind of bolsters the House manager's case, I think that President Trump has benefited from a Republican Party that has not been willing to look at evidence,” said Michael Gerhardt, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who testified before the House Judiciary Committee during Trump's first impeachment hearings in 2019.

“They stood by him for the entire first impeachment proceeding, thinking that the phone call with the president of the Ukraine was perfect and I’m sure they will think that was a perfect speech too. There is nothing yet to suggest that they would think otherwise,"" Gerhardt said.",Supporters' Words May Haunt Trump at Impeachment Trial,www.nbcchicago.com
631,632,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/535547-man-pleads-guilty-to-charge-in-minneapolis-police-precinct-fire-during,"Two St. Paul, Minn., men have pleaded guilty to charges in a fire at a Minnesota police precinct during the George Floyd protests last May, according to the Department of Justice.

The men, 25-year-old Davon De-Andre Turner and Branden Michael Wolfe, 23, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit arson. Turner entered his plea on Friday, and Wolfe pleaded guilty on Dec. 22.

U.S. Attorney Erica H. MacDonald announced both pleas on Friday.

Wolfe's sentencing hearing is scheduled for April 22, while Turner's will take place on May 13.

Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct, was where the officers involved in Floyd's death worked at the time. Since then, the four law enforcement officials have been criminally charged, and Minneapolis has enacted changes to help create more officer accountability.

In late May, 2020, bystander footage posted on the internet showed former police officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck. Floyd said that he couldn't breathe during the incident, but Chauvin continued to hold his knee against his neck for several minutes. Floyd then became unresponsive and was pronounced dead shortly afterward.

His death ignited nationwide protests that lasted through the summer of 2020, including in the state of Minnesota.

Both Turner and Wolfe were among the crowd of protestors outside the precinct on the night of May 28, when the crowd began to chant ""Burn it down.""

After the fence erected around the precinct's perimeter was torn down, Turner, along with co-defendant Bryce Michael Williams, allegedly took an incendiary device into the station and started a fire. Shortly after, Wolfe pushed a barrel into a fire lit in a second location inside the precinct, which he admitted he did with the intent of accelerating the flames, a Department of Justice document states.

Williams and Dylan Shakespeare Robinson, another man who was allegedly involved, were previously charged for their roles.

Chauvin is facing murder and manslaughter charges, for which he is set to begin trial on March 8.

County commissioners approved a zoning change for Thrive Cannabis Marketplace’s potential location on Jan. 6. The planning commission voted Thursday to hold a public hearing on a request from Scott Matthews to rezone the existing Stateline Liquor Store in Jackpot. Both locations are along U.S. Highway 93, not far from the Idaho-Nevada border about 45 miles south of Twin Falls. Jackpot has suffered economically because of COVID-19 and is looking at marijuana sales to give the town a boost. County commissioners approved an ordinance in November allowing sales, despite opposition from Twin Falls County officials. Elko County’s senior planner, Corey Rice, told the planning commission this week that Matthews was “very confident he would obtain a license to sell cannabis.” Matthews owns a retail marijuana store in Oregon. His company is called 420ville. Matthews said in November he was working toward opening a marijuana dispensary at the liquor store, which he said was purchased with that in mind. The liquor store would become the cannabis outlet, and a new liquor store would be constructed.

Your membership makes our reporting possible. {{featured_button_text}} Thrive’s property is a few blocks farther from the Idaho border. Spence Property Group sought the rezoning of 20,678 square feet of land across from the Four Jacks hotel and casino property for Thrive, which would lease the site from Spence Property for a retail marijuana store. Thrive is based in Las Vegas. The question of whether both 420ville and Thrive could receive licenses from the state to sell recreation and medicinal marijuana in Jackpot may be up to the state’s new Cannabis Compliance Board, which delayed action into 2021, according to Matthews. The board was formed in July 2020 to take over regulation of the industry from the Nevada Department of Taxation. Thrive has a retail cannabis license for Carlin that could be switched to Jackpot. The county planning commission split on the rezoning on a 3-3 vote, and Rice said those voting against were voting because of their opposition to marijuana dispensaries rather on the merits of the zoning change itself. Barton’s Club 93, which is located closer to the Matthews site, opposed Thrive’s rezoning in advance of their appeal to Elko County Commissioners, according to a Dec. 14 letter from attorney Richard Barrows. “Let me be clear that Barton’s Club 93 supports a retail cannabis dispensary in Jackpot. In fact, I appeared on behalf of Barton’s at your earlier meeting and spoke in favor of passing the cannabis ordinance,” Barrows wrote.",Cannabis companies compete for sites in Jackpot,magicvalley.com

The Justice Department has charged a Texas man who participated in the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill riots and posted death threats on social media against Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a U.S. Capitol police officer.

Garrett A. Miller of Richardson, Texas now faces five criminal charges stemming from the Capitol insurrection including trespassing and making death threats after tweeting, “Assassinate AOC.”

According to CNN, Miller, 34, said that the officer who fatally shot a Donald Trump supporter during the attack “deserves to die. So it’s hunting season.”

Clint Broden, a lawyer for Miller, said on Saturday that Miller regrets his actions and issued a statement, saying, “He did it in support of former President Trump but regrets his actions. He has the support of his family, and a lot of the comments, as viewed in context, are really sort of misguided political hyperbole. Given the political divide these days, there is a lot of hyperbole.”

The Associated Press reported that Miller shared a photo of himself in a “Make America Great Again” hat while inside the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “Just want to incriminate myself a little lol.”

According to documents from the Department of Justice, Miller said on Instagram that he “had a rope in [his] bag on that day.”

CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider shared a clip of Ocasio-Cortez retelling the story of how she and her colleagues “narrowly escaped death” as they escaped from violent protestors in the Senate Chambers.

“I had a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die,” Ocasio-Cortez said in the video on Jan. 13.

She added, saying, “It is not an exaggeration to say that many, many members of the House were nearly assassinated. It’s just not an exaggeration to say that at all and we were very lucky that things happened within certain minutes that allowed members to escape the Capitol unharmed.”

In a CNN interview with Chris Cuomo on Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez said that she and colleagues still don’t feel comfortable around certain members of Congress.

“You really think that colleagues of yours in Congress may do you dirty?” Cuomo asked.

She responded, “Yeah, well, one just tried to bring a gun on the floor of the House today — I believe it was Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland. There are separate House rules that prohibit the bringing in of firearms.”

637,638,https://island.lk/tastes-and-flavours-from-around-the-world/,"I recall meeting Imran Khan, the former cricketer after his victory of the World Cup during his visit to Sri Lanka, a few years ago. I met him whilst he was here on an invitation extended by the Chairman of Sifani Jevellers Shaabdeen The young cricketer at that time appeared so much more reserved. circumspect and formal. Handsome indeed, Imran Khan was the cynosure of all eyes among the women at that function.

Last week he was in Sri Lanka as the Prime Minister of Pakistan on an official visit on the invitation extended by the PM Mahinda Rajapakse and President of Sri Lanka Gothabaya Rajapakse..

During the interview, at that time he spoke with disarming candour about the many twists and turns of his life journey as a cricketer . Even at that time, he was adored by millions of fans,His charismatic personality was admired by many in the cricketing field where he was famous for his blistering bowling. He also spoke about his greatest success as a fund-raiser, establishing the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and research centre in 1996 and a college in 2008 with funds raised.

He was recognised as a great ,cricketer, a compassionate philanthropist, his charismatic personality is recognised, well beyond the borders of Pakistan. Meeting the former Captain of the Pakistan cricket team who defeated England in 1992 at the World Cup final is still etched in my memory.

Imran’s was raised in an upper middle class family with an engineer father and home maker mother. He did not pursue politics as a career until his late 40s. Before politics his passion was international cricket. An iconic cricketer. Khan dominated the cricketing World in the 1980s and 1990s. Oxford educated. he spent most of his time overseas. He was well liked figure in Pakistan, due to his boyish charm and sportsmanship. To millions of Pakistanis, Khan was their leader who led the nation to victory.

Today Imran’s journey to the corridors of Parliament was very interesting. He is articule, and used his voice for people’s issues. He increasingly asserted that his decision to enter politics was for the people not for fame, money or power. The huge fan following that Imran amassed were the urban younger citizens. His fiery speeches, his leadership skills for dealing with some of the contentions issues are remarkable. He saw a political vacuum in the theoretical state of Pakistan and made all efforts to make it a better alternative to the existing system after he took over power as the Prime Minister.

He arrived in Sri Lanka for a two day official visit, this Colombo trip was only Imran’s second foray since becoming PM.Imran Khan is the first head of state since the pandemic to visit Sri Lanka. During his two day stay he had many fruitful bilateral meetings with the higher officials in Sri Lanka.

The attention and the warmth showered on Imran Khan marks a definite turn in the relationship between Sri Lanka and Pakistan

The exuberant welcome Imran recieved in Sri Lanka reflects the love, the people and the cricket fans had for him. Billboards and flags ffluttered along the routes and within the city of Colombo focussed the cordial welcome.

In Sri Lanka ,his speeches reflected the oratorical skiis. His ability to entice enthuiastic and spontaneous responses that sesulted in standing ovation at the few meetings he chaired. His eloquent language of English with a Britist aacent, well known and admired by many.

His ability to project to thousands of people , without effacing their differenes make him not only a rare and articulate politician, but an outstanding Prime Minister. Meanwhile a press release from .Sthe embassy of Pakistan stated

The charismatic captain led Pakistan to its World Cup victory in 1992. Mr Khan, struggled for years to turn popular support into electoral gains. He launched his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 1996. His party won the General Election 2018 and he became Prime Minister of Pakistan after a political struggle of 22 years.

Imran Khan’s economic vision for Pakistan is alluring. Khan is working hard to improve the lives of the poor. He promised a “new Pakistan” in the 2018 General Election. Imran made pledges with the nation for a uniform education system, launching of a health card scheme, elimination of corruption, improving the tax culture, self-sustainability of Pakistan, generating employment opportunities, strengthening of the federation, bringing reforms in police, boosting investment and tourism, strengthening agriculture sector by imposing an agriculture emergency, and protecting women population. He is on right track to fulfill his promises with the nation.

The Government of Prime Minister Imran Khan has handled the economic impact of pandemic with effective strategies and emerged successful during tough times. Year 2020 has known to be a tale of challenges globally, but for Pakistan, under the leadership of PM Imran Khan, it has proved as a “story of success and development” even during the coronavirus pandemic.

Year 2020 narrates a journey of stable economy, numerous development and welfare projects, and remarkable achievements at foreign policy front. Khan’s government has significant achieved major milestones during 2020 along with a set of the Prime Minister’s New Year resolutions for year 2021.

Khan is not only achieving at domestic front but also fighting for the betterment of globe. Prime Minister Imran Khan, in his address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) 75th session, highlighted global issues including climate change, money laundering, pandemic, Islamophobia and human rights violations. He called upon the UN to play its role to combat racism and ensure implementation of its own resolution for global peace and stability.

Imran khan is a philanthropist. He is gifted with natural leadership and the capacity to accumulate great wealth. He has great talent for management in all walks of life, especially in business and financial matters, where he contributes the greater vision, purpose, and long-range goals. He understands the material world, and intuitively knows what makes virtually any enterprise work. Business, finance, real estate, law, science, publishing, and the management of large institutions are among the vocational fields that suit Imran best. He is naturally attracted to positions of influence and leadership, politics, social work, and teaching are among the many other areas where his abilities are shining.

PM Imran Khan’s political struggle of twenty two years can be compared with a thrilling test cricket match, full of twists and turns. After a long struggle, he succeeded in the 2018 General Election. PM Imran Khan’s Government has managed to perform well in the foreign affairs arena as well. Critical in this regard has been Khan’s personal charisma on the international stage and close coordination with the country’s all institutions.

During the 1990s, Khan also served as UNICEF’s Special Representative for Sports and promoted health and immunization programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. While in London, he also works with the Lord’s Taverners, a cricket charity. After retirement from cricket and before joining politics Khan focused his efforts solely on social work. By early nineties, he had founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust, a charity organisation bearing the name of his mother, Mrs. Shaukat Khanum. As the Trust’s maiden endeavour, Khan established Pakistan’s first and only cancer hospital, constructed using donations and funds exceeding $25 million, raised by Khan from all over the world.

Khan also established a technical college in the Mianwali District during April 2018 called Namal College. It was built by the Mianwali Development Trust (MDT), and is an associate college of the University of Bradford. Imran Khan Foundation is another welfare work, which aims to assist needy people all over Pakistan. It has provided help to flood victims in Pakistan.

President Rajapaksa is familiar with Pakistan where he attended number of military courses in Pakistan military training institutions. While Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has also deep association with Pakistan. Imran khan has visited Sri Lanka on number of occasions and has a great fan following in the Island Country. The upcoming visit of Prime Minister Khan will be a great opportunity for leaders of both countries to make bilateral relations meaningful and beneficial for people of Sri Lanka and Pakistan which would further strengthen the relations between the two friendly nations.",Tastes and flavours from around the world,island.lk

And if Sarah, the wife of one of the suicide bombers, herself had fled to India, who would have helped her? Answers to those questions should have been found, Environment Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.

Amaraweera yesterday said that the SLFP, therefore, rejected the report by the PCoI that probed the Easter Sunday carnage.

He said that from the beginning media had reported the evidence led before the Commission about advance intelligence available about the pending attacks that Zahran was going to carry out. But in the end, it was former President Maithripala Sirisena and Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera of the Bodu Bala Sena who were blamed for the attack.

It was President Sirisena who appointed the commission to find out the truth about the attacks. “The desired objectives have been achieved. I think even His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, the Archbishop, will not accept this report. He has not yet expressed his opinion in this regard,” Amaraweera said, adding that the SLFP wanted to know who had handled Zahran. “The other issue is that who brought 6,000 swords into the country. Those are the issues that came up following the Easter Sunday carnage. But it should be revealed why they have been ignored. Therefore, we are focusing on future steps in this regard.”

The people of the country did not expect such a report from the commission appointed to probe the Easter Sunday carnage, he said.

Amaraweera said: “I am not commenting on the Commission or the judiciary. But we, as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, are deploying a team of our lawyers to conduct a full study in this regard”

Amaraweera said female suicide cadres had also been trained and they had taken an oath before Zahran. The presidential commission had not made any revelations about this aspect of the issue, he added.

“The people wanted to know who was behind the Easter Sunday carnage, but the report does not say anything about it. This is one of the reasons why we have rejected the report.”",Pathfinder and Asia Society co-host Sri Lanka – US dialogue,island.lk
639,640,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas_legislature/article/Lt-Gov-Dan-Patrick-calls-for-changes-to-ease-15890539.php,"Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick is pushing the state to refine its criteria for COVID-19 vaccination eligibility, saying that whittling down the list may better prioritize vulnerable Texans and clear up confusion over when shots will actually be available.

The state is currently offering the vaccine to frontline workers and vulnerable Texans, a group of more than 9 million people — even though the state is only receiving about 300,000 doses a week. That numerical reality has made for a confusing and frustrating process for Texans eligible for a shot, with many unable to find available doses or unsure where to look with demand far exceeding supply.

“Texans need to have a better understanding of the time it will take for everyone to be vaccinated in order to reduce lines, confusion and frustration,” Patrick wrote in a Thursday letter to the state’s Expert Vaccination Allocation Panel.

It will probably be May at the earliest before all members of that first priority group have been immunized, said Dr. David Lakey, a member of the state’s vaccine panel, in an interview this week with Hearst Newspapers. The Texans currently eligible are included in groups 1A — health care workers and nursing home residents — and 1B, those over 65 and anyone 16 or older with certain pre-existing medical conditions.

Public health experts interviewed on Friday agreed that Patrick’s suggestion could alleviate anxiety over vaccination availability and help get doses into the arms of people who need it most. So far, Texas has administered more than 1.5 million vaccine doses — a number that leads much of the nation but also signals the long road ahead for a state of 29 million people.

“Simple math makes it clear it will take us several months to vaccinate the current priority population,” Patrick said in the letter, which was first reported by the Texas Tribune.

Patrick suggested creating subgroups within 1B over the next several weeks — perhaps by first taking two weeks to vaccinate those 75 and older, a group of about 1.5 million. Then, he said, a subgroup of roughly 65,000 teachers and school staff over 65 could become eligible.

“This would help give people an idea of reasonable expectations and reduce wait times and frustration each week,” Patrick wrote. “Right now, in many cities and counties when an announcement of available vaccinations is made, website sign-up pages crash and phone calls go unanswered.”

On Friday, the Houston Health Department announced 1,600 new vaccine appointment slots. They were filled within five minutes.

It’s not immediately clear whether Gov. Greg Abbott and the Department of State Health Services will heed Patrick’s advice. A spokeswoman for the health agency said the vaccination allocation panel would likely discuss the issue at its next meeting on Monday, which is not open to the public.

Abbott also has not weighed in on the matter; a spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

A smooth vaccine distribution is crucial for Texas, where coronavirus infections have soared in recent weeks. COVID-19 has claimed more than 33,000 lives in the Lone Star State, and nearly 14,000 Texans were hospitalized with the virus as of Friday.

Marilyn Felkner, a clinical assistant professor in public health at the University of Texas at Austin, said people would be willing to wait more patiently for a vaccine if they had a better idea of how long it would take to get an appointment.

“There are so many people in that group expecting that they can get the vaccine quickly, and that has created an unrealistic expectation,” she said.

She also endorsed the idea of starting with individuals 75 and older, aligning with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s guidance gives first priority to health care employees and nursing home residents, followed by anyone at least 75 years old and frontline essential workers, including grocery store workers, mailmen, police officers and teachers.

Texas chose to assign different priority groups. While the state also started with health care workers and nursing home residents, officials abruptly opened up vaccination appointments for Texans with comorbidities and senior citizens in late December. The move came as state officials worried that providers were leaving vaccines on shelves because they could not find enough members of the first group to inoculate.

If Texas does further refine its priority vaccine recipients, essential workers who are also senior citizens could move up the list, said Shaun Truelove, an assistant scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. State officials could start by vaccinating Texas’ most elderly residents, and then move on to those 65 and older who work in schools, grocery stores or public service jobs, he said.

“Something’s to be said about these frontline workers, too,” Truelove said. “We talk about them, and we’re all relying on them, but they get ignored.”

And while the shift to subgroups after weeks of allowing all members of Group 1B to register may cause confusion “for some people,” he said, most Texans would be able to adapt quickly. Then, state officials would have to confront to a new challenge: ensuring the subgroups are still large enough to ensure no vaccines go unused.

“It has the potential to slow it down further,” Truelove said — but when instituted appropriately, prioritizing the most vulnerable groups can significantly reduce hospitalization rates and fatalities.",Lt.

In his place, a range of new presenters and programmes as the Bauer service introduces a new ‘Spring schedule’. There are new slots for Melissa Riddell, Katharine Walker, DJ Hix, and Owen Beers.

Fashion blogger Melissa Riddell will take over the weekend breakfast slot (6-10am).

Melissa started her time at Cool FM in 2017 through the ‘Cool Choices’ programme – a scheme designed to offer work experience in the media industry to young people aged 16 to 24.

Former Miss Northern Ireland, Katharine Walker starts her own show, having been part of the Cool Saturday Show with Stuart Robinson and Deputy Dave.

Katharine, from Hillsborough, combines her broadcasting work with her full-time job as a nurse, and will now be presenting during weekend late nights – including the station’s love song hour ‘Cool Goes Quiet’ after 11pm.

The new line-up includes the first show to be simulcast between Cool FM and Downtown Radio, with the Top 40 Sunday chart show – specifically tailored to Northern Ireland. NI Hit 40 will be presented by DJ Hix and counts down NI’s biggest 40 songs of the week based on downloads, streams and tags, making sure listeners are hearing their favourite tunes.

Completing Cool FM’s new spring schedule is Owen Beers who is taking over the extended classics show ‘The Cool Years’ on Sunday mornings from 10am-1pm, which celebrates music from the 90s and 00s.

Bauer Media Group – Northern Ireland Managing Director David Tighe commented: “We’re thrilled to unveil this stellar line-up of presenters for our exciting new Spring schedule on Cool FM.

“As Northern Ireland’s biggest commercial radio station, Cool FM is constantly looking for new ways to reinvigorate our schedules, as part of our commitment to deliver the freshest in new music and programming for our listeners across the country. It’s great to see more young women like Melissa and Katharine taking over the airwaves and becoming established voices on our radios, and on the NI media scene.”

Melissa added: :“Radio has been so important over the past 12 months, as a source of both companionship and much-needed relief to so many. Katharine and I are so proud to be fronting these popular shows and extremely grateful to Bauer for the opportunity – we can’t wait to be part of new-look weekends at Cool FM!”

Depending on the outlet, the goal is too ambitious, or too modest, or doable but difficult, or already stirring disagreements within Biden’s pandemic response team.

Only one thing is indisputable: Time will tell. April 30 will mark 100 days since Biden was inaugurated, but well before that, it should be clear whether the new administration is on track to fix the chaotic, lagging vaccination rollout it inherited.

Even if that 100-day goal is achieved, it will be only the beginning. Experts estimate that 60% to 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated to extinguish the spread of the coronavirus. Anthony Fauci, who is being retained by Biden as the government’s top infectious disease adviser, recently raised his estimate to 80% to 90%. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 death toll is 410,000 and counting.

Meanwhile, Zurab Pololikashvili, the secretary general of the United Nations World Tourism Organization, called this week for the global adoption of vaccination passports as part of wider measures he said were essential to get the world in motion once again.

""The rollout of vaccines is a step in the right direction, but the restart of tourism cannot wait,"" he told a meeting of the UNWTO's Global Tourism Crisis Committee in Madrid.

Some 25,000 Guard and active-duty troops were deployed in and around the city ahead of Biden’s inaugural as officials claimed they were concerned about riots like the one involving mostly supporters of former President Donald Trump.

But the anticipated violence did not materialize, so it’s not clear why the National Guard is looking for roughly 7,000 troops to volunteer to remain in the nation’s capital unless federal officials believe the threat of new violence remains.

Military.com, which first reported the deployment extension request, noted that Guard troops have remained in Washington, D.C., to support requests from the U.S. Secret Service and other federal law enforcement. Officials said that around 7,000 troops would remain deployed in the city through the end of January.

But a Guard Bureau official told the outlet that planning for at least that many troops to stay in D.C. for another two months is currently ongoing.

Guard Bureau spokesperson Nahaku McFadden said that Guard members who remain past the initial 31-day mobilization order will be on a volunteer basis.

“We are not going to make anybody stay,” McFadden said.

National Guard officials also noted that no troops deployed in Washington or across the country on Inauguration Day faced any threats, Military.com reported.

“We not only had 26,000 here in D.C., but there were also 7,000 supporting 30 state capitals around the country,” Air Force Maj. Gen. Steven Nordhaus, director of Domestic Operations and Force Development for the National Guard Bureau, told the outlet.

“There were no incidents that I know of. … It was really remarkable with our states working with their local law enforcement. It was very peaceful, thanks to all the great efforts from the states and the National Guard in each of those states,” he added.

That said, the number of potential volunteers is likely to be less than the initial group of soldiers deployed to the capital after what appears to be the first scandal of the Biden administration.

On Friday, lawmakers from both parties were outraged after Capitol Police reportedly instructed troops to vacate the Capitol Building and redeploy into a nearby parking garage as temperatures in the city dipped into the 30s. The move created a significant political backlash in D.C. as well as from state governors who responded by ordering their contingents back home.

“Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer—why are American troops who are tasked with keeping security at the Capitol being forced to sleep in a parking lot? They deserve to be treated with respect, and we deserve answers,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) tweeted.

“If this is true, it’s outrageous,” Schumer (D-N.Y.) responded. “I will get to the bottom of this.”

Fox News went on to add: “Also condemning the situation were Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va.; Tom Cotton, R-Ark.; Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.; John Boozman, R-Ark.; and Maggie, Hassan, D-N.H., among other senators, and a litany of House members.”

In addition, the decision to deploy thousands of troops in such close quarters also has contributed to the spread of COVID-19 among the ranks, Politico reported Friday, as hundreds have tested positive for the virus since being deployed.

“Ideally, these guys should all be in hotels. When they’re taking rest time, they should be taking it outside the campus with an ability to be separated and socially distanced,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told the outlet. “Ultimately we’ve got to make sure that they’re not taking their extended rest time on campus, that they’re in hotel rooms.”

The outlet noted the problem was compounded after troops were ordered to mass in parking garages.

Murphy also hinted that military deployments in the Capitol Complex were likely to be ongoing.

“I think we’ve got to figure out what went wrong because I think there’s going to be a National Guard presence on campus for the foreseeable future,” he said.","National Guard asking 7,000 troops to voluntarily stay behind in DC until late March",www.bizpacreview.com

Beijing insists it has sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea with its claim overlapping with those from six other countries. Tensions could rise significantly after China passed its new Coast Guard Law on Friday.

This allows Chinese coastguard to “take all necessary measures, including the use of weapons when national sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdictions are being illegally infringed by foreign organisations or individuals at sea”. The legislation gives the coast guard the power to demolish foreign built structures on reefs claimed by China. It explains the circumstances in which different types of weaponry - handheld, shipborne or airborne - can be deployed. Beijing regularly sends its coast guard to push foreign fishing ships away from the South China Sea, with several having been sunk in the process.

China also claims sovereignty over a number of islands in the East China Sea which are currently controlled by Japan. The United States, and a number of other western powers, dispute Beijing’s claims and regularly send warships on “freedom of navigation” patrols through the South China Sea. The new legislation increases the risk one of these could result in armed confrontation with Chinese vessels. Speaking to CNN Christian Le Miere, an expert in maritime diplomacy, warned the new legislation “strikes at the heart” of American support for freedom of navigation in the area.

He added: “China’s coast guard is already doing most of the heavy lifting in maritime coercion in the near seas, so it’s worth examining the new legislation just passed on this issue.” Beijing has been building up its military presence in the South China Sea over the past few years building bases, including airstrips, on natural and artificial islands. As well as being the world’s busiest shipping lane the South China Sea holds considerable undersea natural gas and oil deposits. China merged a number of maritime police agencies, under the control of the People’s Armed Forces, to create its coast guard force.",South China Sea: War fears EXPLODE as new Beijing law allows open fire on foreign ships,www.express.co.uk

China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, has routinely had one or two reconnaissance aircraft fly over the area in recent months. On Saturday, however, eight nuclear-capable bombers and four fighter jets flew over the waters between the southern part of Taiwan and the Pratas Islands in the South China Sea.

In a statement, the ministry said it responded with airborne sorties, radio warnings and ""air defense missile systems deployed to monitor the activity.""

China, which did not immediately comment on Saturday's developments, has said it has been conducting exercises to defend Taiwan's sovereignty and security.

The entry of China's military aircraft into Taiwan's defense identification zone comes three days after Joe Biden assumed the U.S. presidency, following his defeat of Donald Trump.

In April of 1968, as a junior officer in the Army, I was among those ordered hurriedly to assist the Illinois National Guard in staunching the rioting on Chicago’s West Side, which was literally ablaze in the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Surreal. In August of that fateful year, thousands of Vietnam War protesters stormed Chicago. They set upon provoking violence, successfully, from Chicago cops who occupied a different world from the long-haired, liberal provocateurs. Indeed, Days of Rage. A major difference, to me anyway, between those violent episodes and the recent assault on our U.S. Capitol is that the grievances back then were clear. Today, nobody seems sure why. I suggest the following as among the underlying resentments of those who protest the present state of our union, whether violence prone or not so:
• The rise of minorities and women; the latter are now far exceeding men in educational achievement. Until recently, white males had both groups under their thumbs.
• Rising income inequality. Since 1966, average family income for those in the bottom two-fifths of the nation has been flat, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In contrast, income for the top fifth has more than doubled, from 7 times to 14 times more than those in the bottom fifth.
• Rural America is generally struggling, indeed hurting. Many who live in this “flyover country” like their laid-back, small-town way of life, and don’t want to leave. Yet they sense they are also being left behind by those in the plugged-in big cities.
• Many who are struggling economically may feel a sense of guilt that they coulda/shoulda done better in school. But we humans can’t blame ourselves, so we project our shortcomings onto others. Over the past century and beyond, blame was pinned onto international bankers. Now, it’s the elites, they feel, who are trying to lord over them.
• But the biggest factor in generating anger, or so I contend (with later research to confirm me or not), is the melee of intense, often provocative, sometimes violence-tinged information that comes via social media. The human brain craves information. The reptilian brain stem at the base of our heads is constantly scanning the horizon for threats and opportunities, that is, information. That is what has kept us alive. In the center of our squishy, grapefruit-size brain is our limbic system, which for jillions of years has been mediating our emotions and such as our flight-or-fight decisions. At the front of our brain is the frontal cortex, the thinking part of our noggin, which has been developing over more recent millions of years. The frontal cortex, the various parts of the limbic system and the reptilian brain stem are all in constant communication, neurons caroming hither and yon. The frontal cortex advises the limbic system, you might say, but the latter often ultimately controls our decisions.

What to do? The following is tentative and insufficient, needing much more reflection.
• Freedom of speech is cherished, central to our being as a nation. Yet it has been regulated in the past, via what was called the Fairness Doctrine. In force from 1949 to 1985, the doctrine required that broadcasters present “contrasting viewpoints.” Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms have become, given their incredible popularity, like broadcasters, in the public interest. So, maybe something along the lines of a fairness doctrine for social media programming that is focused on political discourse.
• We need to beef up civics education from grammar school through post-high school programs. The apparent ignorance of the rule of law and democratic processes reflected in much discourse I see and hear is deeply troubling.

650,651,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Will-Venezuela-Go-To-War-Over-Oil.html,"January 2021 is still far from over yet the pages of Oilprice already boast 6 articles about Guyana being the hottest drilling spot in the world. This is hardly surprising, considering the hot streak that ExxonMobil had over the past 5 years, with new companies coming in and stepping up the drilling game. The interest globally attributed to Guyana has aggravated Venezuela’s long-standing grievances over the disputed Essequibo province – before 2015 the Venezuela vs Guyana oil standoff was akin to a David vs Goliath story but now, with Guyana building up its oil reserves tally and continuing to attract new investors, the balance has become a lot more nuanced. Amidst all of this, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has pledged to reconquer Essequibo. At first glance, the proposition that Venezuela should go to war over a disputed territory, let alone with Guyana, seems rather dubious. Venezuela boasts the world’s largest proven oil reserves, totalling roughly 304 Bbbls (see Graph 1), i.e. more than all of North America combined, more than Iraq and Iran combined. Guyana’s reserves are a fraction of that, barely reaching 3% with its 9-10 Bbbls. However, behind the dry facade of data and statistics, there lies an entire universe of human emotions, oftentimes led astray due to their subjective nature and in this particular realm, Caracas is the one frustrated and concerned. Guyana is adding one major discovery after another (the recent failure of Hassa-1 notwithstanding), whilst the Venezuelan national oil company PDVSA keeps on struggling to make ends meet.

The dispute over Guayana Esequiba (alternatively dubbed the Essequibo Region) is one of the most complex remaining, mixing colonial legacies with modern-day grievances. It all began in 1840 when the British Empire demarcated the heretofore undisputed and unsettled frontier between British Guiana and Venezuela, by means the “Schomburgk Line”. To no one’s surprise Venezuela rejected the British claim, however, unwilling as they were to get mired in a protracted conflict, both sides agreed to disagree in 1850 and vowed not to colonize the then-largely uninhabited region. Despite arbitrations and negotiations, the question of who should control the Essequibo Region remained unsolved by the time of Guyana declaring itself independent in 1966. Caracas recognized the independent Guyana, however only its territories located to the east of the Essequibo River, maintaining its claim that all the territories to the west are part of Venezuela.

One of the most protracted territorial disputes globally, the discovery of oil offshore Guyana might have been the factor missing to propel the issue forward. ExxonMobil, the operator of Guyana’s Stabroek offshore block, was subject to maritime harassment by the Venezuelan Navy and had one of its surveying vessels detained in 2013. However, when Exxon discovered the Liza field in 2015, closer to the Guyanese-Surinamese frontier and hence were beyond the Venezuelan maritime claim, the stakes turned really high. Guyana had official proof that its offshore was not sub-commercial as was previously thought (initially companies appraised the shallow waters of Guyana and found no commercial deposits) and with the help of a US major could now count on high-level backing for its border case.

With every new discovery on the Stabroek block, Venezuela’s opposition to Guyana taking the left bank of the Essequibo River was becoming increasingly untenable. Concurrently, the good neighbor relations of the Chavez era when Guyana was member to the continent-wide Petrocaribe movement and even participated in barter deals to satisfy its crude needs, went downhill fairly quickly. 

Yet there is another factor that most certainly contributed to Caracas now striking such a belligerent tone – US sanctions against Venezuela. Not only did the tightening of screws on President Maduro’s political allies and relatives blunt the political prospects of Juan Guaido, it also led to the entry of Venezuela’s military (that remained loyal to Maduro amidst the worst humanitarian suffering) into the Latin American country’s oil industry.

Any future US administration will most probably seek to safeguard ExxonMobil’s assets in Guyana. A first sign of this – in the first days of 2021 the commander of the US Southern Command arrived in Guyana for a 3-day visit, to celebrate the launch of joint US-Guyanese coast exercises. According to top-ranking officials in the Guyanese army, Georgetown is intent on fortifying its military ties with the United States, including but not limited to arms purchases. Concurrently, Venezuela formed a new parliament which will no longer be controlled by the Guiado-style opposition – the pro-Maduro National Assembly will inevitably become more aggressive in its narrative and overall behavior. Part of the aggression might result from the UN Court of Justice’s ongoing review of the Essequibo case, the decision of which was already declined by Caracas before its actual deliverance.

So, will there be a war between Venezuela and Guyana? Such a scenario seems unlikely now.

First, Maduro might wait to see what the new Biden Administration has to offer, how will it tackle the Venezuelan conundrum. Second, there is very little reason to heat up tensions now, when no final decision had been taken, the peak of confrontation should be around 2023/2024 when the ICJ is assumed to deliver its opinion on the legal status of the Essequibo Region. Third, even if the ICJ rules in favor of Guyana which seems quite likely, Venezuela remains unlikely to trigger a military response, for fear of actual US retaliation. It is one thing to foil an amateurish coup attempt by a private military company (Operation Gideon in May 2020), an altogether different one to deal directly with the US military.

Norway is the world leader in terms of EV adoption and sales penetration. 2019 was another big year, with nearly 13% YoY growth and 71% new PC sales penetration. EV sales in Norway crossed the 100K mark for the first time, getting closer to 100% penetration. The success of EVs is being driven by strong incentivization, which makes EVs more economical than ICE vehicles and a vast charging network.

The automotive industry is rapidly evolving in terms of technology and tackling environmental issues. Electric vehicles (EVs) have been introduced as a clean energy initiative as they have low or zero emissions and are becoming an integral part of the OEMs' business strategies. Automakers are creating separate EV business units to prepare for the expected EV boom in the future. However, the surge in EV demand will create a huge need for charging infrastructure and safety regulations and standards.

The EV market in Norway is highly advanced; in fact, the Government and regional administrative bodies have to contend with the backlash against the aggressive incentives affecting revenue streams due to high EV adoption rates. However, the incumbent Government remains resolute as EV incentives are a strong political stimulus.

2019 also saw the launch of the Tesla Model 3, which provided a boost to the already thriving BEV market. Norway has a surplus demand for EVs and imports secondhand EVs from neighboring countries. The used EV market represents almost 15% of the xEV car parc.

The charging infrastructure is well established and Norway is now looking to upgrade to faster charging and newer standards. The study provides a detailed analysis of the EV market scenario with charts based on annual sales (2019) and historical sales. PEVs and HEVs have separate sections.
• Historical annual sales, monthly sales for 2019, market penetration, and YoY growth from 2010 to 2019
• Market share by xEV type and sales share of each xEV type for the top 5 highest-selling OEMs since 2010

Dr. Vishal Chauhan, son of Indian immigrants, was working as a hospital doctor in the UK. Understanding that the Climate Crisis is a Health Crisis he makes a big sacrifice: he gives up his well-paid job as a doctor and his comfortable life to join the climate movement Extinction Rebellion. Together with his new friends he besieges the centre of London and a coal mine in the north of England. Radical system change is needed, Vishal says, and there is no time to lose: “We’ve got only one generation left to survive on this Earth.” Community is key in everything the movement proposes. But then COVID-19 hits the world … Will there be a future for all of us on Earth?

Non-violent civil disobedience is at the heart of Extinction Rebellion’s strategy to fight for change. Some Extinction Rebellion activists, including Vishal, have been trained in mindfulness and peaceful activism in Plum Village, France.

656,657,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/analysis/crops/so-much-for-upward-grain-price-momentum-analyst-says,"Well, so much for the upward momentum. This week we saw the entire grain complex get a major price wipeout, with most of the pressure coming on Friday.

For wheat, Chicago led the way down with a drop of 41¢, Kansas City dropped 30¢, and Minneapolis fell 31¢. Corn briefly touched limit down on Friday but did not find a lot of buying there as it closed just a penny off limit down, losing 31¢ on the week. Soybeans gave up a big chunk of their gains with a drop of $1.05.

Much of the selling was fund related, as the selling kept triggering more sell orders. Wheat ran into some fundamental selling as Russia decided not to impose export quotas, just keep the tariffs in place. In effect, if world prices rally to match Russian FOB offers, then Russian wheat is back in play as an export option.

It is highly unlikely, however, that the Russian government will allow wheat out of the country if farmers are still holding tight and domestic prices continue strong. The whole point of them imposing tariffs in the first place, after a record crop no less, was to stoke farmer selling.

We will see how that plays out. At some point, farmers will have to sell something as they prepare for the planting season. But with ample storage space and dry conditions for winter wheat, farmers fear a short crop this coming season and will likely hold as much as they can.

Bottom line for wheat, because of production shortfalls in Russia, Europe, Argentina, and to some extent Ukraine, most of the world’s biggest exporters have moved to the sidelines. Russia’s initial 25-euro/MT export tax ($.83/bu) quickly pushed world prices to the tariff level, making Russian wheat competitive again after only a week or so. The Russian government stepped in again by doubling the tariff; this will surely slow the exports. But with so little competition, world price will likely work its way to the new tariff level again.

To break this bull market requires good yields across the Northern Hemisphere this season. Not impossible, but dry conditions currently linger in key growing regions in the Black Sea and the U.S., so it is not a slam dunk, even with record Russian plantings and a decent-size jump in U.S. plantings.

Let’s not forget the major demand-driven bull markets in corn and soybeans, which is certainly helping to fuel the bull fire in wheat. This spring, farmers will plant fence row to fence row, weather permitting. They will focus on corn and beans, and I think spring wheat will get caught in the crossfire as the Dakotas and Minnesota look at more promising returns for the row crops than spring wheat. I look for Minneapolis to keep improving against Chicago.

Kansas City, too, will likely continue to gain against Chicago even though that spread has already had a very impressive run. Russia raises hard red winter wheat; thus, its absence would understandably support Kansas City. However, historically, the more liquid market has been Chicago, and the last Russian drought sent Chicago sharply higher. This time, even with the strength in corn and soybeans, Chicago wheat could not out-perform Kansas City. That says a lot about the underlying fundamentals in hard red winter wheat, and that the fund/speculative community is willing to trade big positions in Kansas City futures rather than migrating to the more liquid Chicago futures market.

So, while we’re getting a correction, I don’t think the bull market is over for any of the major grains. Demand is obviously not being rationed, and this break will only encourage more U.S. sales, further tightening the already very tight balance sheets in corn and beans. Sky-high world feed grain prices are pulling wheat into feed rations, threatening wheat supplies as well.

It might take a week or so for grain prices to stabilize, but the longer-term trend is still up.","So much for upward grain price momentum, analyst says",www.agriculture.com

Ninety years since the establishment of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), the national Party congress has always been a significant event marking a new period in the Southeast Asian country, it said.



It noted that the CPV, founded by President Ho Chi Minh in 1930, is still the force ensuring the success of peace building and the construction of an equal society, as well as the reinforcement of national security and defence.

Vinogradov expressed his belief that the upcoming 13th National Party Congress will create a strong impetus for Vietnam’s development towards modernisation, including growth in high technology.

He wrote that the draft documents submitted to the congress reflect the strategic vision and creative approach of the CPV as well as the detemination of the whole nation towards the goal of building a more prosperous country with happy people.

Vietnam has won great prestige in the international arena, he went on, which affirms the sound policies of the Party and the State in international integration and the country’s willingness to be a friend and trustworthy partner of all countries and a responsible member of the international community.

The article cited figures from international organisations and foreign media highlighting the outstanding achievements Vietnam has recorded in all fields since the 12th National Party Congress.

Russia, with its special sentiment towards Vietnam, keeps a close watch on the daily life of its close friend, he wrote.

In another continent, leading and prestigious newspapers in Algeria also run articles in recent weeks on the 13th National Party Congress in Vietnam.

The articles underscored the importance of the event for the country's national construction and development in the future while spotlighting its socio-economic, political, and diplomatic achievements over the years, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

El Moudjahid (War Veteran), a leading mainstream newspaper in Algeria, posted two articles regarding the congress. Both affirmed that this is a great event of historical significance, marking a new milestone in Vietnam’s development as well as the growth of the CPV.

It said the event will define the development orientations of the country and call on Vietnamese people to speed up the “Doi Moi” (reform) process, promote fast and sustainable development while sketching out major tasks and breakthroughs.

It noted that Vietnam has risen from a poor country to a middle-income country with political stability, strong economic development, and extensive international integration.

Under the leadership of the CPV, the country has successfully controlled COVID-19 and maintained economic growth, becoming one of only 10 countries in the world to post growth and among the 16 best newly-emerging economies in 2020.

Meanwhile, the Tribune-diplomatique newspaper highlighted that Vietnam has maintained external events and international integration in both direct and online forms, thus enhancing the country’s position in the global arena.

Vietnam successfully fulfilled the roles of ASEAN Chair in 2020, President of the 41st General Assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliament Assembly (AIPA), and non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in the 2020-21 tenure, it said.

With the goal of becoming a high-income developed country by 2045, the draft documents of the congress manifest the desire to build a prosperous, strong, rich, democratic, modern, and equal country, it stated./.VNA",Foreign media highlight significance of 13th National Party Congress to Vietnam,vietnamnet.vn

Police clashed violently with protesters in Moscow and arrested more than 2,500 in cities across the country Saturday as Russians took to the streets to denounce Kremlin rule and demand the release of Navalny.

""The United States strongly condemns the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists this weekend in cities throughout Russia,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.

Navalny being taken into custody and the arrests of his supporters were ""troubling indications of further restrictions on civil society and fundamental freedoms,"" he added.

""We call on Russian authorities to release all those detained for exercising their universal rights and for the immediate and unconditional release of Aleksey Navalny,"" Price said, using an alternative spelling.

""We urge Russia to fully cooperate with the international community's investigation into the poisoning of Aleksey Navalny and credibly explain the use of a chemical weapon on its soil.""

In Russia tens of thousands nationwide answered Navalny's call to rally, which he issued after he was detained at a Moscow airport on arrival from Germany, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal poisoning with a nerve agent.

Saturday's protests took on an unprecedented geographic scale, spanning more than 100 cities across the country. Previous large-scale opposition demonstrations in 2012 and 2019 were largely centered in Moscow.","US Condemns Russia's ""Use Of Harsh Tactics"" Against Navalny Supporters",www.ndtv.com

661,662,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/internet-shutdown-stalls-digital-campaigning-electoral-observers-say--3267028,"The recent shutdown of Internet by the government for five days during the presidential and parliament election greatly affected the voter digital campaigns and mobilization, the Citizens Coalition for Electoral Democracy in Uganda (CCEDU) has said.

Ms Charity Ahimbisibwe, the executive director of CCEDU, said most youth who are more than 65 per cent of Uganda’s population engage mostly on social media using different social media platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and Instagram.

“It is unfortunate that most youth who mainly use the internet for communication, and scores of others were greatly affected by the shutdown of the internet,” she said.

Addressing the press in Muyenga, Kampala, Ms Ahimbisibwe said many voters were left out after the shutdown. She said the “Mulembe Gwa Digito campaign” that CCEDU had launched in December, just 40 days to polling date was further hampered by the lockdown.

CCEDU developed a voter mobilization campaign dubbed Mulembe Gwa Digital, Beera Mu Class to engage the youth through ways that appeal to them.

The campaign is meant to hook the youth and women to the elections and encourage them to turn up to vote in big numbers.

Uganda Communications Commission ordered all telecommunication firms to shut down all social media platforms just a few hours before Ugandans headed to the polls on January 14 2021.

Ms Ahimbisibwe said since its launch in December they had managed to access about 1,000 youths from Makerere, Mukono, Gulu and Mbarara universities.

“We also mobilized through online and zoom meetings youths, students and hundreds of community members surrounding the universities where we held meetings.”

She described the voter turn-out as very dismal compared to the 2016 voter turnout. President Museveni, incumbent and the National Resistance Movement (NRM) Party candidate won for the sixth term with 5, 851,037 votes representing 58.64 per cent of the total votes cast.

National Unity Platform flag bearer, Robert Kyagulanyi Sentamu garnered 3, 475, 298 votes representing 34.83 per cent of the votes. A total of 11 presidential candidates took part in this year’s presidential elections.

Others were FDCs Patrick Oboi Amuriat, Norbert Mao (Democratic Party), Gen. Mugisha Muntu (Alliance for National Transformation), Gen. Henry Tumukunde (Independent) and Joseph Kabuleta.

Also in the race were Nancy Kalembe (Only lady in the race), John Katumba, Willy Mayambala, and Fred Mwesigye.

According to Justice Simon Byabakama, the Uganda Electoral Commission chairperson, a total of 9,978,093 Ugandans voted out of the registered 18.1 million voters.

CCEDU executive director said the fact that more than 7 million Ugandans didn’t or refused to vote shows that the civic and voter education is still lacking.

“As CCEDU we managed to traverse Busoga, Bukedi, Elgon, Teso, Karamoja, Mbarara, Acholi and Central Uganda, but the time of the UN Women supported Omulembe Gwa Digito wasn’t sufficient,” she said.

She said the three month project was started after reports emerged that the youth and women in Uganda have been marginalized, stereotyped and relegated to spectator positions in political activities.

“They (youth and women) have been stigmatized as ‘bandits and wrong doers’ during elections and political peak seasons and while this applies to male youth, the female youth have not been spared by sexist tendencies and being ‘closed out’ from key spaces for participation through fear, monetization and demobilization based on some gender dimensions like ones marital status among others,” she said.

She explained that the 2021 Electoral processes have seriously undermined the participation of young people who have largely been labeled as destructive.

The campaign is largely through technology, language and images (visual/audio). The campaign utilizes peer-to-peer communication across multi–media platforms to speak emotively and influence young people positively to appreciate, participate and engage in the 2021 elections.

Dr Miria Matembe, the CCEDU Board Chairperson urged the youth to stand out and embrace the Omulembe Gwa Digito describing it as a major tool in the prevention of the COVID19 pandemic.","Internet shutdown stalls digital campaigning, electoral observers say",www.monitor.co.ug

""A desperate fear of criminal indictment may even explain Trump's willingness to break any number of laws to stay in office despite losing his reelection bid, democracy and the Constitution be damned.""

While President Joe Biden is correct to pledge to stay out of prosecutorial decisions surrounding Trump, wrote Conway, the Justice Department should not — and everything from the Russia obstruction of justice, to the Ukraine bribery scheme, to his attacks on the election and incitement of the Capitol riot, should be on the table to prosecute.

One important avenue, wrote Conway, is to follow the lead of New York prosecutors.

""[Manhattan DA Cyrus] Vance is running a state investigation, but if Trump has committed bank or insurance fraud, that would be chargeable as federal offenses as well, including mail or wire fraud,"" wrote Conway. ""So, too, with state tax offenses, given how Trump's federal and state returns would no doubt track one another. Trump apparently had good reason to be concerned about who would fill [Preet] Bharara's old job.""

Also important, Conway argued, is for future Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel — or, ideally, more than one of them.

""With Trump, there's so much to investigate criminally that one special counsel can't do it all,"" wrote Conway. ""Could you imagine one prosecutor in charge of addressing Trump's finances and taxes, his hush-money payments, obstruction of the Mueller investigation, the Ukraine scandal, and post-election misconduct, for starters? It would be an impossible task for one team. One special counsel's office couldn't do it all, not in any reasonable amount of time, and it's important for prosecutors to finish their work as quickly as possible. Three or four special counsels are needed. Under the regulations, each would be accountable to the attorney general.""

The incident took place at around 11:30 a.m. Friday in the vicinity of Canal Street and Allen Street, the NYPD said. The men and women assaulted a 26-year-old man, took his cellphone, pants, underwear and shoes. During the assault, the individuals cut the victim with an unknown sharp object.

The victim suffered lacerations to his head, torso and hands. He was removed to a hospital described as stable.

Police said the attackers used multiple vehicles to flee the scene.

NYPD Chief Terence Monahan tweeted a video of the assault asking for help.

Hall made two pledges on inauguration Day: One to the flag, and the other to a community close to home.

Hall said, ""I really just wanted to pay homage to the deaf and hard of hearing community. The words of the pledge are significant not just for us, but for them as well.""

For the first ever African American female fire captain in Fulton County, Georgia, it's personal. Her late father was deaf.

Hall said that when she uses sign language, her words take on a special feeling. ""It's a very intimate,"" Hall said. ""It's just like if I spoke another language, like Spanish or French, when you have a native language that you speak. It's like comfort food, you know. It's like mashed potatoes and gravy.""

Hall said she decided ""very early on"" to deliver her Pledge of Allegiance in sign language. ""You're between Lady Gaga and J. Lo. I mean, come on, that's it. And I have like my little 15 seconds of something."" Hall said, ""Those are too hard to be sandwiched between, so I need to put some meat between there, you know?""

At a time of such division — especially at a place like the Capitol, which is recovering from the January 6 insurrection — perhaps the words of the pledge say it all.

""It was written for little children who were immigrants,"" Hall said. ""And in some way, we're all immigrants. You know, we're a mishmash of people from all over.

The head of the department through the COVID-19 pandemic, Gordon had served in the position since he was appointed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in January 2019.

In a Tweet, Gov. Whitmer thanked Gordon for his service and announced his predecessor, Elizabeth Hertel, who is currently the senior chief deputy director for administration within MDHHS.



According to a release, Gov. Whitmer said,

“Elizabeth Hertel has dedicated her career to protecting Michiganders’ public health, and she is uniquely prepared to lead MDHHS as we continue working together to end the COVID-19 pandemic. She has served across multiple administrations from both parties, and knows how to bring people together to get things done. In her service to the state, she has proven time and again that she will do everything in her power to ensure the health and safety of Michigan families everywhere. Ending the COVID-19 pandemic is going to take hard work and partnership between state government, businesses, and organizations across the state. I know that Elizabeth is ready and eager to start working with partners everywhere to get it done.”

“As we work to ramp up distribution of the safe and effective COVID vaccine and end the pandemic, I am eager to work with Governor Whitmer and her administration to keep Michiganders safe and healthy. I am grateful for the opportunity to lead the department at this time. Michigan is faced with a crisis unlike any we have seen before, but our aggressive action against this virus is working. Let’s finish the job and end the COVID-19 pandemic once and for all.”

According to the Detroit Free Press, Whitmer's office says that Gordon's resignation has no impact on any health orders he signed. The final order he signed before his resignation allows indoor dining to resume with restrictions Feb. 1.

The Bidens were falsely accused of firing the White House’s chief usher on their first day in the residence, as previously reported by CNN. It turns out that it wasn’t the new president and first lady who gave the chief usher, Timothy Harleth, his walking papers — it was the Trumps.

Donald and Melania Trump sent White House ushers home early on Inauguration Day in one of their last acts in a tense presidential transition, according to Raw Story.

“The Trumps sent the butlers home when they left so there would be no one to help the Bidens when they arrived,” the official said. “So petty,” said a well-placed official not associated with the Biden team.

Other knowledgeable sources confirmed that Harleth, a former executive of Trump Hotels hired by Melania Trump, was fired by the outgoing president and first lady — and not by the Bidens, as was widely reported afterward.

Harleth had already vacated the premises by the time Joe and Jill Biden arrived at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, leaving no one in place to open the doors for their inaugural entry and leading to an awkward pause.

“It’s a big protocol breach for the president to ever stand in front of a closed door at the White House,” said a veteran White House social expert. “That may be why there was nobody to open the doors to the Bidens. You couldn’t expect the Biden staff to know to do that. Doors are opened and closed by ushers. There are rules about all these things and everyone has their job.”

The rest of the usher staff was back on the job Thursday, but Harleth — considered to be a Trump loyalist — was not expected to be retained by the Bidens for long, Raw Story reported.

The shutdown means associated memorial parks, including Belmont-Paul Women’s Equality National Monument, Ford’s Theatre National Historic Site and the Old Post Office Tower, are closed.

Beyond that, the state’s leading vaccine planners are still figuring things out.

“Because we have limited vaccine, we have to be thoughtful about how to roll these out,” Dr. Patrice Burgess, a family medicine specialist in Boise who is also chairwoman of the state’s COVID-19 vaccine panel, said Friday.

A narrower definition of essential workers will quicken vaccinations in that group, opening access for medically vulnerable people at high-risk for COVID-19 complications. But there are concerns that people in specific jobs with high exposure risk levels that don’t fall into traditional categories may have to unfairly wait until the general public can get shots.

Vaccine planners are trying to strike a balance.

The state is currently vaccinating its top two priority groups. The first consists of about 130,000 health care workers and long-term care facility staff. The next has about 47,000 first responders, pre- and K-12 teachers and jail staff. Those “front-line” essential workers are the first of three subgroups in phase 2, which also includes seniors and other essential workers.

A state vaccine panel on Friday considered four proposals that would, together, let fewer than a few thousand workers in specific jobs access vaccines now or just weeks away. In talks about whether a given job should be prioritized for vaccines, members of the Coronavirus Vaccine Advisory Committee weighed many factors before deciding to tell Gov. Brad Little what he should do.

Some members argued that while some jobs, such as public utility maintenance, are essential, they don’t involve exposure to the virus as much as other jobs. Identifying more targeted people within a subgroup, such as foster care parents who accept children in time-sensitive crises, can more fairly get vaccines to people who have the most exposure risk, some members argued.

As the panel discussed specific jobs, some voting members said they worried that putting more people at the front of the line will only further delay vaccine access to Idahoans with disabilities and medical conditions that put them at high-risk for COVID-19 complications. Those groups are tentatively set to start getting inoculated in late March and early April.

By putting more people at the front of the line, “we are pushing high risk populations further back,” Mel Leviton, director of the State Independent Living Council, said during votes. Many of them “cannot live” or contribute to the economy, Leviton said, if they contract COVID-19 and die or “become hospitalized while grocery shopping.”

What did the panel consider?

The committee voted on four proposals Friday, rejecting all but one. The approved change, which Little must approve, was to the state’s top priority group: Clergy members who enter health care facilities to provide religious services, such as giving last rites to dying patients, are now being considered in the same group as health care workers. The 26 voting members of the panel present on Friday approved the change on a unanimous vote.

The other three proposals were all shot down by wide margins.

1) Should parents in more than 1,000 foster households be considered front-line essential workers in phase 2.1?

The committee shot this down on a 23-3 vote, which followed a close 14-12 initial vote that the panel said wasn’t definitive enough.

2) Should emergency utility, water and power workers be considered front-line essential workers in phase 2.1?

The committee shot this down on an 18-8 vote.

3) Should mail delivery workers who don’t work for the U.S. Postal Service be considered essential workers in phase 2.3 (which is after both front-line essential workers and people age 65 and up, in phase 2.2)? This group would include workers at UPS, FedEx and Amazon Prime.

The panel rejected this on a unanimous vote.

The state has a good idea of who should be in its first and second priority groups. About 291,000 people age 65 and up are the next group in phase 2 to get vaccine access early next month, with other essential workers in sectors such as food, agriculture and manufacturing to follow in late February or early March.

But nothing has been decided for the third priority group, which is expected to include both Idahoans age 16 to 64 who have medical conditions that put them at high-risk for COVID-19 complications and a broader category of “other essential workers.”

That group is set to start receiving vaccinations in late March and early April, depending on vaccine availability. The only group left after them in the state vaccine timeline is the general public. That’s set to start in May.

Priority groups are expected to overlap. In other words, vaccinations for one group don’t necessarily end when a new one begins. No vaccines have been approved for children yet, but medical trials are ongoing.

As of Friday morning, 82,475 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in Idaho, with about 55,000 people getting only their first dose and almost 14,000 people getting both doses. About 68,600 people in Idaho have received at least one COVID-19 shot, the state health department said.

Forty years ago today, on January 24 1981, Lennon’s Aunt Mimi replied to a journalist who wrote to express her shock and offer condolences at the death of Lennon the month before, when he was gunned down outside his apartment by Mark Chapman.

Mimi Smith had raised Lennon in Liverpool from infancy and he later bought her a house in Poole, Dorset, when he found fame.

Responding to Daily Express journalist Judith Simons, who knew Lennon throughout his career, she wrote: “Dear Judith, Thank you for your letter, kind thoughts.

“I’m trying to accept this terrible thing which has happened, but finding it very hard. He had such faith himself, I’m trying to do the same.

“He phoned the night before, witty, funny, bubbling over with excitement, coming over very soon. Couldn’t wait to see me. So I’m glad of that. If I’m in London, I’ll get in touch with you. Kind thoughts to you too. Mimi.”

Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn said: “Mimi’s letter provides solid confirmation that, but for his murder, Lennon would have returned to Britain during 1981 for the first time in 10 years, this knowledge supporting other indications he was considering a concert tour.”

As stated on their official website, the Oath Keepers are a group of both former and current law enforcement and military “who pledge to fulfill the oath all military and police take to ‘defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.'”

In the court document, the three Oath Keepers members, Thomas Edward Caldwell, Donovan Ray Crowl and Jessica Marie Watkins, are being charged with “Knowingly and willfully” conspiring “together and with others whose identities are known and unknown to law enforcement at this time to commit an offense against the United States.”

Caldwell, a 66-year-old Navy veteran, has been identified as the apparent leader by the U.S. authorities who say he arranged for him and dozens of others to “storm the castle” ahead of Jan. 6.

Footage of the Oath Keepers entering the Capitol was collected, while audio of exchanges from the members to others present at the riots was ascertained by the FBI from a two-way radio phone app, Zello. Documents state that Watkins, a 38-year-old Army veteran, could be heard saying, “We have about 30-40 of us. We are sticking together and sticking to the plan.”

What’s more, the charging documents claim the alleged insurrectionists used the radio to update each other on the location of lawmakers.

FBI identified messages such as “all legislators are down in the Tunnels 3floors down,” and “Go through back house chamber doors facing N left down hallway down steps.” One message said: “All members are in the tunnels under capital seal them in. Turn on gas.”

A man can be heard responding to Watkins, saying, “You are executing citizen’s arrest. Arrest this assembly, we have probable cause for acts of treason, election fraud.”

Caldwell, Watkins and Crowl, a 50-year-old former Marine, are being charged with several crimes, including the destruction of government property, disorderly conduct, and conspiracy. They are among over 100 different people who have been charged for the insurrection on the Capitol.

Former President Donald Trump is set to face impeachment for his part in encouraging the rioters. On Jan. 13, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump for a second time as he was first impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of justice, however, he was not convicted in the U.S. Senate. This time, Trump is charged with “incitement of insurrection.”

Trump held a rally of several thousands of his supporters outside of the White House earlier that day, telling them they were “going to the Capitol” to convince Congress to overturn the election results.

CNN reports that the trial for the impeachment is set to take place in the Senate on Feb. 9.

Her stylist, Meredith Koop, shared a post on Instagram Friday to provide more details behind the ensemble, which quickly garnered praise on social media after Mrs. Obama stepped out of her car to attend Wednesday's celebration.

""Now, let's break this down,"" Koop began. ""This is not a jumpsuit. It is gorgeous separates from the exceptional @sergiohudson.

Koop added that she ""knew from the jump"" she wanted to dress Mrs. Obama in pants. ""Pants, pants, pants. Ah, the liberation of pants! No skirts, no dresses. Practical beautiful pants,"" she wrote.

Koop also went on to clarify that the color of the outfit was not meant to be a political statement.

""You can call it berry, wine, plum or burgundy. I'm calling it wineberry plum for the moment. What it wasn't was bi-partisan purple,"" she wrote. ""That's a cute story, but it wasn't the intention. I love the different textures in the coat, pants, sweater and belt of this monochromatic look. It was the perfect balance.""

""What I want to convey most, though, is that this particular outfit is about the woman wearing it more than anything,"" Koop wrote. ""It is about her and what she means to you and to America. She is powerful and she needs to move. She is stunning and she represents what is possible. She is relatable and she is aspirational. She has consistently articulated over the years what has been in the hearts and minds of so many. She has taken a look at the rule book and turned the page.

683,684,https://www.wtvr.com/news/coronavirus/why-virginia-is-changing-vaccine-distribution-approach,"RICHMOND, Va. -- Virginia’s state vaccine coordinator said that the Virginia Department of Health will change how it allocates doses of the COVID-19 vaccine due to the on-going shortage of the vaccine and that if the supply does not increase, it could take between two to three months to finish vaccinating those eligible under Phase 1A and 1B of the rollout.

""For now, most recipients should know that they're going to, pretty reliably, get what they're getting for the next four weeks or so,"" said Dr. Danny Avula during a telebriefing on Friday. ""We need to manage and temper expectations, because with just several hundred, or in some cases, a couple thousands doses coming to each community, there are not going to be that many slots for people to get vaccinated. And so, folks who are in 1B and are looking to get vaccinated, we need to realize that it will likely, without a significant change in the supply of the vaccine, we're looking at two to three months to work through this population.""

As of Friday, the Virginia Department of Health's COVID-19 vaccine dashboard said 1,010,150 doses had been distributed in the state, with 424,857 doses administered or just above 42%. According to the Bloomberg's national vaccination tracker, the national average as of early Saturday is 49.7%. Virginia's seven-day average of daily shots administered is 19,405.

During the briefing, Avula said his role, which he started two weeks ago, to improve Virginia's vaccine rollout is organized into three phases: addressing the gap in reporting, dealing with the supply and demand issue, and building up the state's vaccination infrastructure to be prepared for an increase in supply.

Avula said a lot of his work since starting the job has been accounting for where Virginia's vaccine shipments are going and being, or not, reported quickly when administered.

""Right now, if you look at the data, you see that there's just under 600,000 doses that are not accounted for,"" said Avula. ""There's really a need to understand why that is, where those doses are, and how does the public understand the current state of vaccine supply in Virginia.""

Avula reiterated what he and other state leaders have said in the past about the gap between shots distributed and administered and said they will never close that gap completely as shipments arrive each week. He said that gap will be between 170,000 to 200,000 depending on the number of first and second doses delivered each week.

""The additional second doses that we get vary. Sometimes it's 60,000. Sometimes a little more,"" added Avula.

Avula had said Thursday that there was approximately 90,000 doses that had been administered to Virginians, but not entered into the state database. He said a new team of ten people was deployed this week to help address that issue.

He also said that the majority of Virginia's doses reserved for the federal partnership with pharmacies Walgreens and CVS to vaccinate residents and staff of long-term care facilities have yet to be used.

""226,000 doses were earmarked and set aside for CVS and Walgreens. Now, not all of those doses have been delivered, not all of them have gone down, but they are set aside,"" said Avula, who added that as of Thursday they had administered around 66,000 doses. ""There is a large number of cases, probably around 100,000 at this point, that have been distributed into Virginia, but, has not been administered yet.""

Avula said they have been speaking with state leadership for those two pharmacies and said they are working to accelerate their vaccination pace and are aiming to get through all of the nursing homes and assisted living facilities by the end of January. He said some of the challenges they are facing include outbreaks at facilities, which pushes back when vaccinators can come in, and that the willingness of people in those facilities to get the vaccine has been low.

""We've heard anecdotally different numbers that it seems like the residents, the elderly residents of these facilities have higher uptake - 70-to-80%. But, the staff are lower. Down like 30-to-40%,"" said Avula. He added that some staff members are later willing to get vaccinated after seeing their colleagues do so. Avula said they are also in discussion with CVS and Walgreens to reallocate some of those federally earmarked vaccines to other pharmacies to help speed up the process. ""They are looking at their projections for how much vaccine that they're going to need to get through their three phases…and that they will be willing to allow us to reallocate to other pharmacies. So, I'll know probably Monday or so what that number is and how we would go about approaching that.""

Avula said that Virginia received 105,000 doses this past week, while it had requests from around the state for almost 300,000 doses and they are expecting to face a similar discrepancy for the next several weeks, so VDH will start allocating doses based solely on percentage of population.

""So, for each community we know what percentage of the population they have and then assign that percentage of this week's allotment to them,"" said Avula. ""What we also did was we really leaned on our local health departments as the ESF [Emergency Support Functions]…leads in their community to coordinate the response.""

Avula said the local health departments have been told how much vaccine their districts would receive and worked with their partners to determine how the doses would be allocated within their districts.

""So, that looks different from district to district. In some cases, health departments and hospitals are working hand-in-hand to do large scale PODs [point of dispensing],"" added Avula. ""In different areas, you'll have different vaccine channels. Some of that's going to happen through large scale vaccinations, some of its going to happen through partnership with pharmacies that focus on segments of the population.

""Health departments are really working hard to figure out how to prioritize that vaccine. We are continuing to prioritize 1A individuals who did not, who may not have gotten vaccinated on the first round and, so, they will be worked into clinics as available,"" said Avula. ""And then we have this very large 1B group. And I think the challenge of this is when you're only getting a couple thousand doses a week to be distributed between hospitals, health systems, health departments, providers, and pharmacies -- how do you do that in a way that even comes close to meeting demand? And the answer is you don't. You can't. And, understandably, that has led to a great deal of confusion and frustration on the part of our public who says, 'Hey, I'm in 1B. Why can't I find a place to get vaccinated?'""

Avula said health departments and their partners should provide capacity each week for the 65+ portion of 1B and, simultaneously, provide vaccination opportunities for frontline essential workers.

Avula was asked if going forward, because of the limited vaccine supply, should health districts stop the practice of allowing people from outside their jurisdiction attend the open POD events to get the vaccine. Avula said he would watch to see how that issue emerges.

""If there are situations where that seems to be abused or is creating big inequities, because people in a neighboring district have more ability to drive themselves across the country line,"" said Avula. ""Then we'll need to relook at that and revisit…are we more restrictive about place of residence?""

Finally, Avula said the third phase of VDH's planning is building the infrastructure for mass vaccination clinics that will be necessary to reach Governor Ralph Northam's goal of 50,000 vaccinations a day and inoculate 70%-to-80% of the population and attain herd immunity.

Avula said there is also tremendous capacity in the state's health systems and health departments, but they also have about 2,000 provider groups and 400 pharmacies who have been approved to provide vaccinations.

""I don't have any concerns about us being able to get to 50,000 doses a day,"" said Avula. ""Except that we don't have the vaccine.""

Most patients with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms. However, in a small proportion of patients, COVID-19 can lead to more severe illness, including death, particularly among those who are older or those who have chronic medical conditions.

COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Symptoms appear within 14 days of being exposed to an infectious person.

The changes to the regulation governing coronavirus restrictions were made as part of a review of the third lockdown earlier this month by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the Telegraph said.

The regulation, which applies to England only, was due to expire last week but has now been extended until July 17, around the date when school summer holidays begin, the Telegraph added.

Emily Skye, 36, has revealed some of the ‘hurtful’ messages she has received over her post-baby body.

It has been seven months since Australian fitness star Emily Skye gave birth to her second child - and after experiencing a barrage of vile comments about her post-baby body, she has an important message to share.

The Gold Coast trainer, 36, who is known for her successful online fitness program Emily Skye Fit, spoke exclusively to news.com.au about some of the ""hurtful"" messages she has been receiving since the birth of her son Izaac in June last year.

She said that while she experienced body shaming after having her eldest daughter Mia, 3, some of the things people are writing to her now are ""a lot worse"".

""If I engage, it's always kind, I'm never nasty back,"" Emily said.

""And as much as what she said was hurtful and pissed me off, I thought she must be in pain herself or something must have happened because her prior messages were nice - she would tell me I have such a lovely bond with my daughter and ask if I have had Izaac yet.""

Emily responded to the woman saying, ""I hope you are OK, sending love.""

But admittedly, she said like most people, it's never nice to receive nasty comments, especially one's about your children.

Other comments have centred around her post-baby body, with some reading: ""Yuck. Adding to list of reasons to never have Kids. RIP fit bod. Unfollowing"", to ""Well you better practice what you preach, because looking at your rig … it's not in good order to steal millions off the public … your (sic) a scab"".

She explained that despite her body naturally changing after birth, it doesn't take away from her experience and qualifications as a personal trainer.

""After I had my daughter, I had this feeling that I needed to be fit - I thought I had to look fit to be an expert in fitness, but I am still an expert because I will always have that knowledge and experience,"" she said.

Emily, who has a combined social media following of 12.5 million, said she is initially filled with anger by the harsh comments.

""I am irritated, frustrated and hurt - all those natural human responses, but then I go OK, let's take control now, I am not going to let them bring me down.""

""I practise deep breathing, it helps calm me down and I think about it; that they are coming from a place of pain and not thinking clearly.""

She purposely posts photos showing her differences, to prove no one is perfect - not even social media influencers.

And by sharing her own body shaming experience, she wants to remind women to always love themselves and not let anyone negatively influence your relationship with your body.

""I've said this before - I love my body so much and I am grateful for everything it has done for me and my kids,"" Emily said.

But it was a moment straight after giving birth to her son, when she felt the most connected and grateful for her body.

""I always used to be focused on how I looked and wanting to be lean, but now I am obsessed with my body's functions,"" Emily said.

""I made a promise to myself the day I gave birth to my son Izaac that if I were to ever have negative thoughts about my body I'd remind myself of what it's done for me and how blessed I am.""



 She said it was after she was taken to hospital following her emergency birth it was then she had a moment of realisation.

""After I took my first shower (following the birth) I looked in the mirror, held my belly and said 'thank you', you are amazing'.""

""I thought to myself if I every get those feelings and worry about things like stretch marks, I have to think about that moment and remember what it has done.

""And I have never have had to remind myself to this day.""

Part of the reason for Emily's huge success and social media following is attributed to her raw and honest posts.

In fact, for her newly created post-pregnancy program, to be released February 1, the mother-of-two recorded it in real-time with her post-pregnancy body.

""It's not a year later when I am back in shape with abs - I want people to go through my journey with me, to see I also struggle, have stretched skin and everything.""

Emily, who worked with a post-natal expert on the program, said she is really proud of it and her body in getting through the training.

It is filmed in three stages - recover, progress and rebuild and it also covers mental wellbeing, self esteem and body image expectations.

Emily has been back at training five days a week and while she said it has been challenging, particularly finding the motivation, she added that she has never felt stronger.

691,692,https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2021/01/24/people-smugglers-jailed-up-to-27-years,"A BRITISH judge handed down sentences of 27 and 20 years to the ringleaders of a people smuggling plot that led to the death of 39 Vietnamese migrants in horrific conditions in the back of a lorry.

The 39 – the youngest of whom were two 15-year-old boys – suffocated in the container as they were being transported to what they had hoped would be new lives in Britain.

The lifeless bodies of the migrants were discovered inside the sealed unit at a port near London in October, 2019.

The case cast a shocking new light on the lengths migrants will go to reach Britain – and the gangs exploiting their desperation.

Ringleaders Ronan Hughes and Gheorghe Nica, who were convicted on 39 counts of manslaughter, were jailed at London’s Old Bailey criminal court for 20 years and 27 years respectively.

Truck drivers Maurice Robinson and Eamonn Harrison were also given 13-year and 18-year sentences respectively.

Judge Nigel Sweeney told the court the gang’s operation was a “sophisticated, long running and profitable one to smuggle Vietnamese migrants across the channel”.

He told the defendants they would serve at least two-thirds of their terms in custody, instead of the usual half.

Robinson, from Craigavon, Northern Ireland, found the bodies in the container after picking it up following its cross-Channel journey.

He pleaded guilty to 39 manslaughter charges, as did haulage boss Ronan Hughes, 41, from Armagh, also Northern Ireland.

Harrison, of County Down, Northern Ireland, and Romanian national Nica, from Basildon, east of London, denied manslaughter but were found guilty after a 10-week trial that ended last year.

Harrison claimed during the trial he did not know the migrants had been loaded into the lorry he drove to Zeebrugge in Belgium, where he caught the ferry to Britain.

Detective Chief Inspector Danny Stoten, of Essex Police, said outside court that the gang “made their money from misery”.

“They treated the victims as a commodity and they transported them in ways we would not transport animals, ” he said, adding he hoped the case sent a strong message that others involved in this activity “will face justice”.

Haulage firm boss Hughes, 41, closed his eyes during the trial as he heard recordings of the victims’ distressing final moments.

In one message, a man struggled for air as he apologised to his family, saying “I can’t breathe”.

“I want to come back to my family. Have a good life, ” he added, as distressed noises from other victims were heard in the background.

The victims’ families spelled out the human and financial cost of the tragedy in statements read out by prosecutor Jonathan Polnay in court.

Nguyen Huy Tung, whose 15-year-old son Nguyen Huy Hung died in the tragedy, said the family “did not believe it was the truth until we saw his body by our own eyes” at the hospital.

“We were shocked, trembled, we lost track and awareness of our surroundings, ” he added. “My wife had fainted many times whenever our son’s name was mentioned.”

A forensic expert calculated it would have taken about nine hours for the air to turn toxic in the trailer, with death coming soon after. — AFP",People smugglers jailed up to 27 years,www.thestar.com.my

Kyle Rittenhouse was 17 during the Aug. 25 demonstration in Kenosha as hundreds were protesting the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man. Rittenhouse has been charged with multiple counts, including reckless and intentional homicide, endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm.

Prosecutors allege Rittenhouse, who is white, left his home in Antioch, Illinois, and traveled to Kenosha to answer a call for militia to protect businesses. Kenosha was in the throes of several nights of chaotic street demonstrations after a white officer shot Blake in the back during a domestic disturbance, leaving Blake paralyzed.

Rittenhouse opened fire with an assault-style rifle during the protest, killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, authorities said. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to all counts and argued he fired in self-defense. Conservatives have rallied around him, generating enough money to make his $2 million cash bail.

Kyle Rittenhouse accused of flashing white power sign at bar:Prosecutors want him to stay away from Proud Boys

According to online court records, a Wisconsin judge modified Rittenhouse's conditions of release on Friday to note Rittenhouse “shall not knowingly have conduct with any person or group of persons known to harm, threaten, harass or menace others on the basis of their race, beliefs on the subject of religion, color, national origin, or gender.""

He is also barred from possessing and consuming alcohol and from having firearms.

Prosecutors had requested the modifications after Rittenhouse was seen drinking at a bar in the southeastern Wisconsin city of Mount Pleasant, about 25 miles south of Milwaukee, this month. The legal drinking age is 21, but in Wisconsin, Rittenhouse could legally drink alcohol because he was with his mother.

According to WMTV, prosecutors wrote in their request that Rittenhouse also posed for a photo outside Pudgy's Pub with two men as they made the “OK” sign with their hands, a symbol used by white supremacists. Prosecutors also alleged five men at the tavern serenaded Rittenhouse with a song that has become the anthem of the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist group.",Kyle Rittenhouse prohibited from association with supremacists under modified bail conditions,www.freep.com

As frustration mounts over slow COVID-19 vaccine rollouts at CVS and Walgreens around the country, Maine has been shifting supplies away from chain pharmacies to independent ones.This week, the state transferred 975 doses from Walgreens to an independent pharmacy and next week it plans to transfer 500 doses away from CVS, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.""The decision was driven by the principles of velocity and equity, which are foundations of Maine's vaccination plan,"" Robert Long, a Maine CDC spokesperson, told ABC News in a statement. ""The doses had not been committed to scheduled clinics, so the Maine Immunization Program redirected them to vaccination sites that had ready and immediate needs.""This week, Maine didn't send any of the doses it received from the federal government to CVS or Walgreens.But according to Long, the decision to pause the retail pharmacy program isn't a policy shift. Instead, he said, it reflects the fact that CVS and Walgreens already had enough doses to fulfill their commitments for the week.""This is not an issue of pace,"" a CVS spokesperson told ABC News. ""The 500 doses noted are being moved because the operator of 14 long-term care facilities -- Shalom House in Portland -- wanted to move to Bedard Pharmacy, with whom they have an existing relationship.""""There are several factors that may leave us with more doses than initially planned,"" a Walgreens spokesperson told ABC News. ""For example, the patient population at a long-term care facility has shifted, patients or staff elect not to get the vaccine, or a facility overestimated doses needed.""""We are not messing around with this,"" Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said during a news conference last week. ""We've got doses waiting to be administered and people waiting to receive them. If we see a mismatch there, we are going to continue moving things around in that fashion.""It remains to be seen if Maine will follow in the footsteps of West Virginia, which was lauded for a successful vaccine rollout that relied on partnering with independent pharmacies instead of chains.As of Jan. 21, West Virginia had vaccinated 9,349 out of every 100,000 residents, among the best per capita rates in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . By comparison, Maine's per capita vaccination rate was 5,989 vaccines administered for every 100,000 people.And while the Maine CDC said that West Virginia's success with independent pharmacies had no influence on Maine's decision to reallocate doses, the two states do have some key similarities.While slightly more than half of pharmacies in Maine are chains, compared to 41% of pharmacies in West Virginia, both states have a dearth of chains in rural neighborhoods, according to an ABC News analysis of SafeGraph data. In Maine, there are only six chain pharmacies per 100,000 people in rural areas. Rural neighborhoods in West Virginia have roughly eight chain pharmacies per 100,000 people.John Beckner, senior director of strategic initiatives at the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents independent pharmacies, said that independent pharmacies had wanted to be involved in the initial vaccine distribution effort.""We had numerous meetings and calls with CDC and HHS. We lobbied,"" he said. ""By and large, states have elected to use CVS and Walgreens. In some cases that worked OK. In other cases, there were a lot of bumps in the road.""And despite the perception that independent pharmacies aren't as well equipped as the big chains to handle vaccinations, Beckner, a pharmacist by training, stressed that independent pharmacists often have decades of experience immunizing patients. There's also the relationship factor: In addition to existing partnerships with nursing homes, in rural communities without a doctor, local pharmacist sometimes double as primary care.While tricky requirements for storing the Pfizer vaccine make the Moderna a more realistic option for pharmacies ""the main challenge for our members has been access to the vaccine,"" Beckner said.More states are reaching out to independent pharmacies, according to Beckner, and with the prospect of additional vaccines like Johnson & Johnson's in the pipeline, Beckner is hopeful that independents will have a bigger role to play when vaccinations of the general public start.""What we've seen in West Virginia is best practice, quite frankly,"" he said.

The late photojournalist documented natural disasters and wars by bringing his feet — which he called ""the greatest zoom lens ever invented"" — close into the lives of people.

As an NPR staff photographer, he enjoyed all the jokes about taking pictures for a radio network. Shooting stories around the world, he won numerous awards for capturing loss, struggle and even joy.

As he watched a war-torn Afghanistan change around him, he wrote in 2013, ""I photographed the little things I had stopped seeing.""

While on assignment there in June 2016, David and his interpreter, Zabihullah Tamanna, were ambushed and killed by the Taliban.

A new book of David's photographs, titled Pictures on the Radio, memorializes both his work, and David himself, through memory-filled essays from several of his former NPR colleagues, closing with an afterword by his mother Alyda Gilkey.

""All of his pictures seem to have a story,"" Alyda told NPR. ""I think that was a part of the magic of his photographs.""

In an interview with Weekend Edition, she remembers her son, the man behind the lens.

The following excerpts has been edited for length and clarity. Click the audio link to hear the full interview.

Please tell us about him growing up — the little boy in the basement.

He was a bit of a handful when he was growing up. My husband, Dick, was a school administrator, but he really loved photography. And so, when we built our house, he put a darkroom in the basement. And we discovered later that when we would send David downstairs to go play with all the toys in that part of the basement, he would often go in and look at his dad's photographs, which we're standing up in a big cabinet. Dick showed both kids how to use the darkroom, and David really took to it.

Was his camera a kind of passport to the world, do you think?

Oh, definitely, yes. He loved to travel, loved to go and see places. So the camera was just perfect for him. And when he got his first job with a newspaper in Boulder, Colorado, then the company that owned that — Knight Ridder — sent him to South Africa. And he just thought that was wonderful. Then when he went to NPR, that was just perfect because he could travel the world from there.

Alyda, I got to ask, did you worry about him?

Of course, always. When he was growing up, he was always doing things fast anyway. I mean, he skied fast, he skated fast. He was on the roller speed skating team, which was just the perfect thing for him.

The photos in this book are utterly stunning and, just to note a few: I think the cover photograph isLance Cpl. AnthonyEspinoza in Helmand province [in Afghanistan], wiping the sweat from his eyes with his gloved finger, and Crystal Turner, a Marine vet hugging her year-and-a half-old daughter to her knees when she's home. And then a Palestinian man on the West Bank holding his dead pet bird after an attack.

This is personal — but I have to ask. Did you ever did you ever urge him to stop as he approached his 50s, you know, say, come on, David, settle down in Happy Valley [in Oregon]?

I talked to him about it once and I said, 'What kind of photography do you really want to do?' And he said, 'I want to do the kind where I have to go out into the world and find out what's happening.' And I said, 'Well, I guess you're never going to be a wedding photographer.' And he said, 'No way. No way.' It was just what he wanted to do.

Why do you think people opened up their lives to him — as so many did?

Well, there was just something about him that was, I don't really know how to describe, but there was something about his personality that just seemed to put people at ease and so they would just talk to him.

What do you hope people will know about your son as they go through this book?

I hope that they'll realize that he was very sensitive. And that kind of got him in a little trouble when he was growing up because people didn't realize how sensitive he was, but — he was a good son.

President Donald Trump, through his America First policy, redefined the US' image abroad. But that image has also been altered through his actions and words - not least his reported dismissal of African countries in highly derogatory terms.

And though the office of the president can be separated from the individual, President Biden will, in the light of the last four years, have to address Kenya and the rest of the continent in a markedly different tone and with a markedly different message.

But aside from the failure to release tax returns, undermining intelligence agencies and contradicting scientists in the midst of a pandemic, the events of 6 January, when the president's supporters stormed the US Capitol, showed that this went beyond one man.

In military terms, for many years the US has been described as the world's policeman but when it comes to democratic norms it has also been called the world's prefect. But can opposition movements and civil society groups in countries like Kenya now rely on Washington for support when elections come?

697,698,https://punchng.com/ibarapaland-oyo-community-laments-ordeals-at-the-hands-of-killer-herdsmen/,"The violence which erupted in Igangan, Ibarapa area of Oyo State on Friday didn’t come as a surprise to many who had followed developments in the area. Thousands of youths from Eruwa, Igboora, Tapa, Ayete and other areas in Ibarapaland trooped out to welcome an activist, Sunday Adeyemo, who is popularly known as Sunday Igboho, to the place on Friday. They waited for him to lead them against those they alleged had caused them pains, sorrow and miseries.

Prominent and promising indigenes of the area have been killed, maimed and their farms destroyed at will. They have constantly and quietly mourned their human and material losses and licked their wounds with little or no succour from the concerned authorities. Government security agencies appear to have failed the people and when Igboho offered himself to rid the land of criminals, they welcomed him without open arms. The youths on Friday waited for Igboho to return to Igangan and the huge crowd that welcomed him showed that they had been waiting for liberation from those they call their oppressors.

Igboho, who addressed the youths on the premises of Igangan Townhall assured the people of the area that their fears over insecurity had come to an end. He said what he started in Igangan would not end there, adding that bandits would be driven out of Yorubaland.

He said, “If you are a law-abiding person, we will not have any problem with you. But if you want to be kidnapping and killing us in our land, we won’t allow you to stay here. There is no more danger of insecurity. I swear there is nothing to fear again. What we are doing here will not be limited to this place, we will drive away herdsmen from Yorubaland.”

Tension started mounting on Thursday night following the expiration of the notice to quit given to herdsmen in the area by Igboho. He went to the settlement of Salihu Abdukadir, who is the Seriki Fulani of Oyo State and warned him and his kinsmen to vacate the area before seven days. The activist spoke with the Seriki who many residents said could not be challenged because of his connection to the powerful people in the country.

Igboho went to the settlement and accused the Fulani of being behind the atrocities committed in the area including killings, abduction and armed robbery. Some rich persons in Ibarapaland had fallen victims of the hoodlums and one of the residents said the rising insecurity forced Igboho to confront the Seriki.

Seriki was reported to have told the people that the Fulani were law-abiding people, admitting that some criminals had infiltrated them. However, the Seriki told our correspondent on Friday night that he had fled the community, lamenting loss of lives and property.

But the people of Ibarapaland have lived together with the Fulani pastoralists for a long time and many residents of the area said their relationship was mutual until recent times. The hosts accommodated the strangers and while the indigenes, mostly farmers, cultivated the land, the herders grazed their livestock without destroying the farms except on a few occasions.

Everything has changed. Herdsmen destroyed farms and there were occasions that farmers said herdsmen intentionally set their farms on fire to punish them for chasing away cattle grazing on their farms. Some of the farmers earlier told our correspondent that some Fulani herdsmen stormed their farms, uprooted yam tubers to feed cattle.

The President of Igangan Agro Park Investors Association, Mr Oluwafemi Abioye, had told our correspondent that farmers in the area collectively lost N320m to herdsmen attack and after two months of continued plundering of farms, he said the loss rose to over N400m. Abioye said the land was formerly a forest reserve which the administration of former Governor Abiola Ajimobi converted for farming because human activities had led to its deforestation.

Abioye said, “ They keep returning to destroy our farms because they know they would easily be left off the hook. There are many cases of malicious damage on our farms against the herdsmen. If you go to the Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, you will see several cases there, but the people will go scot-free. You won’t get justice and they know it. If a herder destroys 20 acres of cassava or maize, for instance, when the police are invited or the case is taken to them, the herder would plead to pay N50,000.”

He said signing the anti-open grazing bill into law by the governor would largely address insecurity in the area because it would expose those hiding under cattle grazing to perpetrate crime.

The attack and plundering of farms are not limited to big investors as a farmer in Apodun village, Joseph Ogundijo, whose farm was destroyed by two herdsmen identified as Nasiru Yahaya and Monu Yahaya told Sunday PUNCH that the duo uprooted cassava planted on one acre of land and fed their cattle with it.

Ogundijo said, “We can’t even go to our farms again because we don’t know when herdsmen may attack us. We are living in fear. Our farms are destroyed without anybody to help us. Two herdsmen went to my farm and uprooted cassava planted on one acre of land to feed their cattle. The cattle were many, they ate almost everything. The case was reported to the Agro Ranger Office and eventually, they said the herdsmen should pay me N40,000 compensation for what I would have sold for about N500,000.”

Another farmer who said he narrowly escaped being killed by herdsmen, Mr Sola Akintola, told our correspondent that he went to his farm to harvest cassava some time ago.

Akintola said, “After the vans left, I stayed back for them to load the remaining cassava tubers. But not long after, some herdsmen came with hundreds of cattle. I told them to move to the part of the farm where we had harvested before but they insisted on feeding the uprooted cassava to their cattle and I said no. They attacked me until they injured my hand. I ran away and reported the case at Igangan Police Station. The police took my name and asked me to get medical treatment. Going to farm is like going to the battlefield here because if one is not fortified, one may not return alive.”

Aside economic loss recorded daily by the farmers, kidnapping, robbery, rape, brutal attacks are common in the area.

While Fulani are not the only non-indigenes living in Ibarapaland, residents have accused them of being behind the killings, kidnappings and other crimes usually perpetrated against members of the host communities in the area.

Popular herbal medicine practitioner, Alhaji Fatai Yusuf, otherwise called Oko Oloyun, was shot dead in Ibarapaland while wife of a traditional ruler, Fumbi Ojo and her daughter undergoing the one-year mandatory National Youth Service Corps were kidnapped by the hoodlums in April 2020.

A female farmer, Modupe Oyetoso, whose fiancé was shot dead by kidnappers, was returning from the farm with the deceased when the incident happened. Oyetoso was abducted and the family paid ransom before she was freed by the Fulani who abducted her. Apart from the lady, some others had been victims of kidnapping.

A prominent farmer, Dr Fatai Aborode, who was the candidate of the Accord Party for the election into the House of Representatives in 2015, was killed in December 2020. Aborode’s farm manager, Bolanle Olanrewaju, while narrating the last moment of his boss said the two of them were on the same motorcycle and the motorcycle carrying Aborode’s wife was coming behind.

He said their assailants suddenly jumped out of the bush and waylaid them after they took him inside the bush and made him lie down while one of the hoodlums watched over him. He said his boss was killed and he ran further into the bush when he heard a gunshot and the noise from the shooting of Aborode.

The owner of a filling station, Mrs Sherifat Adisa, was kidnapped, killed and her corpse dumped a few meters away from her away filling station along Igboora/Idere road. Two young boys of about nine years old, who were said to be cousins, were felled by the bullets of the woman’s killers. And barely 24 hours after that a medical doctor, John Akindele, was abducted.

The Convener of Igangan Development Advocates, Mr Oladiran Oladokun, who is a farmer, told our correspondent that residents of the town had protested and written petitions to the governor on the constant threats to their lives. He added that nothing was done about it.

He said the refusal of the governor to sign the Oyo State Open Rearing and Grazing Regulation Bill 2019 was one of factors responsible for the lingering insecurity in the area.

Oladiran said, “Seriki Fulani must be arrested and prosecuted for any government to tackle the problem of insecurity in the area. He has been fingered in some cases. People are attacked on their farms and the assailants known and complaints lodged, but the police would not do anything about it. Police cannot arrest suspects from Fulani settlements. I believe there are people who he employed to carry out some nefarious activities for him.’’

Some residents of the area expressed disappointment at the governor’s broadcast which they said showed sympathy to the herdsmen, accusing him of downplaying the security challenges facing the people. The President of Ibarapa Development Forum, Etomilade Oduola, in a statement on Friday blamed the governor’s position on what he described as his perceived disconnection from the area.

Oduola said, “At this critical point, the governor needs to connect directly with the region the same way he did when he much needed ‘peoples’ mandate. We are aware and we affirm that the governor must be the governor of all. His broadcast however only expressed sympathy to the cause of the marauding herdsmen and sheer insensitivity to Ibarapa lives that have been lost to the criminals in the recent past. Governor Makinde makes a poor attempt at political correctness in an escalating insecurity crisis. The safety of the people must be paramount and the government must stop playing politics with our lives.”

Earlier, the governor in a statewide broadcast warned those giving people quit notices to desist from it or be ready to face the wrath of the law. But Friday’s development made the governor give an order that anybody stoking ethnic crisis should be arrested by the police. He gave this order when the new Commissioner of Police in Oyo State, Ngozi Onadeko, paid him a courtesy visit on Friday.

The governor said, “For people stoking ethnic tension, they are criminals and once you get them, they should be arrested and treated like common criminals. For this administration, the major pillar for us is security, because we know that all the good economic plans we have won’t be possible in an atmosphere of chaos and insecurity.’’

Also speaking, the Secretary-General of Yoruba Council of Elders, Dr Kunle Olajide, said the political elite, especially the governors in the South-West could not claim to be ignorant of the atrocities of criminal herdsmen against the people.

Olajide said, “Yoruba political leadership elite must not be insensitive to what is going on and the challenges confronting the Yoruba nation in Nigeria today. Our political leadership elite, especially our governors must appreciate the loss suffered by the raped women, orphaned and destruction of farms in our zone. Anything that has to do with that must be approached with caution.”

699,700,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9180179/Hamptons-stable-owner-says-ousted-make-room-Alec-Hilaria-Baldwin.html,"A woman in the Hamptons has spoken out to claim that she was 'ousted' from a property where she ran horse stables, which now hosts next-door neighbors Alec and Hilaria Baldwin's horse rescue charity.

Jan Warner, 60, told the New York Post in an interview published Saturday that she was forced to shut down 'Jan's Barn' in 2017 after the landlord demanded a year's rent in advance.

Today, the property is rented by the Baldwins, who stable rescue horses and also rent out stalls to their well-heeled friends for $1,500 a month, and managed by Pat Granfield, a close friend of Hilaria, according to the Post.

An attorney for the Baldwins, Marc Simon, told DailyMail.com that all proceeds from the boarded horses go to support the rescue charity, and notes that 'Alec and Hilaria created the rescue as a public service for the community.'

Warner lamented that she had lost her longtime business, and suggested that her wealthy neighbors might have engineered her ouster, saying: 'I think Alec and Hilaria didn't like the fact that I didn't have this immaculate, perfect place.'

Simon disputes Warner's claim that the Baldwins had anything to do with the termination of her lease, and said that the stable property owner 'grew dissatisfied with Jan’s maintenance of the Property and her inability to maintain rent payments' and evicted her in 2017.

Warner claimed that she had paid rent of $2,000 a month for the stables in Amagansett through a handshake agreement with the landlord, Job Potter. But in 2017 Potter abruptly asked for a year's rent in advance, Warner said.

'I couldn't pay the whole year upfront and he knew that,' Warner told the Post, saying she believed it was the landlord's 'way of getting rid of me.'

A lawyer for the Baldwins said that the couple had nothing to do with Warner's departure from the property.

The attorney claimed Potter had issues with her ability to keep up with the rent and that 'it was widely known throughout the neighborhood that the property was not maintained in a habitable condition, but rather was run-down and in a condition of squalor, and posed dangerous risks.'

Simon, the attorney, said that the Baldwins' only connection to the matter was that their house is adjacent to the stables property. He said that after the property owner evicted Warner put the horse farm on the market, the Baldwins spoke with him about renting it for a horse rescue and entered into a lease in January 2018.

'Alec and Hilaria used their own funds to rehabilitate the Property at a significant cost, and by the spring of 2018 horses were able to be maintained on the Property in a safe and friendly environment,' Simon said in a statement.

He said the stable currently houses six rescue horses and six boarded horses, and that all proceeds from boarding support the charity. Simon said that the Baldwins do not keep their own horses there, he said.

'The Rescue hosts free events for children to interact with the animals, along with free programs for children with autism,' Simon said. 'Local newspapers published event listings so that families would know to join.'

People who boarded their horses at the barn with Warner disputed that she let the property fall into disrepair, telling the Post that although the barn wasn't pristine or Hamptons-chic, it was welcoming and beloved by both rich and poor.

'There's no one I'd trust more with my horses than Jan Warner,' financial services professional Kelley Foster told the Post. Warner now lives in an East Hampton trailer park and works for Foster in a private stable.

Granfield, who now manages the stables for Alec and Hilaria, is a well-dressed equestrian who owns a home on the Upper East Side.

Warner previously knew Granfield, because Warner had allowed her to stable her horses and give riding lessons there, according to the Post.

'The two of them are real tight and they're both real hoity toitys,' Warner said of Granfield and Hilaria, saying Granfield was a frequent guest of the Baldwins and boasted of having the 'best rosé' with the couple.

Warner and her friends call Granfield 'Equine Barbie,' and claim her knowledge of horses is inferior to Warner's.

Granfield told the Post of her work at the Baldwin stables: 'I'll say we're just doing simple and good work for animals and the community.'

The East End stable controversy comes after Alec appeared to leave Twitter last week amid the fall-out from wife Hilaria's on-going scandal in which she was accused of faking her Spanish heritage and accent.

The 62-year-old SNL actor posted a tweet on January 18 saying: 'Twitter is like a party where everyone is screaming. Not much of a party. Goodbye for now.'

The Academy Award-nominee's departure from the social media site is the latest episode in the unfolding scandal around his wife and mother of their five children, Hilaria, who has been accused of faking her Spanish heritage when she was born in Boston, Massachusetts .

The 30-Rock star previously defended his 36-year-old wife saying in a video in December where he called Twitter is 'a lot of s***'.

Baldwin, who previously won an Emmy for his portrayal of President Donald Trump on SNL, added: 'You have to kind of hack your way through the debris of Twitter. Twitter is just a vast orchard of cr**.'

On January 3 Hilaria Baldwin’s sister-in-law Chynna Phillips defended her in a YouTube video Tuesday saying: 'It's an awkward and embarrassing time for her'.

The online frenzy began on December 21 when a woman tweeted: 'You have to admire Hilaria Baldwin's commitment to her decade long grift where she impersonates a Spanish person.'

In the next few days several videos of Hilaria's past TV appearances resurfaced showing her commitment to a Spanish accent, including one in 2015 where she seemingly forgot the English word for 'cucumber'.

A video of Alec on The Late Show in 2013 emerged days after in which he impersonated his wife's 'Spanish' accent, telling David Letterman: 'My wife is from Spain.'

And Hilaria herself indicated in one 2020 interview that she moved from Spain to the US when she was 19 to attend New York University.

Hilaria's biography on her agency's speakers site stated that she was born on the island of Majorca and raised in Boston, without specifying a timeline for her upbringing.

Her agency later removed that reference and simply listed her professional work history after.

While Hilaria has long described her mother as Spanish, records revealed that Hayward is in fact a fourth-generation Massachusetts resident.

She was was born Hillary Hayward-Thomas to Dr Kathryn Hayward and David Thomas, who worked as professors in the US for years before retiring to Majorca in 2011, according to Page Six.

She attended $64,900-a-year The Cambridge School of Weston in Massachusetts.

Several former classmates came forward to confirm that Hilaria was in fact raised in Weston, Massachusetts, by professor parents without a hint of a foreign accent.

Majorcan friends of her parents, who moved to the Spanish island in 2011, said last month that she speaks to them in English.

In January it was revealed that in 2009 she took two attempts to fill out her W9 tax form, dithering between two names, before filling in the name she was born with.",Hamptons stable owner says she was 'ousted' for Alec and Hilaria,www.dailymail.co.uk
700,701,https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2021/01/715_302892.html,"In the 1880s, Lillias Underwood, an early American missionary in Korea, wrote:

 ""No matter how old one is, without a top-knot [a Korean] is never considered a man, addressed with high endings, or treated with respect. After assuming the top-knot, no matter how young, he is invested with the dignities and duties of a man of the family, takes his share in making the offerings and prayers at the ancestral shrines, and is recognized by his ancestors' spirits as one of the family who is to do them honor, and whom they are to protect and bless."" 

 Facial hair was also valued by Korean males. An American gold miner in the northern part of Korea recalled one of his Korean subordinates asking him for a page from his hometown newspaper. The page had an image of a full-bearded man and the Korean miner cut it out and pinned it to the wall of his room. Allegedly, he prayed ― either to the picture or to his own god ― to one day be granted a similar beard.

 With hair being so highly prized by the Korean male population it might surprise you to know that an 1885 patent request in the United States for ""a new and improved Hair-Cutting Machine"" had its origin in Jemulpo (modern Incheon). According to the inventor: ""The object of my invention is to provide a new and improved machine for clipping and cutting the hair on persons' heads, which is so constructed that it need not be operated by hand nor connected with exterior mechanism.""

 It probably comes as no surprise that the inventor wasn't Korean. He did, however, work for the Korean government: he was Vladimir S. Bekofsky, an employee of the Corean Customs Service and possibly the first Russian to live in Jemulpo.





Born in Archangel, Russia on July 15, 1845, at some point Bekofsky made his way to Vladivostok where he found employment as a marine engineer. Although the Russian port was relatively new, Bekofsky apparently thought he could make better money in Shanghai and eventually moved there at the beginning of 1883. 

 He appears to have had a rather adventurous spirit (along with a wife and two daughters to support) and when he learned the Korean government was establishing its own Customs Service, he immediately submitted his application ― carefully noting that he held ""a government certificate as an engineer theoretical and practical,"" ― and was promptly hired.

 In mid-June 1883, Bekofsky arrived in Jemulpo which, at this time, was mainly a collection of wooden shacks. He was placed in charge of construction and within two months had the Customs Service's foreign employees comfortably situated in new quarters. However, some of these employees were married and did not wish to be separated from their families ― including Bekofsky ― and soon began to move their families to the port. 

 In late September, Bekofsky's wife and two daughters arrived and took up residence in Hwato ― an area just outside of Jemulpo ― in, ironically considering his occupation, a dilapidated house that was later declared to be unhealthy. Unsurprisingly, his daughters found little to amuse them in Korea and apparently returned to Shanghai after spending only a short time in the primitive port.





Mrs. Bekofsky, however, elected to remain with her husband until the Gapsin Coup in December 1884 disproved the description of Korea being the ""Land of the Morning Calm."" Unrest in the capital and fear that it would spread, compelled the handful of Western women in the port to be removed to Nagasaki ― they did not return until late the following month. 

 When his wife returned, they moved into the General Foreign Settlement of Jemulpo where it was thought they would be free from the infrequent-violence and rampant disease. It also was closer to his office and gave him more time to tinker with his inventions.

 Not only did he invent the earlier-mentioned ""Hair Cutting Machine"" but also a car-coupler (for trains) in July 1886, a music recorder two months later and, in January 1887, a Balanced Cooking-Stove ― ""a practically balanced stove designed particularly for use on shipboard"" because it would ""always maintain a horizontal position, no matter to what extent the ship may roll."" 

 Shortly after inventing the Balanced Cooking-Stove, Bekofsky completed his contract with the Korean government and immigrated to New York with his family. Unfortunately, like many of these early sojourners, once he left Korea he disappeared from the pages of history.

Her white veil was found snagged on the door. An open bottle of water was leaking onto the tiles.

In the corner of the room was an ax.

Officers discovered the crime scene, described in court documents seen by CNN, at St. Pius X Convent Hostel in southern India on March 27, 1992.

Later that day, they found Sister Abhaya’s body in a nearby well at the Indian convent, in the city of Kottayam, Kerala.

A post-mortem examination revealed she had nail marks on both sides of her neck and two lacerated wounds on her head. Her body had multiple abrasions and she had sustained a fracture to her skull.

Despite her wounds and the kitchen crime scene, no one was brought to court over Sister Abhaya’s murder for 27 years. Instead, what followed was years of dead-end investigations, plagued with allegations of corruption.

Finally, last December, guilty verdicts were handed down to a priest and nun who had gone to extraordinary lengths to protect their illicit relationship. The court found Sister Abhaya had walked in on them while they were engaging a sex act in the kitchen, and killed her to conceal their sins. They were sentenced to life in prison.

After nearly three decades of fighting for justice, her family have one overriding question.

“Why did it take so long?” asks Sister Abhaya’s brother, Biju Thomas.

When she died, Sister Abhaya was a student at a local college run by the Knanaya Catholic Church in Kottayam, then home to about 1.8 million people.

Among India’s Hindu-majority population, 2.3% follow Christianity — a figure that hasn’t changed in more than two decades. But Kerala has a sizable Christian community, around 18% of its people.

According to India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which prosecuted the case, Sister Abhaya woke up at about 4:15am on the day of her murder to study for an exam.

She went to the ground floor kitchen to fetch some water and it was there prosecutors said she found Father Thomas Kottoor and Sister Sephy performing a sex act. Father Kottoor taught psychology at the school and Sister Sephy was in charge of the convent hostel where the act took place.

Prosecutors said the pair “maintained an illicit relationship”.

The night before the murder, prosecutors said the priest snuck onto the convent grounds and stayed in Sister Sephy’s room, which was on the ground floor of the hostel, near the kitchen.

When they realized the young nun had seen them in a compromising position, the pair hit her on the back of the head with a small ax kept in the kitchen, then threw her body into a well on the hostel grounds.

The details of what happened that night didn’t come to light until years later, after immense pressure from activists and the young nun’s family. Her father, in particular, refused to give up.

The first investigation into Sister Abhaya’s death was opened by the Kottayam West Police Crime Branch on the day her body was found. A year later, it concluded the cause of her death was suicide.

But Sister Abhaya’s father, Matthew Thomas, refused to accept their version of events and urged the CBI, the nation’s premier investigation agency, to take over the case.

They picked it up in 1993, but for 12 years did not charge anyone for her death. Instead, between 1993 and 2005, the CBI filed four reports, including three closure petitions, urging the Chief Judicial Magistrate to drop the case.

In their first report, they agreed with Kottayam police that the cause of death was “suicide by drowning.” However, it was not accepted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, and the case was reopened.

Their second report, published in 1996, was inconclusive — they could not determine if it was suicide or homicide. Investigators once again urged the case to be closed. This was once again rejected.

Their third report, published in 1999, stated it was a homicide but didn’t nominate any suspects. This was rejected as “unsatisfactory” by the Chief Judicial Magistrate.

Yet another report was filed in 2005, reiterating the case was “untraced,” as they could not identify any suspects. And once again, it was rejected by the Chief Judicial Magistrate.

After this, the investigation was transferred from the CBI New Delhi branch to the CBI in the southern city of Cochin in Kerala.

Finally, in 2009, the CBI formally charged Father Kottoor and Sister Sephy with murder, as well as another priest, Father Jose Poothrikkayil, who police said was involved in the killing.

All three denied the charge, as well as allegations of conducting an improper relationship.

They filed a dismissal request to get the case dropped, and it took another nine years before a judge ordered Father Kottoor and Sister Sephy to face trial. Charges against Father Poothrikkayil were dropped due to lack of evidence.

Prosecutors argued that Father Kottoor and Sister Sephy went to remarkable lengths to cover up their relationship and crime.

According to the CBI, Sister Sephy underwent hymenoplasty, a cosmetic fix to restore or reconstruct her hymen, the day before her arrest in 2008, to make it appear that she was still a virgin.

In court, prosecutors accused police officers from the Kottayam West Crime Branch of tampering with evidence and destroying documents crucial to the investigation.

“It is reasonable to suppose that Father Kottoor had at his control the immense resources of the diocese in terms of money and material, and could command the obedience of priests, nuns, and laymen,” the prosecution said.

Prosecutors alleged lead investigators, including the Superintendent and the Deputy Superintendent of the police, were instrumental in the cover up.

The judge agreed with the prosecution’s assertions that early police investigators fabricated and destroyed evidence, including the plastic bottle, Sister Abhaya’s slippers, and her white veil.

He ordered the state’s police head to ensure that “such misdeeds on the part of the police” do not occur in future.

Only one charge was made against an investigating officer, but that was dropped in 2008 after he died.

At least one other lead investigator from the Kottayam West Police Crime Branch, who was accused of fabricating and destroying evidence, also died before the case concluded.

“I have done no wrong. God is with me,” he told local reporters as he arrived in court on December 23 for the sentencing hearing.

His lawyer said the case relied entirely on circumstantial evidence. “There is no conclusive evidence,” said Father Kottoor’s lawyer, B. Sivdas. “And there was a delay in the investigation, a delay in finding the accused, there were so many loopholes. The court convicted them because the case became a sensation.”

Sister Abhaya — born Beena Thomas — was a “polite and quiet child,” according to her brother, Biju Thomas. They grew up in Kottayam, and were “devout Catholics and followers of Jesus Christ.”

“I remember when she was about five or six, she began taking a huge interest in God and the Bible,” said Thomas, now 51 and living in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. “She would read the Bible religiously, and take comfort in its teachings. Everyone loved her. She was always laughing.”

Sister Abhaya was 19 when she was “called to a religious life,” according to Thomas. The family had relatives in Germany and Italy who were also nuns. Thomas said that his sister admired the respect they received, and the work that they did.

“She wanted to be respected also, and devote her life to Jesus,” he said.

Thomas was 24 when he was told that his sister had died by suicide. “I was so confused because she was happy, and she was following her dream. Why would she have killed herself?” he said.

Thomas traveled back to Kottayam town, from the state of Gujarat where he was studying, to be with his family and take care of his sister’s funeral arrangements. Several days later, he visited her body in the morgue and read the postmortem report that revealed his sister had head injuries and nail marks to her neck.

“These to me showed that something had happened to her before she was thrown in the well,” he said.

Sister Sephy filed an eight-page written statement stating that Sister Abhaya suffered from “psychological depression.” She claimed that Sister Abhaya came from an “economically weak family and was not good enough in her studies.”

Some other nuns were “staunch upholders” of the suicide theory, according to the final judgment. They “endeavored to give all support to the accused,” the judgment said.

“It was very hurtful to hear those things said about my sister,” said Thomas. “She didn’t kill herself. She was silenced.”

Sister Abhaya’s father — a low-wage farmer — fought tooth and nail for his daughter, Thomas said.

“We were poor people, we didn’t have much money,” said Thomas. “But my father would travel for hours a day by bus to probe the police to reopen the case and give us the truth.”

“He suffered a lot,” said Thomas. “He always said ‘someone killed my Beena. I am sure of it’.”

Days after news broke of Sister Abhaya’s death, the suspicious nature of the case piqued the interest of a young activist, Jomon Puthenpurackal.

“When I heard details about (Sister Abhaya’s) case — the overturned fruit basket, the ax in the kitchen, her slippers in different positions — I knew immediately that something bad had happened to her,” said Puthenpurackal, who said he was inspired by Kottayam-based freedom fighter, K E Mammen, to “do good in the world.”

“I knew she hadn’t committed suicide, like the police and the Church said,” he said.

Puthenpurackal soon formed an Action Council to get justice for the murdered nun. He took a signed petition, along with Sister Abhaya’s father, to the CBI, detailing all the allegations of corruption and listing key witnesses.

Every time the CBI filed a petition to close the case, Puthenpurackal kept the pressure on, using the Indian media to keep the case in the public eye, and urging investigators to dig deeper.

There was one witness, in particular, who had testimony Puthenpurackal felt was key to convicting the case. Adacka Raju was a “thief by profession,” according to court documents. He had trespassed onto the hostel campus on the night of the murder to steal copper plates from the terrace, which he planned to sell, according to court documents.

Raju had stolen copper plates from the hostel twice before. But on his third attempt — the night of the murder — he told the court that he saw two men approaching the staircase. He identified one of them as Father Kottoor.

During the trial, defense lawyers vehemently argued against Raju’s version of events and sought to discredit him, by branding him untrustworthy and a “man of no integrity.” They also alleged that he was a witness planted by the prosecution.

The prosecution, however, said Raju was taken into custody by the Crime Branch and kept in the station for 58 days. He was subjected to “inhumane torture” by officers there, who tried to extract a confession to pin the murder on him.

“He stood his ground and did not budge even an inch,” according to the prosecution. “He was offered a substantial monetary reward and a job for his wife and the meeting of the educational expenses of his children and a house to live in, but he did not succumb to these blandishments.”

The police even arrested an acquaintance of Raju’s, and tortured him for two days, according to court documents seen by CNN. The judge stated that the acquaintance’s brother was also arrested and tortured for six days. He was repeatedly told to testify that Raju had committed Sister Abhaya’s murder.

“Raju faced many difficulties in coming forward,” said Puthenpurackal. “(The defense) completely dehumanized him. But he was one of the only witnesses who stood his ground, despite the mounting pressure.”

“I dedicated my life to this case and I wanted to see it through the end,” said Puthenpurackal, who continued to pursue the case even when it endangered his safety.

Father Kottoor threatened Puthenpurackal at a protest for Sister Abhaya. According to court documents, Father Kottoor warned Puthenpurackal that he would be “handled in the proper manner,” also pointing out that “no one working against the church had ever been spared.”

Because religious authorities in India are held in such high regard, victims often find it difficult to come forward if their perpetrators are involved with the church, according to the former president of the All India Catholic Union, John Dayal.

However, in recent years a number of victims in Kerala have come forward to seek justice.

In April 2019, Catholic Bishop Franco Mulakkal was charged with raping a nun multiple times between 2014 and 2016. A group of nuns who spoke against his alleged abuse claimed the church attempted to transfer them to other parts of the country, in a bid to silence them. Mulakkal, who is now based in the northern state of Punjab, has denied all allegations.

Former Catholic priest, Robin Vadakkumchery was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2019 for raping a 16-year-old girl in Kerala. The incident came to light only after the victim gave birth in February 2017.

The victim and her parents attempted to redirect focus away from the priest. Her father went as far as telling the court that he was the one who raped his daughter.

Sister Abhaya’s parents died in 2015, before their daughters’ attackers were brought to justice.

“I just wish my parents could have been here to see it happen,” said Thomas, Sister Abhaya’s brother. “That’s all they ever wanted.”

Thomas said he “can rest in peace” and move on with his life, now that the case is finally over.

However, he said he still struggles to reconcile his sister’s love for the church with the horror of what happened that night — and the fact that those who purported to share her faith were the ones who “took her away.”","She was murdered for catching an Indian priest and nun in a sex act.

The following night saw violent confrontations between groups of youths and the police in over a dozen working-class neighbourhoods across the country.

It wasn't initially clear what triggered them, and civilians and officials were deeply split over how best to describe them - were they protests or riots? And what were they really all about?

Some said they were caused by impoverished, hungry, and angry young people. More than 600 of them, mostly teenagers, were later arrested. The next day dozens of protestors came out in the centre of the capital, Tunis, against the arrests, reviving revolutionary chants calling for ""the fall of the regime"".

For 10 years, across the region, I have witnessed a lot of confusion and struggle. A sense of gain one day, matched by a sense of loss the next, and an inch of hope one year that is later engulfed by hopelessness, to varying degrees.

What Tunisia achieved in beginning its political and democratic transformation has not been matched by deeper economic and social development. The reality is that when former President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled from power, the economy tanked, and has not recovered since.

704,705,https://www.ridgecrestca.com/news/20210123/council-pledges-250k-year-for-pool,"The Ridgecrest City Council on Wednesday unanimously agreed to pledge roughly $250,000 annually for 30 years to support a proposed pool project. All five council members took part in the meeting, with Vice Mayor Solomon Rajaratnam participating via phone. The meeting was closed to in-person public attendance due to the COVID-pandemic.

The city is applying for a Statewide Park Development and Community Revitalization grant of up to $8.5 million for a new community pool to be built in the current Pinney Pool location. The project would involve completely removing the old facility and building a new one in the same place.

Projects must be located in a severely disadvantaged area.

The grant will be awarded in a competitive process, so approval is obviously not guaranteed. City support for operation and maintenance expenses is one requirement of the grant application that the council agreed to file. The application is due March 14, which is an extension of an earlier deadline.

If the city is unable to uphold the 30-year commitment, they may have to repay the grant according to Interim Parks and Rec Director Nerissa Wegener.

Pool expenses are roughly estimated at $350,000 per year according to consultant Counsilman-Hunsaker, who was originally tapped to advise on the pool project by the Indian Wells Valley Economic Development Corporation.

The pool is expected to bring in around $100,000 annually from fees collected from open swim, lessons, concessions, rentals, and so on, leaving the city's share at $250,000. Money would come from the city's general fund according to a staff report.

The plan includes a competition pool of 25 yards by 25 meters, a kiddie pool, shade, lighting, cameras, a snack bar with restrooms, showers and a multipurpose building according to Wegener.

Six community-based meetings have been held already, Wegener said. The next quality of life meeting will be on Feb. 2 and involve discussing design and layout.

Staff will update the council at the first meeting in March what the proposed design will look like.

Notice of awards will take place roughly five months after the application is received, Wegener said.

Ridgecrest has lacked a public pool since the much-loved Pinney Pool was closed as the result of an ADA-compliance lawsuit in 2017. Refurbishing Pinney Pool or building a new pool of some sort has topped the priority list of many community residents ever since.

Mayor Eric Bruen at the Rotary Club of China Lake Zoom meeting earlier the same day said that a new community pool was one of his top priorities during his term. See related story this edition for more.

U.S. health officials knew very little then about the mysterious new virus, and the quarantined group offered an early opportunity to size up the threat.The federal government sought help from a team at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, including Dr. James Lawler, an experienced infectious disease specialist. Lawler told Reuters he immediately asked the world-renowned U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for permission to test the quarantined group, deeming it crucial to know whether people without symptoms were infected and could spread the deadly pathogen.Agency officials worried that detained people couldn't give proper consent because they might feel coerced into testing. ""CDC does not approve this study,"" an official at the quarantine site wrote to Lawler in a Feb. 8 email obtained by Reuters. ""Please discontinue all contact with the travelers for research purposes.""More than two months passed before the CDC expanded its testing guidelines to include all asymptomatic people, saying soon afterward that this silent spread ""may meaningfully contribute to the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic."" By November, the agency estimated that more than half of cases were spread by people not currently experiencing symptoms.Critics have widely asserted that the CDC fumbled key decisions during the coronavirus scourge because then-President Donald Trump and his administration meddled in the agency's operations and muzzled internal experts. The matter is now the subject of a congressional inquiry. Yet Reuters has found new evidence thatAt a crucial moment in the pandemic when Americans were quarantined after possible exposure to the virus abroad,Soon after balking at testing the returnees from Wuhan,, Reuters found.""Yes, they were interfered with politically,"" said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, referring to alleged meddling by the Trump administration. ""But that's not the only reason CDC didn't perform optimally during COVID-19. There are a lot of things that went wrong.""Four top public health experts or ethicists told Reuters that the question of whether to test or engage in research on detained people has always been a sensitive topic. But all said the CDC should have proceeded given the fast-moving public health emergency.Moreover,. Informed consent means giving people adequate information to understand the risks and benefits of a test or procedure.Gostin said the CDC's argument against testing was ""unreasonable"" under the circumstances. ""You are asking for consent and not imposing any harm,"" he said. ""There is a good reason to do it.""It's difficult to know whether more aggressive early testing among asymptomatic people would have significantly altered the trajectory of the pandemic in the United States, which has infected 24 million people and killed more than 400,000.The CDC was not the only agency that struggled with this issue. Notably, an official with, only to say a day later ""we don't actually have that answer yet."" In recent months, the WHO has said infected people without symptoms can be contagious, but ""it is still not clear how frequently this occurs.""Still, some countries such as South Korea and Singapore used widespread testing early on to identify infected people with or without symptoms and, unlike the United States, broadly required or distributed masks.CDC scientists infamously botched the creation of a test for the coronavirus and took weeks trying to fix it, making widespread testing - well beyond those with symptoms - impossible during the pandemic's first months.In response to detailed inquiries from Reuters, a CDC spokesman said the agency declined to comment.In the final weeks of the Trump administration, White House officials did not respond to requests for comment on reports of political interference.The problems within, point to the steep challenge faced by newly inaugurated President Joe Biden and his CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, to rehabilitate the agency in the eyes of scientists, other public health officials and the public.Walensky ""acknowledges that work has to be done to restore public confidence"" in the CDC, according to a Biden spokesperson.Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, who worked at the CDC for 20 years and at one point was responsible for pandemic influenza preparedness, said the agency's staff are ""among the most dedicated professionals in the world and they were doing the best they could under the toughest circumstances.""""This has been an incredibly challenging pandemic and it would have been hard for anyone to guess what would have happened,"" she said.But she and other public health specialists also told Reuters that Americans deserve a thorough examination of the agency's shortcomings in the crisis.""We have to figure out what needs to be fixed before this happens again,"" said Rasmussen, now a professor at the University of Florida.On Feb. 7, a group of Americans arrived from Wuhan and the surrounding province at Camp Ashland, a National Guard base near Omaha and the University of Nebraska Medical Center, a major outpost in the nation's defenses against bioterrorism and infectious diseases.Infectious disease specialist Lawler, who worked in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations on pandemic response, suspected that some of the evacuees might be infected with the coronavirus and shedding it despite having no symptoms. His suspicions were based partly on scientific reports from Asia and Europe.Starting on Feb. 8, Lawler pressed the CDC to greenlight voluntary and limited coronavirus testing among this group, according to emails obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act.Lawler had already won support for such testing from the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) officials in charge of the returnees at Ashland, the Nebraska health department and his university's medical faculty, emails show. HHS oversees the CDC.Later that Saturday, Eric Kasowski, the CDC's representative at Camp Ashland, emailed Lawler to tell him that his request to test the 57 people in quarantine ""was very quickly elevated to Dr. (Anne) Schuchat, Principal Deputy Director, CDC,"" who had worked at the agency for 32 years.Schuchat referred questions from Reuters to the CDC press office, which declined to comment.The CDC's answer to Lawler was no.According to the Feb. 8 email: ""It is CDC's position that since the research is being proposed for a group of individuals who are detained under a federal quarantine order,.""Lawler said he kept pressing Kasowski. But Kasowski told Lawler the next morning that the testing proposal had been rejected again, this time by officials up to and including CDC director Robert Redfield.""This is absurd,"" Lawler recalled telling Kasowski.Kasowski declined to comment, referring questions to the CDC.Instead of having everyone tested during the two-week quarantine,In a Feb. 10 email to Kasowski, Lawler warned that the federal government, by not testing symptomless individuals, ""may be missing the submerged iceberg in the U.S.""Within days, Lawler got a new federal assignment: to help evacuate more than 300 Americans stranded on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan.He was joined there by Dr. Michael Callahan, a veteran infectious disease specialist from Massachusetts General Hospital, who had just been appointed a special advisor to HHS on COVID-19. Callahan, who says his two years of physician scientist training at the CDC in the mid-1990s inspired him to forgo academia for a field career battling disease outbreaks, had just treated coronavirus patients in China weeks earlier.Major problems emerged soon after Lawler and Callahan arrived in Yokohama on Feb. 14.The U.S. team, including HHS and other U.S. personnel, had to borrow walkie talkies from Japanese authorities because they didn't have mobile phones that worked internationally, according to an ""after-action"" report submitted by Lawler and Callahan in March to HHS and obtained by Reuters.According to Callahan, he had to turn back two CDC staffers seeking to board the Diamond Princess in Japan because they had no current experience in emergency medicine and infection control.Callahan said the problem was not isolated to the CDC's coronavirus response.The CDC needs ""people that can actually do public health when bad stuff happens,"" Callahan said.On Feb. 17, Lawler flew with 151 cruise passengers to Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, Texas. An isolation bubble was createdfor five passengers who had tested positive for COVID-19 in Japan.according to the after-action report.This likely put CDC personnel and other responders on the ground at risk.""What's more,, according to the report. The CDC official is not named in the report.in Northern California and a CDC officer boarded the plane, the report said.Meantime, officials at Nebraska's public health laboratory, who had been working with Lawler, asked the CDC for permission to test passengers from the Diamond Princess while they were under quarantine, even if they didn't have symptoms, emails show.A CDC influenza expert, Dr. Tim Uyeki, wrote back on Feb. 17 to the director of the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory that, citing a lack of detail on the accuracy of the Japanese tests.Uyeki declined to comment and referred questions to the CDC press office.Lawler and Callahan said they flew in late February to CDC headquarters in Atlanta to meet with Redfield and other senior officials, to raise concerns about the flawed evacuation and potential for asymptomatic spread based on their observations from the Diamond Princess.Lawler said CDC officials replied thatRedfield did not return requests for comment.Meanwhile, at both quarantine sites in Texas and California,, according to Dr. Bela Matyas, the local health officer in California's Solano County, as well as emails between the Nebraska hospital personnel and the CDC.The CDC officials had doubts about the accuracy of testing done by Japanese authorities, but the results confirmed thatDuring the second week of quarantine in late February, the CDC and local health officials began offering tests to all of the cruise passengers.Despite this evidence of infections without symptoms, the CDC made no immediate changes in its public guidance on asymptomatic infection.By March, signs of asymptomatic spread were mounting in the United States and abroad.A tipping point for the CDC came when staffers were deployed to the outskirts of Seattle to handle an outbreak at the Issaquah Nursing and Rehabilitation Center,. King County and CDC officials tested 76 of the 82 residents, regardless of whether they exhibited symptoms, beginning on March 13, according to the CDC.""That was really ... our first hint that asymptomatic transmission was fairly common, especially in those settings,"" said Dr. James Lewis, an official with the county health department's COVID-19 response, in an interview.Two weeks later, on March 27, the CDC published the case study as evidence of asymptomatic infection. That same week, for the first time, the agency recommended testing health workers and first responders, even without symptoms.In a radio interview that aired on March 31, Redfield said, ""We have learned that in fact"" symptomless individuals ""do contribute to transmission.""Based on that evidence, the CDC recommended that even asymptomatic people wear cloth face coverings in public areas. Almost a month later, on April 27, the agency expanded its testing guidelines to include ""persons without symptoms.""That was 11 weeks after Lawler's first request to test the Wuhan group in Nebraska.","A lack of expertise, funds, and inaction undermined the CDC's handling of the coronavirus --",www.sott.net

Caroline, Cosmo is still a mystical name that connects them across generations despite the passage of time.

Keeping it that way is not easy. Younger people have been moving away. The ancestral lands have shrunk as community members sold to real estate developers. The expansion of Jacksonville's suburbs took over the open woods that defined the Cosmo way of life for so long.

The older generation has sought to spread the word about Cosmo, but outside the tight-knight community, Cosmo is not nearly as well-known as Timucuan Indians and French Huguenot settlements in a part of Jacksonville where history runs deep.

Called Freedom Park, it's on a triangle-shaped piece of land where Ft. Caroline and McCormick roads intersect, a gateway junction into the area where Cosmo began as a land grant to freed slaves.

Cosmo community member Floyd Key, 72, said Freedom Park can be a way to pass the torch to a younger generation.

""It means everything,"" he said. ""The history is kind of slipping away, but we are trying to bring it back to teach the younger kids and the younger generation what this place means to us.""

The Freedom Park parcel had been vacant since the Jacksonville Transportation Authority demolished a small strip shopping center as part of the Wonderwood Connector project.

It's not a large piece of land, but ""it's a big idea,"" said City Council member Al Ferraro, who worked with Mayor Lenny Curry and state lawmakers to get the park funded and built.

The design of the park will have a two-fold purpose: It will honor veterans living with the toll of post-traumatic stress disorder, and it will commemorate the Cosmo community.

""Yes, it's taken several years for this to happen, but it never is too late,"" said Preston Oliver, 75, who lives on the city's Westside now but grew up in Cosmo. ""It's not something that I could ever forget about, regardless of whether I live here or not. There's so many memories here.""

Some aspects of Cosmo have been lost. The one-room schoolhouse from a century ago is long gone. There are no historic houses that could be restored to show what life was like when Cosmo was a self-contained community. No one knows why ""Cosmo"" became the community's name.

But recent genealogical research has helped flesh out how Cosmo fits currents of Jacksonville history. Some of the original settlers were freed slaves who came from Kingsley Plantation on the other side of the St. Johns River, a finding that helps stitch Cosmo into the broader tapestry of the Timucuan Preserve.

After emancipation, the federal government made land grants to African-Americans across the South. The heart of Cosmo was 40 acres of land deeded to James Bartley in 1877 in an area that at the time was accessible only by boat.

The history of Cosmo also fits an ongoing effort by the National Park Service to tell the story of the Gullah Geechee people whose roots go back to West and Central Africa when they were enslaved and brought to Southeast Atlantic plantations like Kingsley Plantation.

Congress created the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor in 2006 covering coastal areas in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida all way south to St. Johns County.

Part of what makes Cosmo so fascinating is seeing how the community has persisted for generations, said Ted Johnson, community engagement specialist for the National Park Service at the Timucuan Preserve.

""It's an opportunity to learn how a community like this can still be thriving, and we learn from them the key elements that keep them together — love for one another, sisterhood, brotherhood, nurturing the youth,"" he said.

""The root belief, the integrity, has lasted,"" he said. ""There are other Gullah Geechee communities I'm learning about in the city that have been very successful at keeping those values together.""

Passing those values from one generation to the next was easier when the Cosmo community was a self-contained community with families of all ages living near each other and even under the same roof.

Back then, the Cosmo way of life was hunting, fishing and farming. Children learned how to skin raccoons and butcher hogs. Farms produced a wide array of crops including sugar cane. Everyone pitched in.

""When you came home from school, you had work to do,"" said Joney Kearse, 64.

But the outdoors was full of opportunities for free time before the evening call brought everyone back indoors.

""I remember being a little boy before all the houses, and it was all woods out here,"" said Wilbert Anderson Jr., 64, who lives on the Northside but still considers himself part of Cosmo. ""We used to be out here playing and running around, and it was just fun to be down here.""

""You could sit outside and see a car go by and you knew whose car it was,"" said Michael Cooper, 63, who lives in Cosmo off Ft. Caroline road. ""Now, it's like, hey, we've been here all the time. Why are you looking at me like that? You're the new guy.""

He said Cosmo always has had a strong religious foundation and that's been key to keeping the community together.

""Everybody here is related to a preacher somehow,"" he said. ""I think that has a lot to do with it.""

Two historic buildings that remain are churches along Ft. Caroline Road. Church of the Living God, Pillar of the Living Truth was founded in 1935. Alexander Memorial United Methodist Church was built in 1900 and is the spiritual base for Cosmo.

Community members credit the late Rev. E. Delores Demps with pushing the vision for a park. Demps, the daughter of a Cosmo fisherman, died in March 2017 so she didn't live long enough to see the construction of Freedom Park. But she was active in the Cosmo Historical Preservation Association, a group that meets monthly.

""She wanted us to know our history before she left here,"" said Curley Key, 70. ""She started spreading the word. She was going everywhere and doing everything for the history.""

Old Arlington Inc. worked with the group to install a marker in front of the Methodist church in 2009. Signs went up along a stretch of Ft. Caroline Road saying ""Welcome to Cosmo, Florida"" and identifying it as a Gullah Geechee community. But the signs might raise more questions than they answer.

""A lot of people see the Gullah Geechee signs and they probably have no clue about Cosmo,"" said community member Lee White, 53. ""None at all.""

When Ferraro ran for City Council in 2015, he talked with Demps about her push for a museum and a park. Ferraro was no stranger to Cosmo or the Demps family. He grew up in the same area of Jacksonville and went to school with Demps' children. Cosmo community members still were selling fresh produce from their farms.

""The whole area was different,"" Ferraro said. ""It was like a little Mayberry at one time. We all knew each other.""

Ferraro explored the idea of a museum but decided to focus on a park because it was more realistic to get that done during his City Council tenure.

In 2019, the state Legislature approved $521,000 to pay for creating the park to recognize veterans and the Gullah Geechee by building a gateway entry feature to Ft. Caroline National Memorial that's a few miles away.

The construction of the park and its paved walking trails is complete, but the city still needs to install markers to honor veterans and Cosmo. Ferraro is working on a plan to plant trees along one side of Ft. Caroline Road from Freedom Park toward Ft. Caroline National Memorial to link them together.

Ferraro said when school children go to Ft. Caroline Memorial on field trips, they can learn about Cosmo in the same way they do the Timucuan Indians and the early settlements by France and Spain.

""It's telling the story in a much broader way so it tells the whole story,"" he said.

Life-long Cosmo resident Doris White, 77, said Freedom Park is a way to show how a community has stuck together in the face of changes.

""I hope they come away understanding that this is our history, and we've just been here a long time,"" she said. ""We want them to see what's been going on.""",Commemorating Cosmo: New Jacksonville park highlights community founded by freed slaves,www.jacksonville.com

The claims, made yesterday by wine importers, come as fishing firms warned of impending bankruptcy and retailers said they might burn clothes held in the EU, after being returned from European customers, because of customs charges.

The Financial Times quoted wholesaler Daniel Lambert as saying new export documents for wine leaving the EU, plus a 30 to 50 per cent increase in haulage costs, would push up prices on the shelves and reduce the range available.

Mr Lambert said: ‘On a top-quality wine, it could easily be £2, but on the stuff retailing for £12 you’ll see £1 across the board. It will be less on a £3.50 bottle of supermarket wine, but I don’t really count that as wine.’

Mr Gove, one of the architects of Brexit and the Minister most closely involved in the transition, is a particular fan of red wine.

But a source close to the Minister for the Cabinet Office said: ‘There may be some additional costs and processes but there are a lots of excellent-value wines available in UK markets and there will continue to be. A lot of wine is from outside the EU, too.’

About 28 million British consumers drink wine at least once a month, according to research group Wine Intelligence, with the UK importing £2.2 billion worth of wine from the EU each year.

Last night, Labour MPs rounded on Mr Gove for the prospective price rise. Tonia Antoniazzi, MP for Gower, said: ‘Lots of people will be feeling like they were sold a vintage bottle only to find it corked on arrival.

'Thanks to Michael Gove, it will be even more expensive for people to drown their sorrows during lockdown due to red tape and higher import costs as a result of his Brexit deal.’

Rupa Huq, MP for Ealing Central and Acton, added: ‘The barrier-less friction-free trade that Gove and chums promised was complete fantasy. Brexit at best has been a glass half-empty situation. I’m livid, and I say that as a teetotaller.’

Fishing bosses in Scotland have accused the Scottish government of not doing enough to ensure their produce could continue to reach the Continent.

The sector has struggled to cope with leaving the EU, with additional customs checks and tariffs costing millions of pounds in lost business.

Scottish salmon suffered a £3 million loss in the first week of January, while several small exporters have been pushed to the brink.

The source close to Mr Gove said the Government had taken ‘swift action’ to resolve issues arising from the UK’s exit from the EU single market and the customs union, and that ‘such significant change would inevitably cause some turbulence’.

The source added: ‘Despite the doom-mongering and predictions of chaos at the border, disruption has so far been minimal.

‘Thanks to the efforts of traders and hauliers, turnbacks at the border are averaging just around five per cent each day. For example, on Tuesday this week about 5,000 HGVs crossed the Channel, with flow at around 70 per cent of normal levels.’",Post-Brexit hiccups 'will add £1.50 to a bottle of fine wine',www.dailymail.co.uk

More than 6.3 million vaccines have been given in the UK so far, with 5.9 million of these first doses, with those aged over 70, health and social care workers and clinically extremely vulnerable people highest in the priority list.

The Sun reported Bellfield, serving two whole life orders for the murders of Marsha McDonnell, Amelie Delagrange and Milly Dowler, has been told he and other inmates at Frankland Prison, County Durham, could be vaccinated in the coming weeks.

Priority for the vaccines has been determined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, with everyone over 70 and clinically extremely vulnerable people all planned to get a first dose by February 15.

The Ministry of Justice tweeted: “The NHS is legally required to vaccinate prisoners in eligible cohorts, such as those over 80, in line with guidance. Prisoners will not receive the vaccine ahead of their cohort.

“To suggest prisoners are being treated any differently to the general public is completely untrue.”

Bellfield, 52, was given a whole life term for murdering Ms McDonnell, 19, in 2003, and murdering Ms Delagrange, 22, and attempting to murder Kate Sheedy, 18, in 2004.

He was already serving this sentence when he went on trial accused of killing Milly, who was snatched from the street while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002.

The party’s co-leader Lorna Slater welcomed president Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris taking office in the US, and their appointment of former American secretary of state John Kerry to take the lead on climate change policy.

Mr Kerry has said the inauguration of Mr Biden marked the start of the “road to Glasgow” and the Cop26 United Nations environment summit in November, which he said would set “a floor, not a ceiling” in the fight against climate change.

President Biden also signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris climate agreement on his first day in office.

Ms Slater called on the Scottish and UK governments to increase their own green targets before the global summit, saying current ambition is “entirely inadequate”.

She said: “Hosting the global climate summit is a huge opportunity for both governments to demonstrate a desire to go further and faster than ever before.

“Instead, these governments are ploughing ahead with road expansion schemes, supporting continued oil exploration, airport expansion and even, in the case of the UK Government, supporting the opening of a new coal mine.

“The Scottish Greens have shown how we can change our infrastructure spending priorities to tackle the climate crisis and create good jobs as part of a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis.

“Our rail for all programme would modernise Scotland’s railway, making it affordable and accessible to all. The Scottish Government shows no such ambition.”

Climate Change Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “Scotland is already leading the world on tackling the twin crises of climate change and ecological decline. We have the single most ambitious legal framework for emissions reduction in the world and, in December, updated our Climate Change Plan with over 100 new policies to help us achieve a just transition to net zero by 2045.

“Our commitment is unwavering and is central to our green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.

“We fully recognise the responsibility we have of welcoming COP26 to Scotland.

“This year will be a critical time for securing ambitious international and national climate commitments and, critically, translating these into demonstrable actions.

“We are committed to playing our full part in securing those commitments in the lead up to, and during, COP26.

“In addition, Cop26 is an opportunity to showcase Scotland’s world-leading approach to reducing emissions and ensuring a just transition, where no one is left behind and in the spirit of international solidarity, taking the novel approach of publishing an indicative Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), reflecting Scotland’s contribution to the Paris Agreement.

“By highlighting our own action, we aim that others will follow our lead in setting such ambitious targets and moving to a fairer and net zero world.”","We must increase climate ambitions now US is back on track, say Greens",www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk

This closed beta is getting a staggered launch and the first wave of invites has already been sent out to Resident Evil ambassadors. RE: Verse will act as Resident Evil Village’s multiplayer content akin to Resident Evil 3 Remake’s Project Resistance. Resident Evil 3 Remake is available right now for Xbox One, PS4, and PC.

The RE: Verse closed beta will apparently take place at various times starting January 27th until January 29th. During the closed beta, Resident Evil fans can only play during specific sessions so players will have to keep their eyes peeled on when the sessions will be live. Just because someone is a Resident Evil ambassador also doesn’t guarantee them a code, so currently the first wave of invites seems a little random, but by the end of the closed beta, it’s likely that all Resident Evil ambassadors will get a chance to play.

Resident Evil ambassadors at a higher rank will apparently receive their RE: Verse codes sooner, suggesting the most seasoned fans will be checking out the new multiplayer experience first. Resident Evil fans who purchase RE Village when it releases will automatically get access to RE: Verse, but the closed beta process will help iron out any bugs or other issues that may arise ahead of its release. With the staggered release of a closed beta, it may be fair to assume an open beta or demo will release for all Resident Evil fans to enjoy down the road ahead of Village’s release.

Alao-Akala, who is the Chairman, Elders Advisory Council of the Oyo State All Progressives Congress, made the call in an interview with journalists shortly after an expanded meeting of the APC, held on Saturday at his Awosika, Ibadan residence.

The former governor said a meeting of Council of State, comprising of all former governors of the state, both military and civilian, was necessary to save Oyo State from total collapse in terms of security.

Alao-Akala said, “Governor Seyi Makinde needs help in the area of maintaining law and order in the polity. Hence, he should not shy away from that fact.

“He needs to sit down and brainstorm with people who have been there before him to share from their wealth of experience on how certain things are done, especially in the area of security.

“Take for instance, at the national level, the President meets periodically with former Heads of State and former Presidents and all former Chief Justices, among others, at the Nigerian Council of State meeting to review activities of government and seek advice and interventions where need be.

“This is exactly what Governor Makinde needs in Oyo State at the moment. The peace and stability of the state is a collective responsibility of all. We are all stakeholders in the Oyo State project.”

The former governor said there were seasoned, well-trained retired generals who were military administrator of the state while as well as former civilian governors that Makinde could approach for help.

Alao-Akala said, “Part of the duties of the Council of State is also to offer advice whenever they are requested to do so on the maintenance of public order within the federation and any part thereof and in such other matters as may be desired.

“So, Governor Seyi Makinde will very much be in order if he convenes this strategic meeting because a stitch in time saves nine.”

He said there was the need to tackle COVID-19 with all seriousness, noting that non- compliance to safety protocols had been identified as a huge challenge to curbing the spread of the virus.

Ganduje said the state government had held a meeting with relevant agencies to find a template on how the compliance would be enforced.

“Enforcement of compliance with COVID-19 protocols would soon come up in the state. People should comply for the health of the citizenry.

“The state task force on COVID-19 held a meeting with security agencies to embark on the enforcement to ensure that members of the society do comply for optimum result,” he said.

The governor said that the vanguards would include security agencies, the paramilitary and non-governmental organisations.

He called on the mass media to continue to enlighten the public on the dangers of the pandemic.

“We are very happy that you are cooperating with the state government in this fight,” he said.

The pledge was made towards the $1bn ECOWAS Regional Security Fund set up in 2019 but the amount so far contributed to the fund could not be confirmed immediately.

The Ghanaian President and Chairman of the ECOWAS Authority, Nana Akufo-Addo disclosed this during the virtual summit of the 58th ordinary session of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government held on Saturday.

He said the FG pledged to contribute $100m in the first instance last year, out of which $20m would go to the regional fund while $80m would be utilised to combat terrorism in the North-East.

Akufo-Addo noted that raising the $1bn fund in support of the 2020-2024 Anti-Terrorism Action Plan has to be a high priority for the ECOWAS, adding that the body was awaiting confirmation of transfer instructions.

He stated that the West African Economic and Monetary Union countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte D’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) had committed to contribute $500m while Nigeria pledged $350m, leaving $150m for the six remaining countries and other sources.

The SDP, in a statement by its Chairman in Kwara State, Lekan Alabi, noted that the APC had been embroiled in crisis since coming to power in 2019.

According to him, the crisis in the APC had distracted the APC-led government from delivering on its mandate.

“The SDP, therefore, wishes to sympathise with the good people of Kwara State and the genuine progressives in the All Progressives Congress, who are unwillingly entangled in the mess, and indeed all lovers of true democracy to come and team up with us in an effort to rescue the downtrodden from the clutches of pseudo-progressives masquerading as lovers of the people.”

The SDP however called on the state governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, to put structures in place for the conduct of local government election.

Meanwhile, a group within the APC, ‘Global Like Minds Movement’, has called on aggrieved party members to make known their demands the state governor.

The group’s coordinator, Alhaji Omar Aiyelabegan, said, “It’s an open fact that our party, APC, is facing crisis and we don’t want that type of crisis to continue, because it is being perpetuated by political job seekers and people who want to benefit out of the current unpleasant situation. That is why we want to put the record straight.”

718,719,https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2021/01/23/315237-n315237,"Looks like the FBI is going to great lengths to track down anyone who was near the Capitol on Jan. 6.

How do we know this? Because apparently anyone who had a cell phone in the vicinity of the Capitol on that date is getting a visit from the FBI if their cellphones pinged off a cell tower around that time on that date, according to WUSA9.

Bree Stevens explained how they questioned her.

“Extremely creepy, because he explained that they have everyone’s phone number from pinging off the cell phone towers, and they know basically exactly where you were, within the vicinity of the Capitol,” Stevens said. “And they can actually pinpoint on Google Maps exactly where you were standing. Like, he knew where I was standing on the sidewalk, like specifically, based on my cell phone ping.” Stevens said the agent told her she wasn’t a suspect, but said he wanted pictures of things she might have seen.

WUSA notes that some “civil rights advocates” are concerned about the surveillance powers being employed, but that the FBI refused to discuss how they came about their information.

What likely happened is they got an order that is allowing them to pick up anyone in the area and yes, that should be concerning, because it’s not specifically tailored to suspects, it’s a broad dragnet. This is also largely over misdemeanor charges of illegal entry although obviously there were other charges potentially, such as those involving assault.

It appears some of the folks who may have been nailed because of their cellphones didn’t pay attention to the advice of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) who advised ‘protesters’ during the summer either not to carry their cellphones or to turn them to airplane mode and disabling the data.

So from a legal point of view, some of the illegal entry charges may have difficulty because some of the people who entered appear to have been allowed in by the Capitol Police, although obviously others were not.

It also stands to reason that the FBI is going to concentrate on the more serious cases, the ones that actually involved violence or damage, which may explain why they’re saying they may not charge some 800 people who were not involved in that, according to The Washington Post.

But it is also interesting to note, where was all this investigatory ability when there were violent riots across the country, with BLM/Antifa folks attacking the state/federal governments with explosives, trying to burn things down and attacking law enforcement officers? Did they not employ any of those techniques to track down the Antifa crew who did some pretty violent things?

721,722,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/focus/2021/01/24/how-one-us-hospital-is-not-coping,"IN one day, we lost three patients in the intensive care unit due to complications related to severe Covid-19 pneumonia.

The patients who died were 45,53 and 73 years old. All three had been on life support for more than four weeks and had developed multiple complications, including other infections with resistant bacteria, bleeding, acute kidney failure and shock. All three patients were on maximum ventilator support, and there were no more ways to give them more oxygen.

St Anthony Hospital is a “safety net” facility on Chicago’s Southwest Side that serves low-income and vulnerable populations. As with many hospitals across the United States, the number of deaths related to Covid-19 at St Anthony is accelerating, as more patients who were admitted a few weeks ago with respiratory failure and placed on mechanical ventilators are reaching the end of the road.

This virus is relentless. It attacks the body in different ways, and kills using different strategies. It is a smart and cunning virus. We have not seen anything like it in our lifetime.

One of the most demanding tasks in the intensive care unit is to call families and share with them the progression of the disease affecting their loved ones. We answer their questions, make sure they understand the gravity of the situation and tell them that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) will not help to bring life to the patient when their heart stops beating.

The conversation is often a rollercoaster of emotions. They are not physically present to see their loved ones. They can FaceTime and see the pale faces of their family members connected to all kinds of tubes and catheters. But many times, these new ways of communication do not do justice to the gravity of the situation.

Some families accept the information. When there is no hope, they make the hard decision to not resuscitate their family member. Others want “everything to be done” until the heart stops beating. Some get angry or very emotional no matter what we say.

The 73-year-old patient had been on life support for 31 days. Her organs had been failing. Her family wanted “everything” to be done to keep her heart beating. An hour after the call, her heart stopped. We “coded” her. We pressed on her chest 100 times per minute knowing that CPR wouldn’t bring her to life, but we respected the family’s decision. We gave her injections of epinephrine to stimulate the heart and circulation, trying to jump-start her heart. We could not. We pronounced her dead and informed the grieving family. The young nurse attending to her was crying. She was tired and devastated, but she still had to take care of three other critically ill patients who needed nursing care.

Six more patients were waiting in the emergency room to be admitted to the ICU. All of them were suffering from severe Covid-19 and may end up on life support. Some will survive the virus, and some won’t.

We ran out of beds and are about to run out of ventilators. We are using old, portable ventilators that do not have the bells and whistles found in newer, more expensive machines. We have to; there are no other options.

The situation is overwhelming. Sometimes, I feel that I am in disaster-stricken Yemen or Syria, not in the United States.

In another bed, we have a father who is only 59 years old with multiple organ failure. His prognosis looks very grim. He is dying. His daughter, who is only 31 years old, was just intubated in ta different room. She has severe Covid-19 pneumonia and is not doing well. We called a nearby medical centre that has more advanced technology to see if they would help give the younger patient a higher chance of survival. They initially refused. They said that they had “reached their cap” (full capacity). We begged them to transfer the patient to their facility. She needed a higher level of care than we could provide.

Only a few medical centres in Chicago have the advanced technology, and almost all of them refuse to take patients due to the large number of Covid-19 patients they already have. I understand their logic, but it is not right or fair. Why should your area code determine whether you will have a better chance of living?

The nearby centre finally agreed, and we transferred the young patient. We cried in celebration. We prayed that she would live. Her family was very appreciative.

To build resilience, my global health team teaches local frontline healthcare workers about the principles of dealing with limited resources in war-torn countries such as Syria and Yemen, and fragile states such as Sierra Leone and Bangladesh. The austere environment is the rule not the exception in some of these regions. I never imagined that we would be using the same principles in my hospital in Chicago.

A century ago, the United States lost about 675,000 patients to the influenza pandemic. That was before the invention of antiviral medications and modern ICUs. We are expected to lose more patients during this pandemic.

We are failing. Everyone should share the blame, from former President Donald Trump to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to those who have politicised mask-wearing, to those who continue to gather in house parties, to the bikers who gathered in the tens of thousands in South Dakota. We should reflect on that as a society and draw some lessons for the future.

With the start of vaccinations, we see the light at the end of a long tunnel. It is still too early to celebrate, though. It will take a lot of effort and convincing of the 40% of the population who are sceptical of the vaccine. That should be our priority. We need to vaccinate at least 70% of the population to stop the pandemic and get our normal life back. Until then we should not lower our guard.

We can either tolerate wearing a mask for the time being and take the vaccine when it is available, or we will have to live with the collective guilt of squandering another opportunity to win the battle against this virus. – Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service

The charges have been filed nearly after 18 years after the three were captured in Thailand and have been held at Guantanamo Bay wartime prison since September 2006.

The Pentagon announced the charges two days after US new Defence Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III told Congress that the administration ""does not intend to bring new detainees to the facility and will seek to close it.""According to a statement by Pentagon, the first terrorist who has been charged is Riduan Isamuddin, better known by his nom de guerre Hambali, the leader of Indonesian jihadist group Jemaah Islamiyah and believed to have been Al-Qaeda's top representative in the region.

The other two terrorists charged, Malaysian nationals Mohammed Nazir bin Lep and Mohammed Farik bin Amin, were top Hambali aides in Jemaah IslamiyahThe charges alleged they ""aided and abetted in a course of conduct that resulted in the bombing of nightclubs in Bali, Indonesia in 2002 and the bombing of a J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2003"".

In 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, 202 people including 7 Americans were killed and 11 people were killed, 80 suffered injuries in 2003 Marriott hotel bombing in Jakarta.

The charges include conspiracy, murder, attempted murder, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, terrorism, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, destruction of property, all in violation of the law of war, according to the statement.

According to Pierini, the Turkish appeal's court could not have chosen a worse time to overturn the acquittal in the case of businessman Osman Kavala and a number of other civil society figures in the Gezi case.

Turkey abandoned a certain defense architecture in NATO many years ago, Pierini said, turning instead to Russia's S-400 air defense systems.

Moreover, Turkey obstructed Europe’s defense architecture and is perceived as a very unlikely opportunity to return to a purely NATO position. So the Europeans should worry about that, the ambassador said.

Referring to the statement by EU diplomacy chief Josep Borrell in the European Parliament (EP) on the need for actions from Ankara, Pierini said the EP will not allow significant progress in relations with Turkey without some changes in the field of human rights and the rule of law, because this is the nature of a democratic society.

He presents with serious and complex mental health, medical and disability needs. He has level-three functioning autism, sensory processing disorder, speech language impairment, dysgraphia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, severe and extreme anxiety, depression which now indicates suicidal tendencies, frequent challenging behaviour, eosinophilic oesophagitis (an immune disorder), mild dysphagia, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with enteral tube feeding, eczema and a delayed onset of puberty with a halt in linear growth.

Translated, that means he can present as a challenging and complex student, but history proves that when schools, principals and teachers are on his side, he can fly … academically, socially and behaviourally.

But when schools fail him, it's Kobe that bears the brunt of their incompetence.

While the secondary school that excluded him from his education 18 months ago carries on as normal, Kobe is still suffering from PTSD caused by his mistreatment. Worst of all, that trauma means his educational journey is now officially over. He can no longer face the classroom, having lost trust in the teachers and educators who were meant to help him.

Despite achieving high marks in mainstream subjects at his former school, and previously hoping to engage in vocational training, his family say his future job prospects are now limited thanks to the abrupt and unfair end to his school days.

And it's just not good enough.

Sarah is not just Kobe's mother and advocate, but a teacher herself. For more than 20 years she has worked within Education Queensland, she knows her rights, she knows Kobe's rights and she knows how to fight the system.

Yet still, she failed.

And that, along with worry about her son's future, is what keeps her up at night.

If her son has been left traumatised, broken and limited by the education system, even with a passionate and wise warrior fighting his corner, what hope have other parents and students?

It's the reason that she faced the Royal Commission into Disability last year, hoping to illuminate the failings of the system before it failed even more children.

But she fears that is not enough. With rates of homeschooling soaring and desperate pleas for help from parents on social media ASD forums, she can only imagine it's going to get worse before it gets better.

But as Kobe well knows, she'll never quit.

""In a state where all students have the right to an education that suits their needs, and where every student should have the opportunity to succeed and have a life of choice rather than chance, the state is letting my son down.

""I am now left with a son whose regression is so severe that I cannot put good faith in the Education Queensland school system. It is broken.

""Now my son and our family have been broken because of this, but we are not the ones that began broken. The school tried to make my son change - in ways not possible of him due to disability and other serious complex needs - to fit their environment.

""They did not change their ways to meet and support his disability. When a flower doesn't bloom you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.

""Yes, my son is bright, but bright is not to be confused with autistic. It is disgusting to be told by educators, 'he is bright, he can work things out, he'll get by' and 'he is bright, he will be so successful as an adult'.

""Would you deem it acceptable for an individual who is hearing impaired to be told, 'you can see, you can read, you're bright, you'll get by'? Or to tell an individual who is vision impaired, 'you can hear, you're bright, you'll get by'?

""Would it be OK to not give them the support they need because they too are bright? No, because it's discriminatory.""

Sarah is the first to admit that Kobe's condition is difficult, but it is not unmanageable.

In fact, at another school, he was given an award for his behaviour, had only half-a-dozen incidents, which were controlled, and he excelled in mainstream classes.

Sarah says because he had progressed so well at his former school, she thought it would be beneficial to educate him closer to their family home.

""Kobe requires significant one-to-one support at all times. He demonstrates rigid thinking and poor communication skills, he misinterprets verbal and non-verbal cues and needs frequent guidance, time and patience,"" she says.

""He often has sensory overload which can result in being overstimulated which increases his anxiety which then also leads to meltdowns. He can also present with disruptive and challenging behaviours because he's trying to avoid the trigger that's created the anxiety. He has persecutory thoughts which can often lead to him being unsafe.

""Despite all this, he had his best schooling year ever when he transitioned to high school - even with all the changes that involved.

""Kobe had had such a successful year in Year 7, he developed some skills of independence, co-regulation, he was doing well academically with the right supports and socially he made huge advances.

""The highlight, I guess, that year for Kobe was he was invited to his first ever birthday party, which happened to be at Movie World theme park. That is a very sensory overloading place for Kobe, but the friendship group meant so much to him that he worked really hard to overcome those barriers. Obviously, I was with him for support, hanging back to allow him to be with his friends, and that was a huge achievement and just amazing for his self-esteem.

""I was hopeful that Kobe, with his newly developed skills would be able to make some friends at his new school that would live in our local area so that he could go and hang out with a friend or have a friend over without having to travel long distances. And obviously it would be great to investigate employment opportunities within our local community.""

However, the decision to move schools proved tragic for Kobe.

Despite detailed and explicit planning with his new school, Sarah says almost immediately the new teachers and the principal failed to follow the guidelines.

""At his previous school, Kobe's teachers were very understanding - they tried to understand his disability, they tried to understand his limitations and they tried to understand and work with his strengths.

""I believe his first year of high school was so successful because of the planning that was put in place and the staff's ability to be able to follow those plans.

""Because Kobe could then trust them, he knew that he was in a safe space - and the lesser his anxiety, the better his behaviour.

""Before he started at his new school, I spoke at length with the head of the special education program about Kobe's needs and was assured that they had the capability to manage them. I provided them with all of Kobe's support documents and plans from his previous school.

""Initially, Kobe seemed to have transitioned OK. He was attending mainstream classes for most subjects with English and math in the special education program. Although I had requested Kobe have an aide with him to transition and move around the school and provide support for him in these classes, he did not receive it.

""His anxiety began to heighten and despite trying to cope and prove to everyone he could manage, he could not. From the beginning of week four he began attending at reduced hours.

""Still not receiving any additional support, Kobe's anxiety continued to grow. He began requesting extra water be given to him through his PEG, a strategy he uses to manage his anxiety, and exiting classes.

""It was at this point that I knew my son was not coping because he was not receiving the support he required. I requested a Complex Needs Case be opened and a submission to the Department of Education be made for additional funding. I was met with no reply.""

In fact, it took more than nine months for the school to engage support and advice from the department.

Meanwhile, Kobe's behaviour deteriorated as his anxiety and stressors increased.

In his first year at the school, despite not even attending full time, the number of recorded incidents involving Kobe increased from six at his previous school to 47.

Despite pleading for meetings with all stakeholders and insisting that Kobe's Inclusion Support Program (ISP) be followed, she was denied both. Both Sarah and Kobe were growing increasingly distraught by the number of suspensions and incidents occurring.

""While I did not condone my son's behaviour on numerous occasions, I was aware that under Education Queensland policy that if a student's plan is not followed by staff and behaviour occurs as a result, then the student cannot be suspended. Yet Kobe was.

""It was also very apparent upon examining Kade's ISP closely that it was breached numerous times. His ISP included 'do not chase' and 'avoid discussion when heightened' and triggers included 'new/changed routines'. These were all ignored.

""I felt that they were punishing him for his behaviour rather than understanding the reason for it and proactively trying to find and put preventions and solutions in place to prevent the behaviour.

""His anxiety was through the roof. His education was declining because he was rarely in class. He wasn't coping because he wasn't getting the support that he needed, and he began fleeing from classrooms. So his anxiety increased. His behaviour escalated and frequent meltdowns ensued.

""He had teachers following him into alleged safe spaces while making comments such as 'do you get this behaviour from home?', 'I'm sick of you' and 'You're just attention seeking'.

""After one suspension, Kobe was brought back to school and as soon as I left he was told his timetable was changed. He was taken into a classroom of Year 7 students and segregated from them. He asked if he could sit with them and the teacher said 'no'.

""He was confused, upset, distressed. Kobe doesn't cope with transitions and change that has been a regular and routine part of his life since he was two years old.

""Even his case manager was constantly changing.

""Kobe had four case managers just in 2018. The second one was instrumental in where things started to take a turn for the worse, they continually broke the plans. They didn't understand the function of Kobe's behaviour. They labelled him and called him 'a bad, bad boy', something that still resonates with him on a daily basis.""

Sarah says Kobe's education essentially ended after an incident which was, once again, mismanaged.

She says Kobe was triggered by deliberate noise from another child and the two students had a physical altercation.

She says Kobe was escorted into a quiet space by a teacher but denied access to his laptop, a change he was not aware of - another contravention of his ISP.

""That unexpected change was ultimately a trigger that caused Kobe to become very distressed and highly volatile. He went outside of the building and began kicking doors and windows. The building, the SEP building was put into a lockdown.

""My understanding of a lockdown is that all doors are closed, all teachers are inside with their students protecting them from the harm that is outside of the building. But there was one particular teacher that stood in the doorway with the door open.

""As Kobe approached the doorway, the teacher was standing there WWE-style. Kobe

said, 'Come on, do you want to f-ing fight?' To which the teacher said, 'Bring it on'. Kobe began to wrestle with the teacher and kicked the teacher in the shins.""

Sarah was called to the school and soon after, Kobe received a 12-month exclusion.

Sarah says even that exclusion indicates the complete lack of understanding of the needs of ASD children.

""It's mind-blowing. Do they think that in 12 months Kobe won't be autistic anymore? That he won't require the same level of support that was never provided to him in the first place?

""Kobe has been destroyed. He had hopes and dreams and aspirations, very large ones, from a very young age of becoming a police officer. He's now left not having even finished his Year 10 education and he is so traumatised.

""I've been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and a panic disorder and my older daughter has also been diagnosed with a Generalised Anxiety Disorder because of the trauma that has been caused for us.

""My son has been made accountable for his actions, which actually directly resulted from a lack of understanding and support from the school, I believe all Education Queensland employees also need to be held accountable for their actions.

""I want an independent investigation into his placement at that school to ascertain the mismanagement that took place and why adequate support was not provided when they were given adequate funding.

""Kobe hates being different. He will say 'I hate my life, I wish I didn't have autism'. He has low self-esteem because he's aware that he can't control his meltdowns. He now refers to himself as a 'bad, bad boy' and will always ask, 'Am I a bad boy, Mum?'

""He is always remorseful after he has had a meltdown and has had the assistance to calm and co or self-regulate. He just wishes that people wouldn't judge him and would understand that his behaviour is as a result of his autism, that he's not just choosing to be naughty.""

Sarah says while it is too late to change the tragic narrative of Kobe's education experience, it's never too late to change the system.

She says schools must be made accountable to follow the guidelines of any student's ISP and to ensure that all funding allocated for their special needs is spent on the students, not other areas of the school such as maintenance or new facilities.

""Our case against the school with QCAT is still proceeding. Proving their discrimination is not about justice for Kobe, but every other child in his position.

""Standing up and speaking at the Royal Commission was well worth it, but it has removed our right to name and shame those involved.

""But I'm hoping that hearing Kobe's story will enable other parents tp speak out as well. These are our children, just because they are different does not mean they are not worthy.

""We owe it to them to listen … and to fix this broken system.""

My parents have been life-long residents of Montgomery County, with my father’s business and family homes located within this county since the 1950s. They have been paying taxes to the county since that time as well, and have educated 6 children in your school systems.

Robert, age 88, and Evelyn, age 85, still live in Montgomery County; they, like many independent seniors, have been largely excluded in the roll-out of the Covid vaccine. The seniors that still live on their own have been almost penalized for not being in an assisted living situation with regards to the vaccine.

Like many senior citizens, they have underlying health conditions, which make them more vulnerable to any type of infection. They have been quarantining, as directed, wear masks when they need to go out and have adhered to all of the guidelines put forth by the CDC.

Weeks ago, I registered them on the Montco website for the vaccine, and here we still sit waiting for the opportunity to make an appointment, despite the guidelines now including the 1B category.

I have many teachers in my family, and we are very happy that they will soon be able to receive the vaccine due to their profession; they have the teacher’s union to advocate for their inclusion. Who is fighting for the independent senior citizens of Montgomery County?

I have spent hours online and on the phone trying to obtain the vaccine for my parents, and I am certain that I am not the only daughter (or son ) that is working diligently, to no avail thus far.

Here’s hoping that someone will start to advocate for the independent senior citizens in the battle against C0VID-19 infection.",Letter to editor: Independent senior citizens need vaccine access,www.timesherald.com
727,728,https://punchng.com/senate-tackles-okupe-over-covid-19-infections-among-elite/,"The Chairman, Senate Committee on Primary Healthcare and Communicable Diseases, Senator Chukwuka Utazi, has described as unscientific, a claim by a former presidential spokesperson, Dr. Doyin Okupe, on the rate of COVID-19 infections among the wealthy elite.

Okupe, a medical practitioner, had in a statement recently said the wealthy elite were contracting the disease more than the poor people because of their lifestyles.

The medical doctor had specifically argued that less cases of COVID-19 infections were being recorded among the masses because they exposed themselves to sunlight and heat daily unlike the wealthy people who hardly expose themselves to sunlight.

Okupe therefore urged members of the upper class to save their lives by avoiding cold enclosed environment because coronavirus thrives in such condition.

However, the Senate panel boss in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja on Friday, disagreed with Okupe, claiming that his submissions were not based on scientific consideration.

Utazi said, “Doyin Okupe is a medical doctor but he didn’t speak as a medical doctor in his write-up. He was speaking like an ordinary Nigerian.

“I will not want to make my comment on his non scientific statement. Whether we have sun or not, Africa is different from Europe and we know that COVID – 19 is a form of pneumonia which has to do with cold.

“When we have winter in Europe and America, more deaths were recorded as a consequence. People should follow all the preventive protocols stipulated by the NCDC, if we do that it will help.

“I don’t believe in self medication. I believe that people should follow what our doctors are telling us”

He said the Senate had canvassed the creation of standard Primary Health Care Centre in each of the electoral wards across the country to ease access to Covid-19 treatment.

He said it would also facilitate the storage of all the vaccines which the Federal Government planned to purchase in order to curb further spread of the COVID – 19 pandemic.

He further explained that the essence of the PHCs in each electoral ward would make the storage, distribution and administration of the vaccines to Nigerians easier because the storage facilities would be closer to the people.

Utazi said the Senate had proposed N1trn for the purpose of constructing the over 10, 000 PHCs across the country.

He also said part of the money would be used to procure more vaccines, recruit manpower and construct additional facilities to store the vaccines.

He explained that the amount would be source from the 2021 and 2022 federal budgets

Utazi said his committee and that of Health, had been engaging the Ministry of Finance, that of Health and all agencies under it, on how to work towards achieving the project.

He said additional PHCs would be created in some bigger electoral wards which could make the proposed facilities be up to 10, 000.

Utazi said, “Some wards are very big, such could have up to five PHCs depending on the population density but for now, it is better to have one in every electoral ward in the country which is not up to 10, 000.

“We would renovate the existing ones in partnership with the government because the development partners are there, ready to work with us.

“Each of the PHC in every electoral ward, will have electricity, generators, solar, accommodation for doctors and nurses, and everything needed to make them functional in that various places they are cited. They would be the first port of call for every patient in the area.

“If they have issues beyond them the PHCs will serve as reference point to secondary and tertiary health centres.

“If we get the vaccines that we are expecting and we don’t have the requisite manpower and infrastructure to manage them in place, it would be a waste of efforts.

“The vaccines are time bound, if you don’t put them where they should be, the potency would disappear. It has to be handled under a regulated condition and weather.

“Additional staff would be recruited, it will not be left for the states and local governments to handle.

“The Primary Healthcare Development Agency will handle the purchase of the vaccines and the distribution

“That is why we are looking for N500bn in the first instance from the 2021 budget. In fact we are looking for N1trn.

“We will get half this year and get the balance next year. The development partners are ready to key into what we are doing.”

Utazi added that the National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control would subject all the vaccines to rigorous laboratory examination before they would be administered on Nigerians.

The Senator said, “The NAFDAC will go to the laboratories to ascertain the efficacy of the drugs and check whether they are good for our system.

“They will also ascertain whether what is written on the pack drugs are the same with the contents.

“NAFDAC will decide the vaccines that we will use in the country. We will reject anyone they reject,” he stated.

728,729,https://www.fox7austin.com/news/larry-king-american-tv-icon-passes-away-at-87,"Larry King, the legendary American talk-show host, has died. He was 87.

Ora Media, the company King cofounded, announced King's passing Saturday morning with a statement on his Twitter account.

""With profound sadness, Ora Media announces the death of our co-founder, host, and friend Larry King, who passed away this morning at age 87 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles,"" the statement said

In Late December 2020, King was hospitalized with a case of COVID-19. After spending some time in the intensive care unit, King improved enough to be moved out of the unit and was breathing on his own.

The television and radio icon spent decades conducting more than 30,000 interviews, including every president from Gerald Ford to Barack Obama. He spent seven years on the nationally syndicated radio program ""The Larry King Show"" and then more than two decades on CNN’s ""Larry King Live.""

RELATED: Larry King reportedly hospitalized in LA with COVID-19

 

During his time on CNN, he earned dozens of awards and was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame and the National Association of Broadcasters Broadcasting Hall of Fame.

 

He retired from ""Larry King Live"" in 2010, but two years later returned to television with the show ""Larry King Now"" and ""Politicking with Larry King,"" which were available on Hulu and RT America.

 

King was born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger on Nov. 19, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York. In 1957, he changed his last name from Zeiger to King as he went on to pursue a career in radio.

 

After graduating high school, he spent several years living at home to help his mother, Jennie Zeiger, after his father, Edward Zeiger, died. Then in his 20s, King moved to Florida to start his career. He worked as a disc jockey in South Florida for some time.

In 1960, King broke into television with a talk show based in Miami. He also wrote for local newspapers in the city, according to CNN. He even became a color commentator for the Miami Dolphins during the 1970 season.

RELATED: Larry King out of ICU after being hospitalized with COVID-19

But in 1971, King was arrested and charged with grand larceny on suspicion of stealing money from a former friend. Those chargers were dropped in 1972 because of the statute of limitations, but it hindered King’s career in broadcast and newspapers for some time.

King briefly left Florida and spent a few years working in public relations before heading back to Miami in 1975. He returned to radio and television and joined the Miami News as a columnist.

 

On Jan. 30, 1978, ""The Larry King Show"" debuted in 28 cities. Within five years, his show reached 118 cities.

 

Seven years later on June 3, 1985, ""Larry King Live"" premiered on CNN. Over the span of 25 years, King interviewed thousands of celebrities, politicians, news leaders and other notable public figures. One of those notable figures was Ross Perot, who announced his bid for the presidency in 1992. King went on to win a Peabody Award for his election coverage that year.

 

In 1987, King suffered a heart attack and underwent a quintuple bypass surgery. A year later, he created the Larry King Cardiac Foundation to help people get medical treatment if they are uninsured or unable to pay hospital bills.

 

King also suffered other health problems, including a stage 1 lung cancer diagnoses in July 2017. He had surgery to remove malignant tissue and did not speak publicly about it until September of that year.

In April 2019, he experienced angina before a scheduled angioplasty. He underwent the procedure, where stents were inserted into his heart to reopen the previous bypass he had in 1987.","Larry King, American TV icon, passes away at 87",www.fox7austin.com

730,731,https://www.communitycommon.com/news/7381/martell-details-problem-facing-scioto-2,"PORTSMOUTH — 5th Ward Councilman Edwin Martell used his ward report during Monday’s City Council meeting to draw attention to an issue facing the community.

That issue, drug addiction, has been reported to be a seriously deadly issue in Scioto County throughout the years, where Harm Reduction Ohio reported 79 overdose deaths in 2020, the worst death rate in the state. Further troubling, HRO used preliminary data from the Ohio Department of Health mortality database, meaning 15% of the deaths have yet to be recorded.

Similarly, an analysis from the Ohio Attorney General’s Scientific Committee on Opioid Prevention and Education found the death rate from opioid overdose reaching new heights in 2020. During a three-month period last year, 35.2 per 100,000 population died from overdoses in the county, again the highest in the state.

Perhaps lost in the mix are the babies born addicted, who through no fault of their own are forced to deal with a problem they might not have the tools the fix.

“It’s very alarming,” said Martell in a Wednesday interview with the PortsmouthDailyTimes. “There are kids out there that are going through things that we can help them with, but they’re still out there. They’re struggling in school, struggling with relationships, struggling with all kinds of things.”

Through the county’s Juvenile Court, Scioto will join Montgomery and Cuyahoga counties in the Safe Babies program, which helps with the diagnosis and providing a helping hand through adulthood.

“They are trying to help them cope with the struggles of addiction,” said Martell of the program. “It’s very important that we try to find ways to slow down the epidemic that’s happening here and I think this is a good program to start slowing that process.”

“If we can catch them early enough, we can help them progressively throughout the years to keep that addiction at bay.”

Seeking both local assistance and federal grants, Safe Babies will help caregivers who Martell says are frequently the grandparents of the addicted children.

“Some grandparents are just not equipped with the capabilities of dealing with a child that has special needs,” he said, services and tools such as transportation and supplies coming through the Safe Babies program.

The program is new to the area and fairly new in general, he said, who is now in the process of training volunteers. Headed by Jordan Davis, Martell was asked to join due to both his a role in local government and his mentorship work through the Juvenile Court.

Martell described the local numbers of babies born addicted as “ungodly awful” to his fellow council members as they were quite near Cuyahoga’s total. Past reporting from the Times found the county led Ohio with 76 babies diagnosed with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome for every 1,000 live births.

The 2016 Children’s Defense Fund study, cited in the article, determined the problem was typical and growing in Appalachian counties, neighboring Lawrence and Pike counties trailing closely with 66.7 per 1,000 and 57.7 per 1,000 live births, respectively.

While Scioto’s population is approximately 6% of Cuyahoga’s, a three-month study revealed that only six more babies were born addicted in the Cleveland-area county.

Martell said those numbers- 137 in Cuyahoga and 131 in Scioto- do not paint the full picture as many cases remain open. Of the three involved counties, Scioto has the least with 175 open cases, Montgomery with 776 and Cuyahoga with 2,700.

Safe Babies may not be able to cure the opioid epidemic, says Martell, but could at least help curb some of its effects and mitigate the issue.

Either or he says it will take a team effort.

“If we have enough people, one someone is going to know someone who can help,” he said. “That old saying, “it takes a village to raise a child,” if we really want to do something about this epidemic, it’s going to take a community.”

The program plans on meeting at least once a month and is looking for volunteers from active community members. Martell said during the Monday council session that he can be contacted if residents had any more questions.

• A Michigan woman asked a city official to condemn the Proud Boys during a live stream meeting and he showed off his rifle instead.
• Keli MacIntosh asked officials from the Michigan Grand Traverse County Board of Commissioners if they would denounce the group that has seen multiple arrests after the January 6 Capitol attacks that killed five people.

A Michigan woman asked a city official to condemn the Proud Boys during a live stream meeting. Instead, he flashed his rifle.

During the Michigan Grand Traverse County Board of Commissioners' live-streamed public meeting last week, Ron Clous, the commission's vice-chair, can be seen rising from his seat, stepping out of the frame, and returning with a semiautomatic rifle in his hands after Keli MacIntosh asked officials if they would denounce the Proud Boys during Wednesday's Zoom call.

Now, people are calling on Clous to resign, according to USA Today.

In a letter from Traverse City-based attorney Michael Naughton, he claims Clous violated a Michigan law that ""a person cannot willingly show a firearm in public,"" The Ticker reported.

She referred to the county's status as a ""Second Amendment sanctuary,"" threats against Governor Gretchen Whitmer who was the center of a kidnapping plot last fall, and the Proud Boys' armed presence at the state capitol. Members of the Proud Boys have been charged in the January 6 Capitol attacks that killed five people.

""It's really hard to tell the difference between the Proud Boys and the message they want through our state, how that's different from what's happened in Washington,"" MacIntosh said, adding that welcoming the Proud Boys and their message has ""changed the environment in Northern Michigan from a hunting culture to that of a gun culture.""

MacIntosh told The Washington Post she was terrified after the incident.

""He is supposed to be looking out for the best interests of the community,"" she told The Post. ""What is the message he's trying to convey? That if someone speaks out against us, we'll just threaten them with a gun?""

Clous spoke to the Traverse City Record-Eagle and defended his actions.

""I was just going to show the rifle and show that I fully support the Second Amendment, but then I opted not to ... I was in my home,"" he said.

He told the newspaper he won't denounce any group, including Black Lives Matter, the NFL, or LBGTQ.

""The only thing I know about them (Proud Boys) is when they came and spoke to us,"" Clous said. ""They were probably the most respected folks that got up and talked. They were decent guys and they treated us with respect.

The Southern Poverty Law Center considered the Proud Boys as a hate group.

Intosh claimed the commissioner invited the Proud Boys to speak for 20 minutes at a March meeting, but the commission's Chairman Rob Hentschel denied the claim.

""I'm not a member of Proud Boys and I did not give a Proud Boy 20 minutes of time,"" Hentschel, who appeared amused when Clous showed up his firearm, said in Wednesday's meeting.

""I've met Black, multiracial, and Puerto Rican Proud Boys — they've informed me they have gay Proud Boys,"" he added. ""I don't see how that's a hate group.""",A Michigan official who was asked to publicly condemn the Proud Boys was asked to resign,www.insider.com

733,734,https://www.fox7austin.com/news/lawmaker-hopes-bigfoot-hunting-season-draws-tourists,"A state lawmaker in Oklahoma is targeting Bigfoot — the mythical, ape-like creature that has captured the imagination of adventurers for decades.

Rep. Justin Humphrey, a Republican member of the House, has introduced a bill that would create a Bigfoot hunting season. His district includes southeast Oklahoma's heavily forested Ouachita Mountains, which hosts a Bigfoot festival every year.

""A lot of people don’t believe in Bigfoot, but a lot of people do,"" Humphrey said. ""Just like some people like to go deer hunting, while some don't.""

In a press release, Humphrey acknowledges that he has worked on ""more serious matters, such as censorship, protecting the beef industry,"" but that tourism is also important to his district. So having a season to hunt Bigfoot ""will just draw more people to our already beautiful part of the state,"" he said.

But the cowboy-hat-and-bolo-tie-wearing lawmaker doesn't want anyone to kill Bigfoot so his legislation would establish rules for trapping the creature instead. He also wants to secure a $25,000 bounty for the first adventurer who manages to trap the elusive bipedal beast.

The thing is, the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, which oversees hunting in the state, doesn't recognize Bigfoot as an actual real thing that can be hunted. Spokesman Micah Holmes told television station KOCO that the agency uses science-driven research in setting its hunting slate.

That doesn't seem to be deterring Humphrey, though.

""Again, the overall goal is to get people to our area to enjoy the natural beauty and to have a great time,"" he said, ""and if they find Bigfoot while they’re at it, well hey, that’s just an even bigger prize.""

734,735,https://www.voanews.com/usa/immigration/democrats-start-reining-expectations-immigration-bill,"WASHINGTON - It's taken only days for Democrats gauging how far President Joe Biden's bold immigration proposal can go in Congress to acknowledge that if anything emerges, it will likely be significantly more modest.

As they brace to tackle a politically flammable issue that's resisted major congressional action since the 1980s, Democrats are using words like ""aspirational"" to describe Biden's plan and ""herculean"" to express the effort they'll need to prevail.

A cautious note came from the White House on Friday when press secretary Jen Psaki said the new administration views Biden's plan as a ""first step"" it hopes will be ""the basis"" of discussions in Congress. Democrats' measured tones underscore the fragile road they face on a paramount issue for their minority voters, progressives and activists.

Immigration proponents advocating an all-out fight say Democrats' new hold on the White House and Congress provides a major edge, but they concede they may have to accept less than total victory. Paving a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, the centerpiece of Biden's plan, is ""the stake at the summit of the mountain,"" Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigration group America's Voice, said in an interview. He said proponents might have to accept ""stepping stones"" along the way.

The citizenship process in Biden's plan would take as little as three years for some people, eight years for others. It would make it easier for certain workers to stay in the U.S. temporarily or permanently, provide development aid to Central American nations in hopes of reducing immigration and move toward bolstering border screening technology.

No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Richard Durbin of Illinois said in an interview this week that the likeliest package to emerge would start with creating a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers. They are an estimated 1 million immigrants who've lived in the U.S. most of their lives after being brought here illegally as children.

More than 600,000 of them have temporary permission to live in the U.S. under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Former President Barack Obama created that program administratively, and Durbin and others want to protect it by enacting it into law.

Durbin, who called Biden's plan ""aspirational,"" said he'd push for as many other elements as possible, including more visas for agricultural workers and others.

""We understand the political reality of a 50-50 Senate, that any changes in immigration will require cooperation between the parties,"" said Durbin, who is on track to become Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. He said Senate legislation likely ""will not reach the same levels"" as Biden's proposal.

The Senate is split evenly between the two parties, with Vice President Kamala Harris tipping the chamber to Democrats with her tiebreaking vote. Even so, passing major legislation requires 60 votes to overcome filibusters, or endless procedural delays. That means 10 Republicans must join all 50 Democrats to enact an immigration measure, a tall order.

""Passing immigration reform through the Senate, particularly, is a herculean task,"" said Senator Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who will also play a lead role in the battle. He said Democrats ""will get it done"" but the effort will require negotiation.

Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who's worked with Democrats on past immigration efforts, said ""comprehensive immigration is going to be a tough sale"" this year.

""I think the space in a 50-50 Senate will be some kind of DACA deal,"" he said.

Illustrating the bargaining ahead, Senator Susan Collins, R-Maine, a moderate who's sought earlier immigration compromises, praised parts of Biden's plan but said she wanted changes, including more visas for the foreign workers her state's tourism industry uses heavily.

Democrats' hurdles are formidable. They have razor-thin majorities in a House and Senate where Republican support for easing immigration restrictions is usually scant. Acrid partisan relationships were intensified by former President Donald Trump's clamorous tenure. Biden will have to spend plenty of political capital and time on earlier, higher-priority bills battling the pandemic and bolstering the economy, leaving his future clout uncertain.

Democrats also must resolve tactical differences. Sharry said immigration groups prefer that Democrats push for the strongest possible bill without concessions to Republicans' demands, like boosting border security spending. He said hopes for a bipartisan breakthrough are ""a fool's errand"" because the GOP has largely opposed immigration overhauls for so long.

But prevailing without GOP votes would mean virtual unanimity among congressional Democrats, a huge challenge. It would also mean Democrats would have to eliminate the Senate filibuster, which they may not have the votes to do, or concoct other procedural routes around the 60-vote hurdle.

""I'm going to start negotiating"" with Republicans, Durbin said. He added that a bipartisan bill would be better ""if we can do it"" because it would improve chances for passage.

Democrats already face attacks from Republicans, eyeing next year's elections, on an issue that helped power Trump's 2016 victory by fortifying his support from many white voters.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Biden's proposal would ""prioritize help for illegal immigrants and not our fellow citizens."" Senator Rick Scott, R-Fla., who heads the Senate Republican campaign committee, said the measure would hurt ""hardworking Americans and the millions of immigrants working their way through the legal immigration process.""

Democrats say such allegations are false but say it's difficult to compose crisp, sound-bite responses on the complex issue. It requires having ""an adult conversation"" with voters, Representative Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., said in an interview.

""Yeah, this is about people, but it's about the economy,"" too, said Spanberger, a moderate from a district where farms and technology firms hire many immigrants. ""In central Virginia, we rely on immigration. And you may not like that, but we do.""",Democrats Start Reining in Expectations for Immigration Bill,www.voanews.com

737,738,https://www.npr.org/transcripts/959602229,"David Gilkey was blunt-headed, bull-shouldered, good-humored, loyal, brave, meticulous, sometimes a little manic and deeply sensitive to the world, his friends, his work. He covered hurricanes, floods, famines, tsunamis and wars by bringing his feet - which he called the greatest zoom lens ever invented - close into the lives of people.

David Gilkey was NPR's staff photographer. He enjoyed all the jokes about taking pictures for a radio network. I photographed the little things I had stopped seeing, he once wrote. The Taliban ambushed and killed David and his friend and interpreter, Zabihullah Tamanna, in June 2016. Friends, including NPR's Quil Lawrence, Tom Bowman, David Greene and Julie McCarthy have shared memories in a book of David's photographs, ""Pictures On The Radio."" And we are honored to be joined by Alyda Gilkey, David's mother, from Portland, Ore.

Thanks so much for being with us, Alyda.

SIMON: Please tell us about him growing up, the little boy in the basement.

GILKEY: He was a bit of a handful when he was growing up (laughter). My husband, Dick, was a school administrator, but he really loved photography. And so when we built our house, he put a darkroom in the basement. And we discovered later that when we would send David downstairs to play with all the toys in that part of the basement, he would often go in and look at his dad's photographs, which were standing up in a big cabinet. Dick showed both kids how to use the darkroom, and David really took to it. He just thought that was wonderful.

SIMON: You note in the book he had some wild times as a teen. Anything you can tell us about?

GILKEY: No, I don't think so (laughter).

SIMON: Oh, that wild? Yeah. Was his camera a kind of passport to the world, do you think?

GILKEY: Oh, definitely, yes. He loved to travel, loved to go and see places.

GILKEY: So the camera was just perfect for him. And when he got his first job with a newspaper in Boulder, Colo., then the company that owned that, Knight Ridder, sent him to South Africa. And that was just - he just thought that was wonderful. Then when he went to NPR, that was just perfect because he could travel the world from there.

SIMON: Alyda, I got to ask, did you worry about him?

GILKEY: Oh, of course, always. When he was growing up, he was always doing things fast anyway. I mean, he skied fast. He skated fast. He was on the roller speedskating team, which was just the perfect thing for him.

SIMON: Yeah. The photos in this book are utterly stunning. And just to note a few, there's - in fact, I think the cover photograph is Marine Lance Cpl. Espinoza in Helmand province, wiping the sweat from his eyes with his gloved finger, and Crystal Turner, a Marine vet, hugging her year-and-a-half-old daughter to her knees; and then a Palestinian man on the West Bank holding his dead pet bird after an attack. These are details of lives that often go unnoticed. Do you think that's what David was looking for?

GILKEY: I think so, yes. All of his pictures seem to have a story. And I have some hanging in my apartment. And I know that people will come into my apartment, they'll look at them, and they'll want to know more about what that is a picture of. What's the story behind that? And I think that was a part of the magic of his photographs.

SIMON: Did he talk to you about people he photographed when he'd come home?

GILKEY: No, didn't talk much about the places he had been. He would answer my questions, but I had to come up with the right question.

SIMON: This is personal, but I have to ask, did you ever urge him to stop as he approached his 50s? You know, say, come on, David, settle down in Happy Valley?

GILKEY: I talked to him about it once. And I said, what kind of photography do you really want to do? And he said, well, I want to do the kind where I have to go out into the world and find out what's happening. And I said, well, I guess you're never going to be a wedding photographer.

GILKEY: And he said, no way. No way.

GILKEY: It was just what he wanted to do.

SIMON: Why do you think people opened up their lives to him, as so many did?

GILKEY: Well, there was just something about him that was - I don't really know how to describe it. There was something about his personality that just seemed to put people at ease, and so they would just talk to him.

SIMON: What do you hope people will know about your son as they go through this book?

GILKEY: I hope that they'll realize that he was very sensitive, and that kind of got him in a little trouble when he was growing up because people didn't realize how sensitive he was, but he was a good son.

SIMON: Alyda Gilkey - the book of photographs by her son and our friend David Gilkey is ""Pictures On The Radio.""

738,739,https://www.ktvq.com/rebound/montana-veterans-meat-locker-sees-success-with-carbon-county-distribution-effort,"BRIDGER — Volunteers with the Billings nonprofit, Montana Veteran's Meat Locker, took a 106-mile tour through four Carbon County towns Saturday, giving free domestic and game meat to veterans and their families.

Q2 caught up with the volunteers at their first stop in Bridger at 9:30 a.m. Jerad Werning, a board member for the Montana Veteran's Meat Locker, spear headed the organization of the nonprofit's first distribution effort of the year. He grew up in Edgar, just 13 miles north of Bridger.

""I figured it would be a good place. We get a lot of donations from Carbon County of wild game and beef, so why not give back to the community? We just planned to do a loop to hit all of Carbon County as much as we could,"" Werning said.

The group of volunteers stopped in Bridger, Red Lodge, Joliet and Rockvale over the course of the morning.

“It was really busy right at first, then it slowed down a bit. You know, these small communities. Hopefully we get a few more. I’ll bet we’ve had 20 people so far,"" Werning said about midway through the Bridger stop.

Werning served in the National Guard for 12 years and was deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005. He's been out of the national guard for eight years and has spent the last four years with the vet's meat locker.

Werning said his service to the nonprofit gives him purpose.

“It’s great. It’s a good way to give back. It helps me out mentally. It kind of gives me a purpose again to help serve the state and fellow veterans and the communities around here,"" Werning said.

Werning is even able to do the volunteer work with some old friends

“It’s great camaraderie. Actually, a few of the guys that are helping here, I was actually in the service with and I haven’t seen for probably 15 years. It’s a pretty good deal,"" Werning said.

The Montana Veteran's Meat Locker has been donating meat to veterans for five years. In that time, volunteers have distributed more than 77,000 pounds of meat to around 5,700 veterans.

The nonprofit was started by Chris Grudzinski and his wife Kristin, with the two originally storing meat in their garage freezer. Now the group has a freezer trailer that can reach more vets across the state.

Hunters and ranchers donate their harvests and the vet's meat locker pays for processing and distributes the processed meat for free.

""The ranchers, farmers, they’ve been great and all of the hunters around here have been great. It’s Montana giving back to Montanans,"" Werning said.

The Montana Veteran's Meat Locker is a good example of how Montana communities often help each other out, Werning said.

“A lot of this is happening in Yellowstone County and Billings, that’s just because that’s where we’re based, but we’re trying to push it out because you know Montana, we’re all just one big community really. It’s just a great organization that I’m grateful to be a part of,"" Werning said.

Grudzinski said the nonprofit set a lofty goal this year of distributing meat in every single town in Montana. With 235 census-designated places in Montana, the freezer trailer will put on a lot of miles this year. Werning said the nonprofit is always looking for donations, either monetary or in the form of meat.

If people put up the money to process their own meat, they can be entered into regular raffle drawings the nonprofit hosts, Werning said.

""We’ve got ranchers that are donating beef and bison. The more donations that we can get, either monetary or animal-wise is great and we’re always looking for processors that are available. They are super busy this time of year, especially this year with COVID-19. Trying to find processors that can get us in and work with us and help us out would be a great deal,"" Werning said.

739,740,https://punchng.com/restructure-let-fulani-go-their-way-miyetti-allah-tells-fg/,"The Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore herdsmen group has called on the Federal Government to heed the call for the restructuring of the country to allow the Fulani go their way.

The National Secretary of the group, Saleh Alhassan, said in an interview with our correspondent on Saturday that herdsmen were being marginalised in the country and that it was best if they were on their own where they would be protected.

There have been calls for the restructuring of the country, with many southern groups insisting that it was the only way the country could move forward, while northern groups have largely been divided on the issue.

Resource control, fairness and the allegations of killings, invasion of farmlands and people’s properties, kidnapping and other criminal activities against some herdsmen had fuelled the calls for restructuring of the country. The herders/farmers clashes had also increased the distrust among the ethnic groups, with some individuals from the different zones issuing quit notice to some others.

Alhassan however told Sunday PUNCH that it was wrong to punish a group of people for the sins of some.

He said, “We don’t support crime. So, I’m not saying there are no Fulani that are criminals, there are, like other tribes, but don’t destroy their profession. It’s not good for the country. If everything busts, it’s to the advantage of the herders because we are not even enjoying the federation.

“We are even bidding for restructuring of the country; let every part go, so we can say this is where we are. As it is now, there is no form of marginalisation we are not seeing in this country. Everywhere we are being marginalised. You think we will accept Nigeria where we don’t have access to land to feed our animals and you think there will be peace?”

When asked if he thinks restructuring would solve the herders/farmers crisis, he said, “Quite fundamentally. If we leave today now and if there is no oil revenue, won’t they pay attention to animal rearing? If we restructure the country and the South-West region says they won’t accept cattle unless they are brought to the market or supermarket, it’s okay by us.

“The mistake people make is that they think when they put pressure on herders they are getting at President (Muhammadu) Buhari. Buhari has no relationship with the herders. That is the truth. When people say he is our grandpatron, was Jonathan from the South-South not our grandpatron?

“If the President is a Fulani, it doesn’t in any way affect the life of a herder. In fact, they are worse off under Buhari. What are they benefitting? They don’t access any government facility or social amenity, yet they are responsible for the bulk of animal protein we produce in this country. I think it’s deliberate for people to think otherwise.

“Buhari has not done anything for us other than creating enemies for us. Herders are being chased around. Let us look at the larger picture and not allow enemies penetrate us. If Buhari loves the herders, he would have created the grazing reserves for them.”

…says govt must address issues around land use

He said further that government’s refusal to address the issue of land management, which he said is at the root of the crisis, had been fuelling the crisis.

In Ondo State, the governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, on Monday gave a seven-day ultimatum to herdsmen to vacate all forest reserves in the state, saying kidnapping and other nefarious activities had been traced to the activities of some bad elements masquerading as herdsmen.

“These felons have turned our forest reserves into hideouts for keeping victims of kidnapping, negotiating for ransom and carrying out other criminal activities,” he added. But the Presidency and some northern groups faulted the directive. The herdsmen have also said they would not vacate the forest.

There was also increased tension in Igangan, Ibarapa North Local Government Area of Oyo State on Friday when a Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Igboho, reportedly stormed the Fulani settlement in the town to eject the Seriki Fulani, Salihu Abdukadir, and some other herdsmen accused of fuelling security problems in the area, having issued a ‘quit notice’ to them earlier.

Alhassan added, “Government needs to be careful, and the real issue at stake is basically that of land resource management. These herders don’t have land and they do their business on land resource and we have a lot of land in this country. What we are saying is that the government should create an alternative for them.

“We need to modernise cattle grazing and the government needs to have an input because land belongs to the government. You can’t do ranching without land. Modernising it is a key solution to this and the government has a key role to play.

“We must accommodate the herders in Nigeria, whichever arrangement, because that is the sustainable way to peace. Create a sustainable land use policy where you accommodate people that have a need for the land. Create grazing land for these people and create laws that would govern them. If we don’t solve this problem, we will be complicating it.”

Alhassan however warned that further attacks on the herdsmen might be pushing them into rebellion. “Our fear is for these people not to be radicalised, and people who accuse herders of committing crimes should get the security agents to arrest and prosecute them,” he added.

From the frontline workers safeguarding our health, safety and education, and countless acts of kindness, the campaign – partnering News Corp Australia, Woolworths and Australia Post and supported by the National Australia Day Council – has enabled us to share heartwarming and inspiring stories.

Today’s liftout runs in our papers nationally, highlighting frontline heroes most deserving our thanks.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared January 26 a national day of thanks, calling on citizens to keep making their gratitude known.

Mr Morrison said the pandemic had forced us to realise the role played by every member of our community.

“COVID-19 has underlined the importance of those jobs we rely on every day – and deepened our gratitude for the incredibly committed Australians who do them,” he said.

“It has been a testing year for Australia, and it will take time to recover and emerge.

“However, I am confident we will – because I have seen our strength. I have also seen how we care for each other.

“And I know that Australians who have lost family, jobs or businesses will draw strength from the love, affection and support of their family, friends, neighbours and community.”

Harley Fuller is just one inspiring frontline hero brought to light by Thanks A Million.

The assistant store manager at Woolworths in Lake Cathie fought on two fronts over the past 12 months.

Defending homes in Black Summer as an RFS volunteer, Mr Fuller risked his life and was then called to help countless anxious customers in the aisles of his busy regional store.

“In all the negatives, out of fires, out of COVID, even out of the floods straight after the fires … the community has all come together, been through similar situations and we’ve all gotten stronger from it,” Mr Fuller said.

“What we do every day, whether it’s our job or whether it is the community support, it’s a choice. Helping people is a bonus out of the whole situation. For me, it’s just part of the choice we’ve made.”

Michael Miller, executive chairman of News Corp Australasia, said it was because of people like Mr Fuller and countless others that the country has done so well in dealing with this deadly pandemic.

“While there will undoubtedly be economic impacts that are felt for some time yet, we have, to date, escaped the worst of the health impacts when compared to the rest of the world,” he said.

“To the police forces, emergency workers, doctors, nurses and carers. To the supermarket workers, delivery drivers and essential service providers. On behalf of all of our readers and all of our colleagues across Australia we would like to say thank you.”

NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Rob Rogers said it had been inspiring to witness the outpouring of community spirit and willingness to help out during these trying times.

“As we reflect on the past year, we recognise it will be a difficult time for many,” Comm Rogers said. “So many experienced immense loss last season – including the families of our people who made the ultimate sacrifice, and the members of the community who lost loved ones, and those who lost their home.

“We have welcomed more than 8000 new volunteers into our service this past year, largely as a result of people wanting to help after last season. It is also worth recognising the remarkable level of support from the community, with more than $100 million of public donations being received.”

The year 2020 began as International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife and became one where these people were more valued than ever.

“Every nurse and midwife in NSW has contributed selflessly to tackle COVID-19 since it reached our shores,” NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association acting general secretary Judith Kiejda said.

“This Thank You Day, we recognise the (huge) sacrifices of nurses and midwives.”

Queensland Nurses and Midwives’ Union secretary Beth Mohle said nurses, midwives, aged care and health workers continued putting others’ wellbeing ahead of their own.

Ms Mohle said the QNMU and Queenslanders were extremely proud of this special workforce. She said their effort was the foundation of both a safe community and strong economy.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has again highlighted the expertise, strength and bravery of Queensland’s nurses, midwives, aged care staff and health workers,’’ Ms Mohle said.

“The QNMU applauds all Queenslanders who have stayed home, been tested and offered acts of kindness and words of support.”

Qld Teachers’ Union President Cresta Richardson said schools in the state remained open to support families of workers in critical industries and acknowledged parents who helped manage remote learning.

“Our teachers and school leaders as frontline workers have reinvented the way they work …(from) a new assessment and tertiary entrance system (to) children and adults adjusting to remote learning as required by the new COVID normal,” Ms Richardson said.

The Australian Education Union Victorian branch president Meredith Peace said teachers, principals and support staff ensured went above and beyond despite grave challenges.

“The fact that they still managed to deliver a high-quality education to students all over Victoria during the pandemic shows how professional, dedicated and resilient they are,” Ms Peace said.

“All Victorians have a new level of respect and understanding of the value of teachers, principals and support staff in their role of educating our kids and we want to give a heartfelt thank you to all of you.”

Country Fire Authority chief officer Jason Heffernan said 2020 was exceptionally difficult year for all Victorians.

“CFA members faced one of the most challenging fire seasons in many years,” Mr Heffernan said.

“Our members went above and beyond in their mission to save lives and properties, particularly in East Gippsland and North East Victoria.

“From battling historic campaign fires, to dealing with the lingering effects of the drought on communities across the state; 2020 highlighted the dedication of our volunteers to Victoria and I would like to personally thank all our members who contributed to the challenges we faced.”

The South Australian Ambulance Service saw a sharp increase in demand for its services, as bushfires raged and the pandemic began.

“As a result of its dedicated and professional workforce, coupled with our emergency preparedness and management, SAAS met the demands of 2020,” COVID Incident Commander Chris Howie ASM said.

“Some of our people continued to save their communities even though they had been directly affected personally.

“The leadership team at SAAS is so proud of the way our people represented themselves and our service in 2020 and we thank them for their dedication to each other, our community and the state of South Australia.”

Schools in the state experienced immense pressure last year but have been fearless in coping with many new demands.

“Teachers, leaders and support staff have worked incredibly hard over the past year in challenging circumstances,” said Lara Golding, president of the SA branch of the Australian Education Union.

“They have gone above and beyond, supporting families in crisis and adapting teaching.”

Protecting our shores from the COVID-19 pandemic remains paramount to maintaining where we are today.

National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre executive director Professor Len Notaras said its Australian Medical Assistance Teams staff had been supporting the country’s COVID-19 response for a year.

“Our efforts commenced with supporting repatriated Australians from Wuhan on Christmas Island and progressed to assisting Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia and, since October 2020, the Australian Government in operating the AUSMAT-led Centre for National Resilience at Howard Springs in the Northern Territory,” he said.

“The staff who have worked to support the CNR have done so with compassion, resilience, professionalism, selflessness and good humour for long hours, in the challenging wet season, heat and conditions that are extreme, (including) full PPE in the humidity and rain,” he said.

St John Ambulance NT director of ambulance services Andrew Thomas said frontline workers continued to provide high-level care under ever-changing circumstances while maintaining COVID-safe practices.

“In a year that stretched people to their limits, St John NT employees and volunteers demonstrated incredible resilience and flexibility,” Mr Thomas said.

“We want to thank our ambulance service staff and the entire St John NT team for their tireless work and dedication throughout 2020. Say thanks to an ambo next time you see one.”

Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said he was proud of the response of the Tasmanian community during the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The thing that has made me most happy during the course of the year … has been the common humanity that I’ve witnessed right across our community, where Tasmanians, regardless of race, background, religion, they have held out their hand to other Tasmanians and they’ve helped each other,” Mr Gutwein said.

“I think that they recognised the seriousness of the challenges as a starting point and they’ve worked together to get on top of it.”

Emily Shepherd, secretary of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation Tasmania, said frontline health workers had gone above and beyond to help protect their communities.

“Nurses, midwives and care workers have been on the frontline of the COVID-19 response and leading the treatment of those affected as well as helping to contain and prevent further outbreaks,” Ms Shepherd said.

“The changes to their practice have been enormous and at times incredibly fatiguing. However, their professionalism, skills and knowledge have supported their patients, clients and residents through this incredibly challenging time as well as the broader community.”

742,743,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/435081/cape-farewell-ecosanctuary-progressing-despite-setbacks,"A global pandemic and the virtual destruction of a rare bird colony has not deterred a group creating an ecosanctuary on the northernmost tip of the South Island.

The Wharariki Ecosanctuary at Cape Farewell was opened in January 2020.

It was hoped to have new new seabirds roosting at the sanctuary by now, but Covid-19 set back plans for the re-introduction last year of a variety of seabirds that were once there in abundance.

The sanctuary was formed through a partnership between HealthPost Nature Trust, Manawhenua ki Mōhua and the Department of Conservation.

Trust chair Peter Butler said despite the setbacks, including the discovery of an almost-destroyed colony of fluttering shearwater, they had achieved a number of conservation goals.

He said they made a grim discovery in October that a previously considered healthy population of fluttering shearwater on a nearby small island had been almost wiped out by what appeared to be a rodent predator.

The Trust hired a helicopter to land three seabird experts on to rock stack south of the sanctuary, called Nguroa Island.

The aim was to assess whether it could be a source of fluttering shearwater and diving petrel chicks for reintroduction to the mainland via the ecosanctuary.

""A survey in 1997 had established that there was a colony of about 5000 pair of these seabirds on this island. Our October expedition found we only about a dozen pair left.""

Butler said it appeared that predators had crossed to the island in an extreme tide and caused a massacre.

""It was a real blow for all of us, but it really brought home how critical the protection work we're doing is.""

They now planned to intensively trap the shoreline adjacent Nguroa Island to give the remnant population a chance to rebuild.

A plan was also under way to re-introduce the threatened flesh-footed shearwater to the ecosanctuary by late autumn.

""We've got our eyes set on something with the 'slightly creepy' name of flesh-footed shearwater, which are threatened, so we're investigating the possibility of re-introducing them in the late autumn.""

Butler said despite everything, the trust had managed a list of achievements this year include conversion of a former DOC house at Farewell Spit into a field station and the appointment of a field co-ordinator who has organised groups of volunteers to plant trees and service trap networks.

""We had two hundred large double traps made up at the Menzshed-Nelson/Whakatu over the winter that we have deployed in new trap lines.

""We now protect from the southern end of Wharariki beach on the West Coast all the way to Puponga in Golden Bay , in several lines, creating a 'virtual fence' across this narrow corner of the South Island,"" Butler said.

He said the traps, designed to catch rats, stoats, the ""odd weasel"" and wild cats, but prevent curious weka from poking about were not able to be checked during Covid lockdown.

""We've got two or three lines of traps running from the Tasman Sea to Golden Bay which should protect Farewell Spit.""

He said they were surprised at the ""enormous number"" of stoats they were catching - sometimes up to 23 in a trapline with the capacity to catch up to 80 pests. Butler said despite this, it was encouraging that the numbers were not increasing relative to the number of traps.

""That's an indication that trapping is successful and we are getting the predator numbers down.""

This year the Trust had also found a second remnant population of Sooty Shearwaters nesting onshore, and ring trapped the area and eliminated a resident wild pig to enhance their chances of survival.

""Our cameras tell us little blue penguins have occupied some of the empty Sooty burrows,"" Butler said.

About 3000 trees - mainly cabbage tree, kaikomako and kanuka - have been planted in the ecosanctuary and around Wharariki wetland to enhance habitat and provide bird food.

Butler said they were putting the finishing touches on the new field station house in early December when the first scientist, gecko expert Sam King, turned up for a week of research into the rare Nelson Green Gecko.

Butler said two Victoria University masters students studying the paper wasp problem on the Spit were now in residence for the summer, supported by a stipend from the Trust.",Cape Farewell ecosanctuary progressing despite setbacks,www.rnz.co.nz

745,746,https://www.fox7austin.com/news/biden-signs-executive-orders-on-15-minimum-wage-for-federal-workers-food-aid-increases,"President Joe Biden took executive action Friday to provide a stopgap measure of financial relief to millions of Americans while Congress begins to consider his much larger $1.9 trillion package to help those affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

The two executive orders that Biden signed would increase food aid, protect job seekers on unemployment and clear a path for federal workers and contractors to get a $15 hourly minimum wage.

""The American people cannot afford to wait,"" said Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council. ""So many are hanging by a thread. They need help, and we're committed to doing everything we can to provide that help as quickly as possible.""

Deese emphasized that the orders are not substitutes for the additional stimulus that Biden says is needed beyond the $4 trillion in aid that has already been approved, including $900 billion this past December. Several Republican lawmakers have voiced opposition to provisions in Biden's plan for direct payments to individuals, state and local government aid and a $15 hourly minimum wage nationwide.

RELATED: Biden signs 10 executive orders on pandemic, warns things will ‘get worse before they get better’

Most economists believe the United States can rebound with strength once people are vaccinated from the coronavirus, but the situation is still dire as the disease has closed businesses and schools. Nearly 10 million jobs have been lost since last February, and nearly 30 million households lack secure access to food.

One of Biden's orders asks the Agriculture Department to consider adjusting the rules for food assistance, so that the government could be obligated to provide more money to the hungry.

Children who are unable to get school meals because of remote learning could receive a 15% increase in food aid, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. The lowest-income households could qualify for the emergency benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. And the formula for calculating meal costs could become more generous.

The order also tries to make it easier for people to claim direct payments from prior aid packages and other benefits. In addition, it would create a guarantee that workers could still collect unemployment benefits if they refuse to take a job that could jeopardize their health.

Biden's second executive order would restore union bargaining rights revoked by the Trump administration, protect the civil service system and promote a $15 hourly minimum wage for all federal workers. The Democratic president also plans to start a 100-day process for the federal government to require its contractors to pay at least $15 an hour and provide emergency paid leave to workers, which could put pressure on other private employers to boost their wages and benefits.

These orders arrive as the Biden White House has declined to provide a timeline for getting its proposed relief package through, saying that officials are beginning to schedule meetings with lawmakers to discuss the proposal.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a Thursday briefing that the proposal has support ranging from democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

RELATED: Biden signs executive orders on COVID-19, immigration, rejoining Paris climate accord and WHO

But not all components of the package are popular among Republicans, and that could delay passage in ways that could injure the economy. Psaki stressed that Biden wants any deal to be bipartisan and that the process of meeting with lawmakers to talk through the plan is just beginning.

Biden must balance the need for immediate aid against the risk of prolonged negotiations. Psaki told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Friday that Biden is ""not going to take tools off the table"" as he looks to bring Republicans to the table, and she argued that the back-and-forth is ""exactly how it should work.""

""We’ll figure out what the sausage looks like when it comes out of the machine,"" she said.

Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the Chamber, told reporters Thursday that Congress should act fast to approve the roughly $400 billion for national vaccination and reopening schools and other elements of the plan with bipartisan support, rather than drag out negotiations.

""We’re not going to let areas of disagreement prevent progress on areas where we can find common ground,"" Bradley said. ""We cannot afford six months to get the vaccination process working right. ... We can’t even wait six weeks to get vaccinations distributed and schools reopened.""","Biden signs executive orders on $15 minimum wage for federal workers, food aid increases",www.fox7austin.com
746,747,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/focus/2021/01/24/beginning-of-the-end-of-nuclear-weapons,"ON Friday, many around the world celebrated the first multilateral nuclear disarmament treaty to enter into force in 50 years.

The United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) was adopted at the United Nations in 2017 and finally reached the milestone of 50 ratifications in October 2020 (and gained legal force on Jan 22, after a 90-day period). The countries that have signed and ratified include Austria, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Nigeria and Thailand. Malaysia ratified the treaty on Sept 30 last year.

The treaty completes the suite of international bans on all major weapons considered unacceptable because of their indiscriminate and inhumane effects, including anti-personnel landmines, cluster munitions, biological and chemical weapons.

The countries that have signed the TPNW were fed up with over half a century of the nuclear-armed states flouting their obligation to rid the world of their weapons. They have asserted the interests of humanity and global democracy in a way the nuclear-armed states were powerless to stop.

It is certainly long overdue for the most cruel and destructive weapons of all – nuclear weapons – to be banned. But this treaty is a sign of hope, a necessary and important step toward a less destructive planet.

The aim of the treaty is a comprehensive and categorical ban of nuclear weapons. It binds signatories not to develop, test, produce, acquire, have control of, use or threaten to use nuclear weapons. States also cannot “assist, encourage or induce” anyone to engage in any activity prohibited under the treaty – essentially anything to do with nuclear weapons.

The TPNW strengthens the current nuclear safeguards found in the 1970 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons by requiring all states that join to have comprehensive provisions in place and not allowing states to weaken their existing safeguards.

The treaty provides the first legally binding multilateral framework for a process by which all nations can work toward eliminating nuclear weapons. For instance, states with another nation’s nuclear weapons stationed on their territory must remove them.

States with nuclear weapons can “destroy then join” the treaty, or “join then destroy”. They must irreversibly dismantle their weapons, as well as the programs and facilities to produce them, subject to agreed timelines and verification by an international authority.

Further, the TPNW is the first treaty to commit member nations to provide long-neglected assistance for the victims of atomic bombs and weapon testing. It also calls for nations to clean up environments contaminated by nuclear weapons use and testing, where feasible.

Currently, 86 nations have signed the TPNW, and 51 have ratified it (meaning they are bound by its provisions). The treaty now becomes part of international law, and the number of signatories and ratifications will continue to grow.

However, none of the nine nuclear powers – Britian, China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia and the United States – have signed or ratified the treaty. Many other countries that rely on other nations’ nuclear weapons for their security, such as the 27 members of Nato (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation), and Australia, Japan and South Korea, have also not signed.

So why does the treaty matter given these states currently oppose it? And what effect can we expect the treaty to have on them?

While any treaty is technically only binding on the states that join it, the TPNW establishes a new international legal standard against which all nuclear policies will now be judged.

The treaty, in short, is a game-changer, and nuclear-armed and dependent countries have been put on notice. They know the treaty jeopardises their claimed right to continue to threaten the planet with their weapons, as well as their plans to modernise and maintain their nuclear arsenals indefinitely.

The strength of their opposition is a measure of the treaty’s importance. It will have implications for everything from defence policies and military plans to weapons manufacturing to financial investments in the companies that profit from making now illegal nuclear weapons.

For example, a growing number of banks, pension funds and insurance companies around the world are now divesting from companies that build nuclear weapons. These include the Norwegian Pension Fund (the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund), ABP (Europe’s largest pension fund), Deutsche Bank, Belgium’s largest bank KBC, Resona Holdings, Kyushu Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in Japan, and the Japanese insurance companies Nippon Life, Dai-ichi Life, Meiji-Yasuda and Fukoku Mutual.

Would joining the treaty mean nations like Australia, Japan, South Korea and Nato member nations have to end their military cooperation with nuclear-armed states like the United States?

No. There is nothing in the TPNW that prevents military cooperation with a nuclear-armed state, provided activities involving nuclear weapons are excluded. Countries like New Zealand and Kazakhstan have already demonstrated that joining the treaty is fully compatible with ongoing military cooperation with, respectively, the United States and Russia.

In a recent letter urging their governments to join the treaty, 56 former presidents, prime ministers and defence and foreign ministers from these nations said, “By claiming protection from nuclear weapons, we are promoting the dangerous and misguided belief that nuclear weapons enhance security. As states parties, we could remain in alliances with nuclear-armed states, as nothing in the treaty itself nor in our respective defence pacts precludes that. But we would be legally bound never under any circumstances to assist or encourage our allies to use, threaten to use or possess nuclear weapons. Given the very broad popular support in our countries for disarmament, this would be an uncontroversial and much-lauded move.”

The signatories include two former Nato secretaries-general, Willy Claes and Javier Solana.

Ban treaties have been proven to work with other outlawed weapons – landmines, cluster munitions and biological and chemical weapons. They have provided the basis and motivation for progressive efforts to control and eliminate these weapons. They are now significantly less produced, deployed and used, even by states that haven’t joined the treaties.

We can achieve the same result with nuclear weapons. As Hiroshima survivor Setsuko Thurlow said at the UN after the treaty was adopted, “This is the beginning of the end of nuclear weapons”. – The Conversation

747,748,https://punchng.com/power-sector-loses-n20-5bn-as-load-rejection-lingers/,"About N20.5bn revenue was lost by Nigeria’s power sector between January 1 and 22, 2021, as operators in the business complained that energy was still being rejected by distributors.

Data obtained from the Federal Ministry of Power on Friday showed that the sector lost N20.5bn within the first three weeks of the year.

Our correspondent also gathered that a total of 1,941 megawatts-hour/hour of electricity was constrained during this period, as this quantum of energy could not be generated on the national grid.

The major constraints that stopped the production of this quantum of power were insufficient gas supply, as well as lack of distribution and transmission infrastructure.

Further findings from the power ministry revealed that the average energy that was sent out during the period was 4,505MWH/H.

READ ALSO: Electricity grid collapses 27 times in three years

Also, peak power generated on the country’s grid within this three weeks was put at 5,584MW, as industry operators decried the persistent rejection of electricity by power distribution companies.

The General Manager, Market Operations, Transmission Company of Nigeria, Edmund Eje, stated that the widening revenue gap in the market had further made the Discos to drop electricity load.

Eje, who spoke at the just held virtual power dialogue, explained that the load rejection had impacted negatively on the machines of power generation and transmission companies.

He said, “As the market gap started widening, the Discos resorted to reducing their invoice monthly. How could that be effected? It was by reducing the amount of energy they take.

“By reducing the amount of energy you take, you are restricting the amount of energy to be evacuated from the transmission side.

“And it has to be understood by everybody in the power sector that energy consumed, generated and evacuated are done simultaneously because energy is not stored anywhere.”

He added, “Although we have new technologies coming out now where you can use batteries to store energy, I can tell you that as the generator is generating, transmission is evacuating it.

“And as it is being evacuated, the consumer takes it. So any imbalance within these three causes a lot of issues, most especially when the Discos drop load for whatever reason.”

The TCN official stated that despite the over 12,000MW installed generation and transmission capacities, there was a high amount of unutilised energy due to load rejection by power distributors.

He said, “And at such instances, the transmission company would battle to bring the grid to a steady state of transmission and as it does this, there is this signal to generation that there is imbalance and so they (generators) should drop load.

“This means that we have capacity that cannot be utilised because of the ripple effect from the distribution end. But most people tend to say there is evacuation problem, whereas we we have 12,954.4MW installed transmission capacity.”

Power distributors had repeatedly argued that it made no business sense to wheel power to locations where consumers show unwillingness to pay for the electricity they receive.

This, according to the Discos, was one reason why some quantum of energy evacuated to such locations were being rejected by the distributors.

Ahead of the delayed announcement, which customarily takes place in December, Kate Forbes said there would not be a public-sector pay freeze similar to that announced by the UK Government and staff would be offered a settlement that was “fair and affordable”.

In pre-budget consultations, the Finance Secretary said, sectors have stressed the need for targeted support, which she claims will be delivered when she addresses MSPs on Thursday.

In a statement released on Sunday, she also hinted at the extension of rates relief for businesses but said the Scottish Government currently has “limited resources” with which to offer such support due to the delay in the UK Government’s spending pledges announcement.

Ms Forbes said: “The budget on Thursday will create the conditions for Scotland to recover and renew.

“The budget will include innovative, targeted measures to help businesses and families get back on their feet and bolster our vital public services.

“I have already ruled out following the UK Government’s public-sector pay freeze and will set out details of a pay settlement that is both fair and affordable.”

The UK budget has been delayed until March by Chancellor Rishi Sunak, something Ms Forbes said at the time would cause “significant difficulties” in the process north of the border.

In an effort to secure cross-party support for the budget, Ms Forbes continued: “The global pandemic and the problems arising from Brexit combine to make these uniquely challenging times.

“This budget will help Scotland emerge as a globally competitive, fairer and greener country, and I urge all parties to work in the national interest to ensure it is passed by the Scottish Parliament.”

Business group CBI Scotland called for the Finance Secretary to focus on sustainability and skill in her announcement.

According to the group, the three key areas of focus should be support for businesses in the short term to protect jobs while investing in training for the future and looking at ways to transition to a net zero economy.

CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: “CBI Scotland argues that a budget focused on support, skills and sustainability can bolster Scotland’s short and long-term economic prospects.

“That means protecting the companies that will deliver growth, investing properly in our workforce and building a net zero economy that not only delivers a better environmental future, but an economic one too.

“Sustainability can be a competitive advantage for Scotland for years to come and deliver a real jobs boost at a time when we need it most.”","Budget will allow Scotland to recover and renew, says Finance Secretary",www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk

Osborne & Little, the upmarket wallpaper and furnishings firm co-founded by the former Chancellor's father, baronet Sir Peter Osborne, has borrowed £3.6 million from its bank through the coronavirus 'business interruption' loan scheme.

The loan is underwritten by the Government, meaning taxpayers would pick up the bill for up to 80 per cent of the debt if Osborne & Little was unable to repay the money.

The company also has made 'full use' of the Government's furlough scheme, asking the taxpayer to fund the wages of 'a significant proportion' of its 153 staff.

The company also borrowed $846,000 (£618,000) through the US government-backed Paycheck Protection Program loan scheme in America. George Osborne, 49, became a non-executive director last July.

The firm made a £542,000 pre-tax loss in the year to the end of March 2020 after sales fell six per cent to £29.1 million. Sales in the US, its biggest market representing 56 per cent of overall sales, fell two per cent to £16.3 million.

Before the company took out the loans, directors had warned there was 'material uncertainty' over the firm's ability to continue as a going concern and called the Covid-19 crisis 'an unprecedented economic shock'.

But they say they are confident the firm will return to profit over the 12 months to March 2021.

It's a two-generation approach to poverty that leans heavily on in-person services, including home visits and goal counseling for parents, provided at no cost to families.

When COVID-19 tore through the globe last spring, shuttering schools and businesses worldwide, its employees could have given up, contending that their mission was no longer realistic.

Instead, they chose to innovate.

The Colorado Springs nonprofit took its programming virtual, and its wrap-around services that help lift families out of poverty hit the road.

Moving school for young ones, especially infants and toddlers, online was a ""huge challenge,"" said Marty Kemmer-Contreras, director of community realizations for Community Partnership for Child Development — not only from a curriculum standpoint, but from an access standpoint. Many of the nonprofit's families didn't have devices or internet access at their homes.

So, they developed the ""stability bus,"" which delivered Chromebooks and ""learning lab"" kits, and essentials like diapers and formula, to its families.

The work brought with it both satisfaction and a sobering realization: Families were struggling to make ends meet.

""We realized there were rents that couldn't be paid, utilities, that kind of thing,"" Kemmer-Contreras said. ""The job loss was big. So many of our families work in the gig economy, many in hospitality.""

The organization used COVID relief funds to set up a fund of its own, to which its families could apply for help in covering the basics. Nearly 150 families received rental and utilities assistance.

Through it all, the nonprofit's donors remained faithful, regardless of personal struggles they may have been experiencing.

""It's unbelievable how Colorado Springs heeded the call,"" Kemmer-Contreras said. ""Our donations have been fantastic. People are seeing the need.""

The organization's goal is to ""break families out of the cycle of poverty — and something like the pandemic nips that in the bud.""

Being able to ""go forward with strength and resolve is what we need to do,"" she said — and the nonprofit can only do so with continued community support.

For those with generous hearts, ""supporting a campaign like Empty Stocking Fund or an organization (like CPCD) is the way to go.""","Empty Stocking Fund: When pandemic disrupted operations, Colorado Springs nonprofit got innovative",gazette.com
752,753,https://www.wkms.org/post/no-facts-little-law-beshear-responds-impeachment-petition,"Gov. Andy Beshear is asking a legislative committee to dismiss an impeachment petition against him. Petitioners say Beshear violated the Kentucky Constitution when he imposed restrictions during the pandemic, including mandatory closures of non-essential businesses.

In a 45-page response to the petition, Beshear notes that the courts have upheld many of his restrictions, and describes the petitioners as “political activists ostensibly unhappy with the Governor’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and their lack of success in court.”

“The Petition cites no facts and little law in a last-ditch effort to upend our constitutional separation of powers, hoping the General Assembly will ignore the judgments of the judicial branch as well as the will of the people in electing their chief executive,” the response reads.

The four petitioners are Jacob Clark of Grayson County, Tony Wheatley of Mercer County, Randall Daniel of Bullitt County and Andrew Cooperrider of Fayette County. They say Beshear violated their Constitutional rights, including the right to freedom of assembly and religious freedom, with his executive orders temporarily closing businesses and churches to in-person worship.

One petitioner, Cooperrider, refused to close his Lexington coffee shop to in-person dining in November and December, in defiance of Beshear’s executive order.

In his response, Beshear points to petitioners’ political activity, and “inflammatory” rhetoric against the governor on social media.

“The common denominator among the four is a pattern of attacking and even attempting to instill fear in the Governor and his family,” the response reads.

According to Beshear, Wheatley was one of the organizers of the May 24, 2020 protest against the governor’s coronavirus restrictions, which ended with a small group of protesters hanging Beshear in effigy outside the governor’s mansion. According to the Courier Journal, Wheatley was at the protest, but said he did not support the effigy.

The response also says Cooperrider is under investigation after a business owner reported him to the authorities for saying “wait until you see what I have planned for the Governor’s mansion in the next couple of weeks.” Beshear says Cooperrider told Kentucky State Police he did not have violent intent.

Impeachment is rare in Kentucky. According to Beshear, it has only been used eight times in Kentucky history, and never against a governor.

Since state Republican lawmakers have decided to form a committee in response to this impeachment petition against Beshear, two more impeachment petitions have been filed: one against Republican Rep. Robert Goforth, who allegedly hogtied and strangled his wife with an ethernet cable; and another against state Attorney General Daniel Cameron, for his handling of the Breonna Taylor investigation.","‘No Facts, Little Law’: Beshear Responds To Impeachment Petition",www.wkms.org

There are currently no inmates over 75 in Alberta jails. But vaccination for inmates became a political issue when federal official Opposition Leader Erin O’Toole questioned it earlier this month in a Tweet. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Older inmates at Alberta jails will be part of Phase 1B of vaccine roll-out In Alberta, residents age 75 and older will be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccination in Phase 1B, scheduled to begin next month. “This includes inmates over 75 in provincial correctional centres,” Alberta Health spokesman Tom McMillan confirmed this week in an email. “Details on how this will occur are being determined and will be shared once this Phase 1B is underway.” Alberta Justice said Friday that there are currently no inmates over the age of 75 in custody at provincial jails. McMillan said the province is working to vaccinate populations most vulnerable to severe outcomes from COVID-19 and the workers who serve them. The vaccine rollout is currently in Phase 1, which includes residents and staff at long-term care homes as well as certain health-care workers and paramedics.

McMillan re-affirmed Thursday that the province has not made any decisions over what groups, populations or communities will be part of Phase 2, which is scheduled to begin in April. He did not say whether or not the general inmate population is being considered. “We recognize that many Albertans would benefit from the vaccine and, as the minister of health noted, ‘we would like to vaccinate many, many more Albertans as soon as possible.’ We are currently receiving limited doses of the vaccine,” said McMillan. O’Toole made headlines earlier this month when his official Twitter account issued a tweet saying: “Not one criminal should be vaccinated ahead of any vulnerable Canadian or frontline health worker.” The message was posted alongside a CTV article stating federal inmates would begin to receive vaccinations. Kelly Dae Dash, a spokeswoman with Correctional Service Canada, said the department is expecting to vaccinate approximately 600 inmates in federal prisons during phase one of their rollout. “CSC medical staff used guidance developed by the (National Advisory Committee on Immunization) to determine which inmates would be offered access to the vaccine,” said Dash in an email. Drumheller Institution and Bowden Institution were among facilities included in phase one. Numbers posted to the department’s website show there have been 44 cases at the Drumheller Institution, two at the Bowden Institution, one at the Edmonton Institution and five at the Edmonton Institution for Women.

Jerrica Goodwin, press secretary for the premier, said Jason Kenney does not support vaccinating healthy inmates ahead of vulnerable populations.

 “That said, the government does recognize that there could be a small number of situations where a prisoner qualifies in line with general population criteria, such as old age or pre-existing conditions, that make them especially susceptible to adverse effects of COVID-19,” said Goodwin in an email. Robin Murray, executive director of the John Howard Society’s Edmonton chapter, said he hopes that when decisions are made regarding who should receive the vaccine, they are made for health reasons and not ideological ones. He said he trusts Alberta’s chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw and other policymakers will do so when the time comes. “This shouldn’t be a political or ideological question, if that makes sense. It’s a health question for sure,” said Murray. “I trust Dr. Hinshaw to say here’s where our vaccinations should go, without political interference.” Alberta Health spokesman Kerry Williamson said there are currently 120 active COVID-19 cases among inmates at the Edmonton Remand Centre, the largest jail in Alberta. There are an additional 265 inmates at the jail who have recovered and 70 who have been released with instructions on how to self-isolate. “Of note, 145 of those are community-acquired,” said Williamson Friday.

755,756,https://wtmj.com/national/2021/01/23/britains-boris-johnson-presses-biden-for-new-trade-deal-2/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson made clear to President Joe Biden on Saturday that he’s eager to forge a new U.S.-U.K. trade deal.

The push for a new deal came in a broad-ranging call between the two leaders that touched on the global response to the coronavirus pandemic as well as the Biden administration announcing this week that the U.S. would rejoin the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization, according to a statement from Downing Street.

A new trade agreement between the allies is a higher priority for Johnson than it is for Biden. The U.K. regained control over its national trade policy at the start of the month following the end of a post-Brexit transition period.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that the administration had no timeline for forging a new trade deal as Biden’s attention is largely focused on getting the coronavirus pandemic under control and pressing Congress to pass the president’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.

Janet Yellen, Biden’s Treasury secretary nominee, also signaled during her confirmation hearing earlier this week that Biden wasn’t eager to negotiate new trade deals.

“President Biden has been clear that he will not sign any new free trade agreements before the U.S. makes major investments in American workers and our infrastructure,” Yellen said.

Downing Street said Saturday that Biden and Johnson discussed “the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries,” and Johnson “reiterated his intention to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible.”

The White House in its own statement said that the two leaders spoke about combating climate change, containing COVID-19, and ensuring global health security as well as shared foreign policy priorities in China, Iran and Russia. But the statement notably made no mention of discussion on trade.

The call with Johnson was at least Biden’s third call with a foreign counterpart since Friday. The president spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Friday evening.

756,757,https://www.thebostonpilot.com/article.asp?Source=Popular&ID=189256,"CNA Staff, Jan 22, 2021 CNA.- President Joe Biden’s statement backing legal abortion on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade drew swift reaction from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, whose pro-life chairman said the no president of the United States should ever defend denying the right to life of unborn children.



“We strongly urge the president to reject abortion and promote life-affirming aid to women and communities in need,” the U.S. bishops’ Committee on Pro-Life Activities head Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City in Kansas said Jan. 22.



“It is deeply disturbing and tragic that any president would praise and commit to codifying a Supreme Court ruling that denies unborn children their most basic human and civil right, the right to life under the euphemistic disguise of a health service,” he said.



The U.S. bishops’ conference responded to the statement from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision which mandated permissive abortion laws nationwide.



The president and vice president stressed their commitment to legal abortion, saying “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to codifying Roe v. Wade and appointing judges that respect foundational precedents like Roe.”



Although Roe v. Wade was a critical pro-abortion rights decision, the statement did not mention abortion by name, preferring to use euphemisms such as “reproductive health” and “health care.”



“In the past four years, reproductive health, including the right to choose, has been under relentless and extreme attack,” they said. “As the Biden-Harris Administration begins in this critical moment, now is the time to rededicate ourselves to ensuring that all individuals have access to the health care they need.”



The U.S. bishops’ conference said the statement wrongly characterized the Roe v. Wade decision as “an advancement of women’s rights and health.” While the Biden-Harris statement did not mention religion, the bishops said Catholics cannot support abortion.



Biden has repeatedly emphasized his Catholicism, attending Mass the morning of his inauguration and citing St. Augustine of Hippo in his inaugural address. He has put a Pope Francis picture in the Oval Office.



Even on Biden’s first day in office, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki cited Biden’s Catholicism when asked questions about abortion.



At a Jan. 20 press briefing, Owen Jensen of EWTN News asked Psaki what Biden plans to do regarding the Hyde Amendment and the Mexico City Policy, which Biden has opposed because they limit abortion funding.



“Well, I think we’ll have more to say on the Mexico City Policy in the coming days,” Psaki said.



“But I will just take the opportunity to remind all of you that he (Biden) is a devout Catholic, and somebody who attends church regularly,” she told reporters. “He started his day with attending his church this morning.”



In the bishops’ conference statement, however, Archbishop Naumann emphasized Church teaching on abortion.



“I take this opportunity to remind all Catholics that the Catechism states, ‘Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable’,” he said.



The statement also emphasized politicians’ responsibilities to reject a right to abortion.



“Public officials are responsible for not only their personal beliefs, but also the effects of their public actions. Roe’s elevation of abortion to the status of a protected right and its elimination of state restrictions paved the way for the violent deaths of more than 62 million innocent unborn children and for countless women who experience the heartache of loss, abandonment, and violence,” said Naumann.



The president of the Franciscan University of Steubenville, Fr. Dave Pivonka, also reacted to the Biden-Harris declaration, saying their “aggressive pro-abortion statement … is saddening to Catholics worldwide. The policies they have promised to put forward are harmful to the dignity of the human person and are contrary to the teachings of the Church.”



Pope Francis has often rejected abortion as part of a “throwaway culture,” but some American pro-abortion rights advocates and politicians, and their supporters, have tried to claim the Pope has taken a non-confrontational approach at variance with most U.S. bishops.



On the day of Biden’s inauguration, Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles, in his role as president of the U.S. bishops’ conference, said he was praying for Biden. He noted areas of agreement and disagreement between the bishops and Biden.



“Catholic bishops are not partisan players in our nation’s politics,” Gomez said in a statement. “We are pastors responsible for the souls of millions of Americans and we are advocates for the needs of all our neighbors.”



“For the nation’s bishops, the continued injustice of abortion remains the ‘preeminent priority’,” he said, adding that “preeminent does not mean ‘only’,” and there are a wide variety of challenges and threats to human dignity facing the country today,” he said.



The U.S. bishops will engage with Biden with the aim of starting “a dialogue to address the complicated cultural and economic factors that are driving abortion and discouraging families,” Archbishop Gomez said.",US bishops urge Biden to reject abortion rights after 'deeply disturbing' statement,www.thebostonpilot.com
757,758,https://www.thebostonpilot.com/article.asp?ID=189252,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. (CNS) -- Over 40 top professionals from multiple fields came together for a virtual conference in mid-January to discuss how to live together in unity and promote the common good.



The Jan. 12-14 conference hosted at the University of Notre Dame had been planned for months, but its theme -- ""We Belong to Each Other,"" based on the words of St. Teresa of Kolkata -- became even more timely after the Jan. 6 violence at the U.S. Capitol.



The virtual gathering took the place of a fall conference sponsored annually by the university's de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture but was postponed last fall by the pandemic.



While many of the speakers bemoaned the inability to meet in person, the fact they could participate from their homes or offices likely enabled conference organizers to attract so many top experts in their fields of religion, philosophy, political science, education, medicine, economics, sociology and the arts.



Keynoting the conference was Archbishop José H. Gomez of Los Angeles, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.



He set the tone by observing that loving our neighbor is the answer to most of the difficulties in the world. However, the ""aggressively secular society"" has lost the traditional Christian-Judeo principle of a loving God who creates persons in his own image and calls them to love one another as he loves them, he observed.



""Without belief in a Creator who establishes values, we have no authority higher than our own politics and procedures,"" Archbishop Gomez explained. ""We are left with no solid foundation for our commitments to human dignity, freedom, equality and fraternity.""



Other speakers echoed this diagnosis, even those from secular institutions, such as author and New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, and Yuval Levin, author, journalist and political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. Both men concluded the culture's best chance of recovery is a resurgence in religious practice.



The current social and political crises in this country, Levin added, are due to the growing loss of trust in institutions, prompted by the realization that many of the people within those entities are untrustworthy themselves.



He said the solution is for the people working inside institutions to be reformed to realize they are not there for power or self-promotion; rather, their role is to focus on the duties of their positions and their obligations to their neighbors.



This love for one's neighbor has the long been modeled by Catholic health care, which was discussed by three physicians in a segment on ""Visit the Sick.""



Dr. Kristin Collier, director of the health, spirituality and religion program at the University of Michigan Medical School, said that ""relationship-centered care is best."" Thus, medical workers must be lovers of humanity who need to see their work as a gift from God that transforms the love of Christ into love for patients.



Dr. Lauris Kaldjian, director of programs in bioethics and humanities in the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, observed: ""As Christian health care professionals, we see why health care is such a great place to be in the sense that we have this remarkable privilege and opportunity to be used by God to be a true blessing to those who are in this moment of crisis.""



Dr. Aaron Kheriaty, director of the medical ethics program at the University of California at Irvine School of Medicine, related that all of society has suffered during the pandemic, not just from contracting the virus, but from the lockdown that has resulted in increased suicide, depression, and alcohol and drug abuse.



While doctors can help in many ways, he stressed that even ordinary people have the ability to bring healing to suffering people by finding ways to be in solidarity with one another.



Addressing that solidarity was a conference session on mothers and children. Dr. Monique Chireau Wubbenhorst, an obstetrician/gynecologist with the U.S. Agency for International Development observed that right now, huge amounts of money are spent on contraception, and that is not working. Further, abortion is not health care.



The best way to help women and children, she said, is to encourage women to get into prenatal care as soon as possible, and then to give them access to good child care. She also cited incentives such as tax breaks for marriage and childbirth as a way to rebuild a society that promotes the common good and cares for the vulnerable.



In that same session, Sister Virginia Joy Cotter, a Sister of Life, who is director of the Respect Life Office of the Archdiocese of New York, spoke about the absence of love as the biggest reason women consider abortion because they feel alone and helpless. The Sisters of Life help heal these women by accompanying them with ""a love that casts out fear,"" she said.



Other sessions on racism, poverty, hospitality, the disabled, and the anthropology of the human person echoed the message Archbishop Gomez gave in his keynote address that every person is called to love and care for others, particularly the weak and vulnerable.



As he told the conference, ""We can change our country and we can change the world. We can help our neighbors to know this God, and to know his love.""","Cause of many crises today is 'absence of love,' secularization, speakers say",www.thebostonpilot.com
758,759,https://www.thebostonpilot.com/article.asp?Source=Trending&ID=189254,"WASHINGTON (CNS) -- When they vote, Catholics must weigh many issues of very grave moral consequence ""in good conscience,"" but ""no Catholic in good conscience can favor abortion,"" San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore J. Cordileone said Jan. 21.



""'Right to choose' is a smokescreen for perpetuating an entire industry that profits from one of the most heinous evils imaginable,"" he said in a statement. ""Our land is soaked with the blood of the innocent, and it must stop.""



Archbishop Cordileone's remarks came in response to comments by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, during a Jan. 18 episode of a podcast hosted by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democrats' 2016 presidential nominee.



Pelosi, a Catholic, accused pro-life voters who supported President Donald Trump in the 2020 election and oppose his recent impeachment by the House of ""being willing to sell the whole democracy down the river for that one issue"" -- abortion.



The 80-year-old lawmaker from San Francisco, who has a 100% rating on the issue from NARAL Pro-Choice America, said the pro-lifers' votes caused her ""great grief as a Catholic.""



News reports said her comments came when she and Clinton were discussing the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol and a new Washington Post-ABC News poll showing that 70% of Americans say Trump was responsible for the riot. Pelosi pointed to another poll that said over 40% of Americans do not support removing Trump from office.



Unlike Pelosi, Archbishop Cordileone said, he ""will not presume to know what was in the minds of Catholic voters when they voted for the presidential candidate of their choice, no matter who their preferred candidate was.""



""To begin with the obvious: Nancy Pelosi does not speak for the Catholic Church,"" he said. ""She speaks as a high-level important government leader and as a private citizen. And on the question of the equal dignity of human life in the womb, she also speaks in direct contradiction to a fundamental human right that Catholic teaching has consistently championed for 2,000 years.""



""Christians have always understood that the commandment, 'Thou shall not kill,' applies to all life, including life in the womb,"" he said, adding: ""Pope Francis continues this unbroken teaching.""



Catholics ""will continue to speak out on behalf of those who have no voice to speak for themselves and reach out to, comfort and support those who are suffering the scars of the abortion experience,"" the archbishop said. ""We will do so, until our land is finally rid of this despicable evil.""



Archbishop Cordileone also referenced a statement issued Jan. 20 by the president of the U.S. Bishops Conference, Los Angeles Archbishop José H. Gomez, as Joe Biden prepared to be inaugurated as the nation's 46th president.



Archbishop Gomez prayed God will grant Biden the wisdom and courage to lead the nation and expressed hope the incoming administration ""will work with the church and others of goodwill"" to ""address the complicated cultural and economic factors that are driving abortion and discouraging families.""



For the U.S. bishops, the ""continued injustice of abortion"" remains the ""preeminent priority,"" he said, but ""'preeminent' does not mean 'only.' We have deep concerns about many threats to human life and dignity in our society.""



In reiterating ""the declaration of the U.S. bishops that abortion is for Catholics the 'preeminent priority' ... he acted rightly and collaboratively in his role as USCCB president, and I am grateful to him for doing so,"" Archbishop Cordileone said.



""Preeminent does not mean 'only,' of course,"" he repeated. ""There are certainly many evils we must confront and many goods we must pursue. In his inaugural speech ... President Biden gave a moving call to unity and healing. He offered what I would call a 'Litany of Compassion' -- bringing before the eyes of the nation the suffering of people across a wide spectrum of issues.""



""In my experience, advocates for unborn children also work diligently to be of service in many of these causes as well,"" Archbishop Cordileone said. ""Speaker Pelosi has chosen this week to impugn the motives of millions of Catholics and others for choosing to make voting on the issue of abortion their priority and accuses them of 'selling out democracy.' This is not the language of unity and healing. She owes these voters an apology.""



Catholic News Service submitted a request Jan. 22 to Pelosi's press office seeking a comment from her about the archbishop's statement, but there was no immediate reply.



Meanwhile, President Joe Biden, who also is a Catholic, and Vice President Kamala Harris marked the 48th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion with a statement saying their administration ""is committed to codifying Roe v. Wade and appointing judges that respect foundational precedents like Roe.""



The Jan. 22 statement does not use the word ""abortion,"" but talks about ""reproductive health"" and protecting women's access to ""health care.""



""In the past four years, reproductive health, including the right to choose, has been under relentless and extreme attack,"" they said Jan. 22. ""We are deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care -- including reproductive health care -- regardless of income, race, ZIP code, health insurance status, or immigration status.""



They added: ""Now is the time to rededicate ourselves to ensuring that all individuals have access to the health care they need.""



The statement brought a swift reaction from several national pro-life leaders.



""President Biden & VP Harris just released a statement on the 48th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, absurdly calling it 'foundational.' Wrong. What is truly foundational is the right to LIFE of every American, as stated in the Declaration of Independence,"" the Susan B. Anthony List tweeted.



""Joe Biden marks the anniversary of Roe v Wade by saying he is 'deeply committed' to the intentional destruction of innocent life through the heinous practice of abortion,"" said a tweet from CatholicVote.org.



Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Defense and Education Fund, tweeted: ""Abortion isn't healthcare. It is heartbreaking but not surprising that on the day we commemorate the loss of 60+ million Americans to abortion the new administration is already aggressively leaning into abortion extremism.""

759,760,https://punchng.com/senator-demands-probe-of-soldiers-herdsmens-harassment-of-ogun-villagers/,"The Senator representing Ogun West Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Tolu Odebiyi, has asked the Federal Government, military and police authorities to probe the alleged harassment of his constituents by soldiers and Fulani herdsmen.

There were media reports on Saturday that Fulani herdsmen allegedly engaged the services of some soldiers to beat up farmers in some communities in Yewa land in Ogun State, for stopping the cattle from grazing over their farmland.

The report added that many farmers and their family members were thoroughly beaten and wounded by the soldiers during the unfortunate invasion.

Odebiyi, in a statement by his media office on Saturday, therefore demanded that a thorough investigation be carried out on the matter without further delay.

The Senator also lamented the incessant cases of harassment, brutalization and maiming traceable to herders in Yewa land.

He said, “It is morally wrong to allow herders to graze on people’s farms unchecked, to the point that law abiding citizens are rendered hapless.

“This sends a dangerous sign, in addition to undermining the credibility of the government.”

The Senator specifically called on the Brigade Commander of the 35 Artillery Brigade, Alamala, Abeokuta and the Commissioner of Police, Ogun State Command, to urgently look into the matter.

Odebiyi said a thoroughl investigation was necessary “in order to stop the inimical, unpleasant and nasty situation reverberating around the Yewa villages”

He listed villages where the herdsmen constantly harassed to include, Ateru, Moro, Ologun, Agbon, Igbota, Ogunba-Aiyetoro, Oke-Odo, Ibore, Gbokoto, Iselu, Ijale, Ohunbe, Igbeme, Owode-Ketu, Igan-Alade, Lashilo, Oja Odan, Ateru, Moro, Ologun, Iyana Meta, Igbooro, Egbeda and Kuse.

Odebiyi noted that residents of the Ogun West Senatorial District have gone through a lot of trauma in the hands of military and other strike forces.

He added that it was the responsibility of the Military and the Police to protect the lives and property of the citizenry and bring peace to the polity.

761,762,https://www.fox7austin.com/news/jennifer-kesse-disappearance-family-says-its-close-to-answers-in-15-year-old-cold-case,"The parents of Jennifer Kesse say they are ""closer than ever"" to uncovering answers in the disappearance of their daughter, who vanished 15 years ago from Central Florida, in a case that has long baffled investigators.

""We may have answers this year,"" said the woman's father, Drew Kesse, noting that new information received in recent weeks has prompted him to expand his team of private detectives leading the investigation.

""We're making a lot of headway and we're closer than ever to bringing Jennifer home,"" he said.

On the morning of Jan. 24, 2006, Jennifer Kesse, of Orlando, Fla., failed to report to her job as a finance manager at a well-known timeshare company. The 24-year-old woman was last heard from at around 10 p.m. the night before when she spoke by phone with her family and boyfriend from inside her condominium.

Investigators say they believe Kesse was targeted after leaving her home for work on the morning of the 24th. Her car, a black Chevy Malibu, was found abandoned two days later at an apartment complex in a high-crime area about one mile away from her condo. Authorities uncovered surveillance video showing an unknown person parking Kesse’s car near the pool area of that complex at 12 noon on January 24. The person of interest – believed to be male and dressed in workman’s clothes – has never been identified and no arrests have ever been made in the case.

""This person holds the key to solving the case,"" said Michael Torretta, a former federal agent and private investigator hired by the Kesse family.

The Kesse family sued the Orlando Police Department in 2018 for all the records to date in their daughter’s case. Frustrated by the police handling of the investigation, the Kesses demanded the files be released to them in a legal battle that was unprecedented in a missing person case. An agreement was reached, and the Kesses in turn received some 16,000 pages of records, which Fox News examines in its true crime podcast, ""House of Broken Dreams: the Jennifer Kesse story.""

The podcast, which debuted Nov. 12, received more than one million downloads in its first month. After the podcast's release, Drew Kesse said he and his team received credible new information in the case. Kesse declined to elaborate on details given the sensitive nature of the investigation.

""Everyday there are active interviews and actions being taken to find the people responsible for taking Jennifer or the people with the information to piece it all together,"" said Kesse. ""It's painstaking work.""

Evidence photos previously obtained by the Fox News Investigative Unit suggest a violent struggle took place on the hood of the young woman’s car. Excerpts of police files also reveal that authorities immediately suspected a physical assault on the hood. Detective Julius Gause of the Orlando Police Department wrote of the police at the scene, ""While observing the front of the victim's vehicle, these detectives observed what appeared to have been someone being pushed across the head of the vehicle.""

""It looked like someone was thrown down on the top of the hood – arms spread out and then dragged back almost like off the hood to the point where you can almost see fingers scribbling down the hood,"" Drew Kesse told Fox News.

In an open letter to their daughter on the 15th anniversary of her disappearance, the Kesses, who maintain a GoFundMe page for the investigation, said they remain ""relentless"" in their pursuit of answers.

""We will not cease until we have found her, for the good or the bad. Jennifer is loved by us, her family, so many friends as well as strangers around our country and the world,"" the family wrote.

Prosecutors asked a judge on Friday to keep the man, Garret Miller, in jail ahead of a court appearance, according to court records.

On Wednesday they revealed five criminal charges against Miller in the District Court of the District of Columbia, including for making death threats and trespassing offenses.

In a court filing prosecutors said social media images were posted by Miller and appeared to announce his trip to the Capitol and threaten the life of Ocasio-Cortez, as well as a Capitol Police officer.

Miller made numerous threats online, they said, including one in which he commented ""next time we bring the guns"" on a Twitter video showing rioters exiting a Capitol building.

As rioters broke into the Capitol, Ocasio-Cortez worried that her colleagues in Congress might divulge her location to the mob, putting her at risk for kidnapping or worse, according to an Instagram Live video she recorded in the week after the invasion of the Capitol buildings.

Ocasio-Cortez also said she experienced ""a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die"" on 6 January, adding that she couldn't get into specifics for security reasons, according to a Washington Post account of the video.

""I did not know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive.""

Abda’s, a coffee shop in Northwich, Cheshire, was hit by flooding on Thursday. By the time staff arrived at the scene, the damage was done.

The shop now requires a full refit, while stock – including tea, coffee, spices and syrups – has also been ruined by the water.

“Everything we have all worked for over the past three years is completely destroyed,” baker Sophie France, 21, told the PA news agency.

“All we’ve managed to save so far is our beautiful coffee machine – thank goodness – our grinders and a box of gift vouchers as they were above the water level.

“We have lost the majority of our stock – all of our teas, coffee, spices, syrups, literally everything. All of our furniture is ruined.

“The shop is going to need a full refit to overcome the damage from the water and also sewage as it was the drains around us which overflowed.”

Northwich is one of many areas affected by floods as a result of Storm Christoph, with residents in parts of England being urged to prepare for further flooding.

Residents hit by recent flooding in Wales meanwhile will receive between £500 and £1,000 in support, the Welsh Government has announced.

For staff at Abda however, a GoFundMe page which has already raised more than £7,000 has provided light in a difficult moment.

“The night of the flooding, I set up a GoFundMe with help from Chloe (Barlow) and Claire (Dutton) to bring our shop back and to support our boss (Abda Obeid-Findley), who does everything she physically can to support us through everything,” said Ms France.

“We have been so overwhelmed with all of the support – our customers and families have been so unbelievably generous and supportive, donating hundreds of pounds each of their own money.

“We’ve always been so proud of our community at Abda, we truly are a family and all of our customers are like our closest friends.

“We really cannot thank them enough. We are a very small team and honestly couldn’t get through this without them. We are eternally grateful.

“We have also received incredible support from other local businesses offering free labour, help with electrics, furniture/furnishings – it’s incredible and we can’t believe how this has brought people together.”

The staff are planning to honour those who have donated by displaying their names in the shop once it is newly decorated.

766,767,https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/officials-responding-to-probable-covid-19-community-case-in-northland/,"Health officials are responding to a new case of coronavirus in the community in Northland.

It is understood the case involves a woman who was released from an MIQ facility about five days ago. Arrivals get tested on about the 12th day of a 14-day stay in managed isolation and are able to leave if the test is negative.

But it is possible the person was infected in the facility after her last test and was incubating Covid when she left.

Hipkins and Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield will give more details at a press conference at the Beehive at 4pm today.

The last case of community transmission in New Zealand was on November 18.

Covid-19 modeller Professor Michael Plank said it was possible the virus was passed from one infected person to another in a managed isolation facility.

""One of the risks we've always been aware of is someone arrives with the virus, but then they pass it on to someone else in quarantine, perhaps near the end of their stay,"" said Plank, of the University of Canterbury and Te Punaha Matatini.

""That's one possible way the virus can leak out. I'm not saying that's what happened in this case, but it's a possibility, because it would be unlikely for someone to be incubating the virus for that length of time.""

Covid 19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said there was not yet any evidence of actual community ""transmission"" in Northland. ""It's still most likely this is a border case.""

At today's 1pm Covid update, the Ministry of Health announced there had been eight new Covid cases in managed isolation since Friday.

The cases came from South Africa (2), the UK, United Arab Emirates, the US (2), Ethiopia and India. Four travelled via UAE and Malaysia.

One previously reported case had recovered, the ministry said.

Tests have now detected 36 people arriving in New Zealand with highly contagious strains of the virus since they emerged late last year: 29 with the UK variant and seven with the South African variant.

In the past fortnight, 17 more people were in quarantine facilities infected with the variants.

Whole genome sequencing had identified 11 samples of B.1.1.7 (known as the UK variant) and six samples of B.1.3.5.1 (known as the South Africa variant).

The ministry warned the strains would continue to show up in managed isolation facilities across New Zealand.

The Government has introduced pre-flight testing from most countries to reduce the number of people arriving at the border with Covid-19. Covid tests are given to people on the day of arrival, as well as day three and day 12.

There are currently 79 active cases in quarantine and the total number of confirmed cases is 1927.

The total number of tests processed by laboratories to date is 1,487,234.

The seven-day rolling average up to yesterday is 3335 tests processed.

767,768,https://www.dawn.com/news/1603038,"WITH the chapter now closed on the Trump presidency, the eyes of many in the international community — particularly the Palestinians and all those who wish to see a just settlement for them — will be on Washington to see if Joe Biden can bring a semblance of neutrality to the Arab-Israeli dispute.

The Trump era was of course one where Israel was given royal treatment by America, while the Palestinians were treated with disdain. The so-called deal of the century, a failed Trumpian solution to the dispute, was roundly rejected by the Palestinians as it sought to reward Israel for its decades of land grabbing and violence, and limit the Arabs to ‘reservations’ on their ancestral land. However, with Mr Biden in the driving seat, there may be a change in tone, if not substance, from Washington.

Israel, in the meantime, seems committed to illegally devouring more and more Arab land and creating ‘facts on the ground’. As reported by Israeli NGO Peace Now, Tel Aviv has issued tenders for 2,500 settler homes in the occupied territories, a move that is considered illegal under international law. The development is apparently aimed at the Israeli election, due in March, as Benjamin Netanyahu seeks to cling to power and fend off challenges to the premiership from right-wing challengers by appeasing hard-line voters.

While on the record Mr Biden has condemned Israeli settlements, members of his administration have said there is no plan to reverse Donald Trump’s move to recognise the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. It would be naive to hope for a complete turnaround in US policy in favour of the Palestinians as Mr Biden as well as his vice president are committed Israel supporters, as are most members of the American political establishment. However, it is hoped that the new US leader will at least temper some of the more overtly pro-Israel policies of his predecessor. Specifically, the expansion of illegal settlements must end, while Israel’s brutal treatment of Palestinians, particularly its frequent savage forays into Gaza, cannot continue.

The two-state solution is indeed on life support, thanks largely to Israeli impunity and America’s indulgence of its favourite Middle Eastern client. Yet if the peace process is to be revived, then the Palestinians must get a fair deal which promises them a viable state safe from the predatory attacks of Israel. If this formula is ignored, more turbulence is in store for the region.",Israeli land grab,www.dawn.com

Dozens of teachers are offering tutorials for up to £40 an hour on video link Zoom, with some breaking rules that ban them from taking on private work in school hours.

This newspaper revealed last year how some teachers were exploiting the closure of schools by making extra money tutoring. Our exposé today shows the practice is still rife.

Several spoke of their availability during school hours to an undercover reporter posing as a parent, with one admitting: ‘I have a much reduced timetable at the moment.’

Another, who said she was the head of a maths department, said she would be able to tutor in school hours until lockdown was over because she had ‘free periods’.

Within minutes of logging on to TutorHunt, a website that connects tutors with parents, a reporter was bombarded with messages from maths and English teachers.

Most said they were only available to work outside school hours but many took a different approach.

Adam, a maths teacher in Yorkshire charging £31 an hour for lessons, said: ‘Yes, I can do during school hours currently as I have a much reduced timetable at the moment. 'Following the lockdown, I’ll be available weekday evenings and weekends.’

He declined to comment once we revealed our investigation.

Another maths teacher, a department head at a London Academy school, charging £40 an hour for tuition, said: ‘When we’re in lockdown I can do school hours. When lockdown is over, I will be able to do physical lessons but outside school hours.’

She said she could tutor from 9am to 10am on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays, plus Wednesdays from 1.30pm to 2.30pm.

When we approached her for comment, she said she would face ‘a disciplinary’ if she was exposed – before deleting her TutorHunt account.

In Birmingham, Rashida, a teacher charging £25 an hour, said she would be able to do private tuition during school hours on Monday and Thursday. A request for comment went unanswered.

Last night, Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign For Real Education, said moonlighting in school hours is ‘immoral’.

He added: ‘For some teachers, there is clearly a financial incentive in keeping schools closed but it is the poorest children who lose out because their parents will not be able to afford this kind of tutoring.’

A Department for Education spokesman said last night: ‘Teachers can’t take on additional contracts of work for any time they are required to be available for work with their school.

The party’s education spokeswoman Beatrice Wishart MSP has written to Education Secretary John Swinney calling on him to introduce urgent measures to employ qualified supply teachers to provide extra support for children who would benefit from catch-up support and extra one-on-one learning.

She said that such a catch-up mechanism “could help dampen the worst impacts of the pandemic on learning”.

It comes after Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) general secretary Larry Flanagan called for “the rapid employment of supply teachers currently seeking work to provide additional support to those pupils struggling to engage with remote learning”.

In her letter, Ms Wishart wrote: “Teachers are working flat out to give pupils the best education they can. But supply teachers are telling me that they have consistently been underemployed since the start of the pandemic.

“I am writing to urge you to immediately lend your support to the introduction of new measures to employ qualified supply teachers to provide extra support for pupils who would benefit from catch-up support and extra one-on-one learning.

“I believe such a new catch-up mechanism, rooted in the judgment of class teachers, could help dampen the worst impacts of the pandemic on learning.”

Most pupils are currently taking part in online learning, with only those deemed vulnerable and the children of key workers attending school.

Ms Wishart said that the loss of routine, time spent with friends and full access to normal learning has been hard, and “children have missed out on so much over the past year”.

She added: “The evidence I am receiving is that supply teachers have the capacity to help bridge some of that gap, both during the current period of remote learning, (and) also once schools return.

“They have valuable skills and experience, and can provide precious additional support. We should be looking to bring in every helping hand available.

“The nationwide package agreed in the spring for supply teachers helped with their initial predicament.

“But I believe there is now an urgent need to establish new catch-up mechanisms, and that supply teachers can be a part of this.”

Mr Swinney, who is also Deputy First Minister, said: “The number of full time equivalent teachers is at its highest since 2008 and since the start of the pandemic our additional funding has led to 1,400 teachers and over 200 support staff being appointed.

“Last week we allocated an additional £45 million to councils to support schools and families.

“That funding, which is sufficient to fund 2,000 additional teachers, can be used to recruit additional staff including supply teachers.”",Draft in supply teachers to give pupils catch-up support – Liberal Democrats,www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk

The incident is being treated as a criminal investigation, according to police, who said they began receiving calls at about 12:35 a.m. regarding an email that had been sent out via “plusportals.com,” which is a vendor used by the district for students. Officials said the initial email had been sent to about 5,000 people and contained racial slurs and a threat against a school in the city.

A second email was sent out about a half-hour later. It included a date (Jan. 24) on which the threatened incident was to take place, along with extremely graphic images and violent videos that appeared to be taken from the internet.

“The Gardner Police Department checked the schools to ensure they were secure and no threats were located at this time,” said Sgt. Jeffrey LaBonte in a press release. “The police department is working with the school department and the city’s technology department to investigate this matter and will continue to do our best to ensure the student’s and staff’s safety.”

District officials were “horrified” at the emails that were sent through a student's school email account, according to a post on the Gardner Public Schools Facebook page.

“Someone was able to do this through a feature of our family communication tool,” they wrote. “This feature has since been disabled.”

School officials are working with police to identify the author of the emails, according to post.

“Messages of hate and violence are not tolerated in our school community,” the post reads. “At this time, we ask our families and the public at large to know that the owner of the email account is not necessarily the author of these emails. Please let the professionals in our district and police department investigate properly and thoroughly.”

Officials said that the principals of each school in the district will be reaching out to families and staff to ensure they have access to immediate support if it is deemed necessary.

“While some staff will be needed to help with the investigation, our primary focus will be to support our students, staff and families,” the post reads. “Seeing such graphic images and messages of hate can be traumatic for any of us, especially in these times of civil unrest and violence. The district's priority is to meet our community's social-emotional needs.”

Officials at Gardner High School responded to the incident in a post on their Facebook page.

“Unfortunately, many students and parents are reporting they received a very inappropriate email last night, appearing to be sent from a school email account,” the post reads. “We want to apologize for the graphic content of this email. We are working closely with the Gardner Police Department to investigate this and to determine the origin of the email. Again, our apologies and we will keep you updated as more information becomes available.”

Word of the disturbing emails spread quickly across social media, with many local parents advising others to delete the emails before their children accessed their accounts.

“Get into your child’s school email and erase them before they open them,” wrote Michelle Ann Spofford. “You don’t want your child to see this, trust me.”",Gardner police investigate after disturbing emails sent to students,www.thegardnernews.com
772,773,https://redstate.com/streiff/2021/01/23/jihadi-wife-who-claimed-to-be-american-gets-a-reality-check-n315161,"In 2014, a Yemeni woman named Hoda Muthana, who thought she was American, left a comfortable middle-class life in Alabama. She withdrew from college, used her tuition money to fly to Syria. She started generating ISIS propaganda of the death-to-America variety. She married a terrorist. When he was killed in combat she married another terrorist and spawned a terrorist-in-training.

By late 2016, her Twitter antics of inciting violence against Americans had attracted the attention of the Obama State Department which revoked her passport. The same commentary escaped the ever vigilant eyes of the Twitter censors who were too busy suspending conservatives to worry about that platform being used to spread terrorist propaganda.

By 2017, ISIS was reeling from a series of defeats. Muthana was a widow again. She was captured by Kurdish fighters and sent to a refugee camp. And she wanted to come home. Muthana says her family in Alabama were deeply conservative and placed restrictions on her movements and interactions, factors she claims contributed to her radicalisation. “You want to go out with your friends and I didn’t get any of that. I turned to my religion and went in too hard. I was self-taught and thought whatever I read, it was right. “I look back now and I think I was very arrogant. Now I’m worried about my son’s future. In the end I didn’t have many friends left, because the more I talked about the oppression of Isis the more I lost friends. I was brainwashed once and my friends are still brainwashed.”

 …

 Muthana said she had not been in contact with US officials since her capture. “I would tell them please forgive me for being so ignorant, and I was really young and ignorant and I was 19 when I decided to leave. I believe that America gives second chances. I want to return and I’ll never come back to the Middle East. America can take my passport and I wouldn’t mind.”

This whole story reminded me of the Tooter Turtle cartoon series that ran on Saturday mornings back when I was very much younger. Tooter was never satisfied with what he was and each week prevailed upon Mr. Wizard to change him into something more exciting. When things ended up badly, he always begged Mr. Wizard to bring him home. The video is cued up to the punchline.

We don’t know how the Obama administration would have reacted to her plea abut as a Muslim of terrorist disposition we can imagine they would have dispatched a LearJet to bring her home to a tickertape parade. Not so with President Trump.

Her father sued on her behalf in federal court and to the shock of many, District Judge Reggie Walton, who could be the archetype of the NeverTrump Democrat federal judge, ruled that the federal government was correct. That Muthana was not a US citizen. That her spawn was not a US citizen. And that she had no right or expectation to ever set foot in this country again.

A federal judge ruled Thursday that Hoda Muthana, a US-born woman who left the country to join ISIS, is not an American citizen, and therefore the government has no obligation to facilitate her return or that of her 2-year-old son. Judge Reggie Walton said there was sufficient evidence that Muthana had been born while her father, who once represented Yemen in the United Nations, still had diplomatic status in the US. Federal regulations and international law state that children of foreign diplomats born in the US are not subject to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees birthright citizenship, because they are born under the jurisdiction of another country. Walton also ruled that Muthana’s father could not provide financial support to his daughter and grandson, who was born in territory under ISIS control and whom he has never met, without being subject to charges of providing material support to terrorism.

The case was appealed and last week the D.C. Circuit upheld Walton’s decision. This is from a writer at Reason’s Volokh Conspiracy who has a severe case of sand-in-the-panties over a terrorist being barred from entering the US because libertarian.

…In a unanimous decision issued today, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled against her when it upheld the district court’s decision below that had denied her citizenship claim. Judge Rao argued that because the U.S. government was not notified of the loss of diplomatic status for Muthana’s father before her birth, Hoda Muthana did not attain citizenship by virtue of her birth on American soil. Even though the U.S. government treated Muthana as a citizen from at least 2005 (when it issued her first passport) until 2016 (when it cancelled her then-current passport, claiming that she had been issued a passport in error), the circuit court refused to grant equitable relief. “The Executive has no authority to confer citizenship on Hoda outside of the naturalization rules created by Congress. Nor do the courts have an equitable power to grant citizenship,” Judge Rao wrote in her opinion in a rather conclusory manner.

Hopefully, this brings this saga to an end. Like so many sad stories, the wounds are entirely self-inflicted. If the injured person had done nothing at all, they would have been fine.

The FBI says Garret Miller was among those who pushed past police to get inside the Capitol building.

Evidence shows Miller bragged about it on social media and posted ""assassinate AOC"" in reference to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Miller made his first appearance in federal court Friday. There will be another hearing next week. He’s the latest North Texan arrested for his role in the violence on the Capitol.

The FBI says the 34-year-old not only broadcast his role in the January 6th Capitol attack on social media but also bragged about it afterward and threatened a congresswoman.

The FBI received a referral from law enforcement about a video from inside the U.S. Capitol building posted on his now-suspended Twitter account.

The FBI says Miller posted images online showing him inside the Capitol.

Capitol surveillance footage also appears to show Miller among a group of people that pushed through capitol police officers to get into the building.

The criminal complaint says Miller later tried to take credit for his role in the riot. When someone tried to pin the blame on so-called ""paid infiltrators."" He posted, ""nah, we stormed it."" He later posted, ""next time, we bring the guns.""

That same day, U.S. House Member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: ""impeach.""

The congresswoman tweeted Friday night following Miller’s arrest: ""On one hand you have to laugh, and on the other know that the reason they were this brazen is because they thought they were going to succeed.""

Miller is now in federal custody and charged with unlawfully entering a federal building, disorderly conduct, and obstructing an official proceeding.

The criminal complaint alleges that Miller was highly critical of the Capitol police officer who shot and killed insurrectionist Ashli Babbitt, going as far to say ""we going to get a hold of him and hug his neck with a nice rope.""","Richardson man arrested for role in Capitol riot, threatening to assassinate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez",www.fox32chicago.com

The Archdiocese of Madrid confirmed Jan. 21 that Father Ruben Perez Ayala, a priest at the Church of Our Lady of La Paloma, died in the early hours of the morning due to internal hemorrhaging he suffered after the blast.



The archdiocese also shared an interview Father Perez shortly gave before his priestly ordination in June, in which he said that his experience at the seminary taught him that ""happiness is not in living for oneself, but in giving oneself to others.""



According to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, Father Perez's death brought the death toll from the explosion to four.



David Santos Munoz, 35, an electrician, died in the Jan. 20 explosion after he was called in to inspect the boiler room because of a strong smell of gas. Munoz, a married father of four, was an active member of the parish.



Two unnamed men also died, and 10 people were injured in the blast, El Pais reported.



Cardinal Carlos Osoro Sierra of Madrid, who rushed to the parish shortly after the explosion, mourned the death of Father Perez in a message on his Twitter account.



""The young priest Ruben Perez Ayala, who I ordained just six months ago, died this evening,"" the cardinal tweeted. ""I am grateful for his life of dedication to Christ and his church. I pray for his family. I also pray for those who died after the explosion at La Paloma and for all those affected.""



According to the archdiocese, the parish center housed the priests' apartments, as well as parish and local Caritas offices.



In a WhatsApp message to Catholic News Service Jan. 21, Father Gabriel Benedicto, pastor of Our Lady of La Paloma, said, ""I am well. It's been a long day, but God helps us.""



Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Vatican secretary of state, conveyed Pope Francis' ""closeness and affection"" in a statement released by the Vatican Jan. 20.



The pope ""raises prayers to the Lord and commends to his mercy especially the eternal rest of the victims, as well as the injured and their families,"" Cardinal Parolin wrote.



Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he expressed his ""support and solidarity"" in a phone call with Madrid Mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida.



""We send our condolences and affection to the families of the dead and the wounded,"" he tweeted.



Martinez-Almeida, who frequently updated reports about the explosion on his Twitter account, also expressed condolences to the victims' families.

The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, and the cover artwork featured a still from the movie. During the sessions, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and later claimed that he recalled almost nothing of the production. Musically, Station to Station was a transitional album for Bowie, developing the funk and soul music of his previous release, Young Americans, while presenting a new direction towards synthesizers and motorik rhythms that was influenced by German electronic bands such as Neu! and Kraftwerk. This trend would culminate in some of his most acclaimed work, the so-called ""Berlin Trilogy"", recorded with Brian Eno in 1977–79. Bowie himself said that Station to Station was ""a plea to come back to Europe for me"". The album's lyrics reflected his preoccupations with Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleister Crowley, mythology, and religion. Blending funk and krautrock, romantic balladry, and occultism, Station to Station has been described as ""simultaneously one of Bowie's most accessible albums and his most impenetrable"". Preceded by the single ""Golden Years"", it made the top five in both the UK and US charts. In 2012, the album was ranked No. 324 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

People aged 0ver 70 in Scotland will be invited to have the Covid-19 vaccination from next week.

Those aged between 70 and 79 have been told by the Scottish Government to look out for blue envelopes sent to their homes from Monday. 

 As the inoculation programme moves through priority groups, several health board areas are beginning to send out letters telling those in the age group when they will receive their first dose of the Covid-19 jab. 

 Health Secretary Jeane Freeman urged people to look out for the ""very distinctive"" envelopes, which are being given priority by Royal Mail. 

 A new booking system is also being used by several health boards to schedule appointments for patients in order of priority.



 Greater Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Lothian are among the NHS boards which will use the system. 

 The Scottish Government said they are on track for all those aged 80 and over to have received their first dose of the vaccine by the end of the first week in February. 

 This age group will not receive a blue envelope as they are being contacted by telephone or another form of letter. 

 Ms Freeman said: ""We all know how easy it is to ignore some of the mail which comes through our letterboxes but these blue envelopes will be very distinctive and they will contain details of your vaccine appointment so please open them. 

 ""The letters are being posted first class and we have been advised by the Royal Mail that the colour will allow them to prioritise delivery.

779,780,https://www.meathchronicle.ie/2021/01/23/paul-hopkins-look-after-your-children-they-are-most-precious/,"My father’s sister Maeve was a mere slip of a young woman when she took the boat to an England where ‘no Irish need apply’ and eventually found a job in the British civil service and a flat in Chiswick. She came home every Christmas to my grandmother’s house and my family would visit on Stephen’s Day.

I liked her. Maeve spoke in a clipped accent and always gave us expensive presents. She never married, had no friends in London that she spoke of, and across the water was known as Mary, the name on her birth cert and also my grandmother’s name.

By then I was married with young children and every other Christmas I would invite Maeve to come stay with us. Her tradition of giving lavish gifts continued, though to look at her you would think she hadn’t a penny to her name. She took no pride in herself, was dowdy and unfashionable.

She seldom interacted with my children, but I do remember her more than once saying to me: “Look after your children, Paul. They are the most precious thing you can have.” Her tone struck me as odd.

The day we buried Maeve, in her 80s, my brother said to me: “I often wonder if that man that day was actually looking for Maeve. She was after all known over there as Mary.”

My brother said matter-of-factly: “Well our mother always maintained that Maeve had gone to London to have a baby and give it up for adoption. A family secret, you might say. Maybe that was her son that day looking for her but of course he asked for Mary and we confused it with our grandmother.”

When I was 16, there was the Gang of Five, four boys and ‘Burns’ who looked like a young Audrey Hepburn. One day Burns said she wanted us to meet a girl she had just met. (I cannot recall the circumstance of their meeting)

Anna was tall and svelt, and as pretty as a picture; shy and unassuming. She was 16 and had been ‘raised’ in the Sacred Heart Home. We never asked her the ‘why or wherefor’ of her circumstance. Such inquiring was not in our thought process back then.

Anna always had to be back at the orphanage by six to “help the nuns with the babies and sort out the washing of the nappies”. I remember when this shy but lovely girl told us this that I noticed how raw her hands were.

To this day, I wonder often what became of her, what kind of life did Anna have. Did she find love? Happiness?s I write, nearly 4,000 children are homeless, 10% of all our children live below the poverty line, many young pupils get their schooling — when they do — in the 1,600 unsuitable prefab buildings throughout the country and the cost of childcare continues to escalate.","Paul Hopkins: ‘Look after your children, they are most precious’",www.meathchronicle.ie

The chancellor is being urged to replace an increase in Universal Credit with a new type of payment.

A centre-right think tank has suggested Rishi Sunak should replace the £20-a-week increase in Universal Credit (UC) with a new ""coronavirus hardship payment""



The suggestion has been made by the Centre for Policy Studies as a way of making it easier to phase out post-pandemic.

The Centre for Policy Studies is regarded as being close to Government thinking.



The Universal Credit increase was brought in at the start of the first lockdown, in March last year.

The payment rise was designed to help struggling families and is due to expire at the end of March.



But Mr Sunak is under intense pressure - including from some Tory MPs - to extend it while lockdown restrictions remain in place.



So far the Chancellor has resisted the calls, insisting he needs to start rebuilding public finances after the massive support the Government has given to nurse the economy through the pandemic.

In a briefing paper, the CPS said it would be ""unreasonable"" to cut support at a time when lockdown restrictions are creating intense financial pressure for many families.



However, replacing it with a clearly defined temporary measure could offer the Government a way out of its political dilemma.

The report's author, James Heywood, said: ""The Government have backed themselves into a corner with the £20 uplift in Universal Credit - it's much harder to take something away once it's in place.

""Replacing the uplift with a clearly defined temporary support mechanism, combined with other reforms, would offer the intended financial support while making it easier to prepare claimants for its eventual withdrawal.""

The report said the hardship payments should run for six months, with a further three-month phasing-out period when they would be cut by half.

At the same time, it called for a more generous one-off uprating of UC, which is currently set to rise by just 0.5% in April.

The CPS said a 2.5% increase, in line with the rate being applied to the state pension, would add an extra £100 a year to the standard allowance for a single claimant over the age of 25.",Sunak urged to replace Universal Credit with new 'hardship payment',www.belfastlive.co.uk

787,788,https://punchng.com/electricity-grid-collapses-27-times-in-three-years/,"The nation’s power grid collapsed 27 times in the last three years, the latest data from the Nigerian Electricity System Operator have shown.

The number of times the national grid suffered a collapse fell to four in 2020 from 10 in 2019 and 13 in 2018, according to the data.

The grid recorded 25 total collapses in the period under review while two were partial.

A total system collapse means total blackout nationwide, while partial system collapse is a failure of a section of the grid, according to NESO.

The grid has continued to suffer system collapse over the years amid lack of spinning reserve that is meant to forestall such occurrences.

Spinning reserve is the generation capacity that is online but unloaded and that can respond within 10 minutes to compensate for generation or transmission outages.

Although five power stations are meant to provide spinning reserves, sometimes none may have actual reserve.

The power stations are Egbin, Delta, Olorunsogo NIPP, Geregu NIPP and Omotosho NIPP.

Total power generation in the country stood at 4,547.70 megawatts as of 6am on Thursday, according to NESO data.

The system operator put the nation’s installed generation capacity at 12,954.40MW; available capacity at 7,652.60MW; transmission wheeling capacity at 7,300MW; and the peak generation ever attained at 5520.4MW.

The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, in its latest quarterly report, noted the improvement in grid stability in the first quarter of 2020.

NERC said to further improve the grid stability and prevent system collapse in subsequent quarters and beyond, it would, in collaboration with the Transmission Company of Nigeria, intensify efforts to ensure further improvement in the grid performance.

It said it would also intensify the monitoring of strict compliance to the system operator’s directives to generators on free governor and frequency control mode in line with the provisions of the subsisting operating codes in the electricity industry.

“Furthermore, the commission has reviewed the outcome of the competitive procurement of spinning reserves conducted by TCN. This is to guarantee adequate spinning reserves for proper management of the grid by the SO,” the report said.

The commission noted that frequency fluctuation and other harmonic distortion would result in poor power quality that could damage sensitive industrial machinery and equipment connected at high voltage levels.

“To minimise the frequency and voltage fluctuations, the commission shall continue to work with TCN and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that system voltage and frequencies operate within the prescribed regulatory limits in order to ensure safe and reliable electricity supply,” it said.

The former minister received the support of 110 out of 164 countries as the most qualified person to lead the international trade body.

Her selection, as the first American and woman of color to serve as the WTO’s director-general will send a clear message of inclusion to the rest of the world,” TheCable quoted the US leaders as saying in the letter.

The letter added, “We know Dr Okonjo-Iweala and have found her to be a woman of integrity, an honest broker and a pragmatist who consistently delivers results. We believe strongly that she can be a transformative director-general, one who — with your support — will be embraced and effective within and beyond the WTO.

789,790,https://www.communitycommon.com/news/7384/city-could-clear-fiscal-watch-status-in-2021,"PORTSMOUTH — Mayor Kevin Johnson says the city’s financial outlook has improved throughout the past few years, but there are still roadblocks in clearing the fiscal watch hurdle.

Perhaps the most significant roadblock remaining City Manager Sam Sutherland says is the sanitation fund, which is at risk of being in a deficit although not currently. Other funds- general, water, sewer, streets, and insurance- were reporting deficits at one time which prompted a state fiscal watch but have since improved.

While the most recent 2019 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report found a General Fund actual balance of $5.9 million, Sutherland says action through form of rate increases is still needed to keep the sanitation fund from going into the red in the future.

“The state put us in a fiscal watch status, and things have to be corrected to get us out of this status,” he said during a Tuesday interview. “I think we’re along the ways towards that, but there’s still some discussion that we have to have with the state.”

“I think they’re small hurdles, but they’re still hurdles that we have get over to get the status actually lifted.”

According to the city website, there are differing rates for sanitation divided into regular and senior monthly billings. These groups both pay an extra $5 for each additional issued tipper can, but seniors pay $15.50 per month instead of the regular rate of $20.50. The division, employing 13 full-time workers, is responsible for the trash removal and pickup from residential and commercial areas in the city.

Still, in draft form, where the City Managers’ Office and the Ohio Auditor’s Office are reviewing the numbers, Sutherland said increases to those rates across the board will likely be needed.

“Whatever that percent increase turns out to be, it will all fall in-line with those three different rates,” he said, where he called the regular $20.50 rate the primary one in focus.

During the City Managers’ session on Jan. 11, Sutherland shared two past ordinances that were seen as a way to correct the city’s sanitation fund deficit at the time.

The first measure, passed in 2013, proposed a gradual increase of rates to get out of the deficit. When then City Manager Derek Allen began analysis the following year, however, it was determined that a different plan would be needed.

“The other ordinance probably would have taken care of it, but it was a long-term thing,” Sutherland said. “That fund was in such a bad situation that it needed to be acted on.”

Allen’s 2014 plan served as the next and faster remedy for the city to correct the situation, he said, were minutes from a July City Managers’ session of that year said the fund started the year in a $40,000 deficit and projected to end 2014 with a $400,000 shortage.

The report reads the change was due to the cost of manpower, health insurance and the increase from $265,000 to $600,000 to haul the trash to the landfill.

“We erased the sanitation rate and they are aware of that and he’s confident we’ve addressed that problem,” the report states, which also details the status of the General, Health Insurance, Enterprise, Wastewater, and Street funds.

Sutherland wanted to revisit the topic as all current Council members, with exception for Mayor Johnson, were not representing their respective wards when these changes were enacted.

790,791,https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/biden-tells-mexicos-president-he-will-end-trumps-draconian-immigration-policies,"President Biden on Friday told Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador that he will reverse the Trump administration’s ""draconian"" immigration policies -- in a week in which the new U.S. president has signed a flurry of immigration orders.

A readout from the White House said that Biden spoke with Lopez Obrador to ""review bilateral cooperation on a range of bilateral and regional issues, particularly regional migration.""

""The President outlined his plan to reduce migration by addressing its root causes, increasing resettlement capacity and lawful alternative immigration pathways, improving processing at the border to adjudicate requests for asylum, and reversing the previous administration’s draconian immigration policies,"" the statement said.

Biden campaigned on ending the Trump administration’s stricter immigration policies and has made it a priority since being inaugurated.

On Wednesday, Biden signed an order halting construction of the wall at the southern border while the administration studies whether it can redivert money that has been assigned to the project.

He also signed a memorandum to protect the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which shields immigrants who came to the country illegally as children from deportation.

Other orders included an end to Trump-era travel bans, another revoking the Trump administration’s plan to exclude non-citizens from the census and the apportionment of congressional seats, and another to extend the Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) designation for Liberians in the country until June 2022.

On Friday, a 100-day deportation freeze went into effect and was immediately subjected to a lawsuit from Texas -- claiming it was dangerous, unconstitutional and in violation of an agreement with DHS.

Biden is also forging forward with a sweeping immigration plan that includes an eight-year path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants, as well as immediate green cards for farmworkers and DACA and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients.

Lopez Obrador has been supportive of such a move, and urged there to be dual nationality for Mexicans who work in the U.S.

Biden has also promised to end the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) -- known as the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy. That Trump-era policy keeps migrants in Mexico as they await their hearings. Biden promised to end the program, but officials during the transition said that it may take longer to achieve.",Biden tells Mexico's president he will end Trump's 'draconian' immigration policies,www.fox32chicago.com

The Group Chief Executive Officer, Dr David Ogogo, said in a statement on Friday that the webinar would expose companies on ways and strategies to remain relevant in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to him, most organisations are finding it difficult to achieve their set objectives due to the pandemic.

“Consequently some organisations had to redefine their vision and mission statements so as to find ways and means of remaining relevant to ensure sustainability,” Ogogo said.

The CEO said the webinar would enlighten organisations on how to remain relevant, viable and well-managed, as well as ways the country could get out of the current recession.

He added that the knowledge from the webinar would enable participants to understand the causes of major corporate failures in history and how to avoid them.

According to Ogogo, the webinar themed, ‘How organisations can achieve principled performance in 2021 and beyond,’ will hold virtually on Febuary 12.

He said the forum would feature carefully selected economists and experts who would share their insights on ways to wither the current economic challenges.

Wheels of Change spokeswoman Bean Gill said it took 23 forms and a five-month wait just to replace a wheelchair cushion. “Why are we still living like it’s 1980? … We want a seat at the table and we will even bring our own seats,” she said. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. 

tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Baffling bureaucracy: Wheelchair advocate says it took 23 forms just to replace a cushion “We need to be seen as people, we need to have a voice.” Wheels of Change says long wait times for specialized wheelchairs are harming Albertans’ physical and mental health. The program at issue, Alberta Aids to Daily Living (AADL), helps people with disabilities and illnesses pay for equipment and supplies. But it’s inefficient and needs to be more patient-centred, said Gill. “It’s frustrating as somebody who needs a wheelchair. It’s not like this is a luxury item,” she said. “This is my legs. My wheelchair is my legs. I cannot move, I cannot go anywhere without my wheelchair. It is a necessity for me to live.”

People with spinal cord injuries use catheters to urinate. Gill says the government’s program only allows for one catheter a day, meaning they must either only urinate once, or wash and reuse it and risk getting a urinary tract infection. Albertans in this program also regularly have to pay out of pocket to rent wheelchairs while they wait for theirs to arrive. Dr. Adalberto Loyola-Sanchez, professor at the University of Alberta’s faculty of medicine, said not having a properly-fitting chair can create shoulder pain and bedsores that can get infected and become serious. It can also lead to depression and anxiety as people with injuries become isolated. “These people are going through a life-changing event, and if you don’t have the appropriate equipment to mobilize and be a part of the community … that has devastating effects on their mental health,” he said. “I don’t understand why we have that double standard. Can you wait without your legs for a day?” Steve Buick, Health Minister Tyler Shandro’s press secretary, said there have been no recent changes to benefits or eligibility for AADL, but it has made more products like catheters accessible to some clients that can demonstrate need. “But wait times for some benefits are too long. We’re committed to improving access to publicly-funded health services and that includes the equipment and supplies provided by AADL,” he said. “Minister Shandro has asked Alberta Health for a plan to improve access; it will cost money but these services matter to people, just like surgery and other health care. The minister is committed to making this program serve people better.”",Baffling bureaucracy: Wheelchair advocate says it took 23 forms just to replace a cushion,www.edmontonsun.com

I was one of those watching and, at that time, the US was a beacon of democracy and the rule of law, the land of the free and the brave and the source of an aspirational dream.

President Donald Trump, through his America First policy, redefined the US' image abroad. But that image has also been altered through his actions and words - not least his reported dismissal of African countries in highly derogatory terms.

And though the office of the president can be separated from the individual, President Biden will, in the light of the last four years, have to address Kenya and the rest of the continent in a markedly different tone and with a markedly different message.

But aside from the failure to release tax returns, undermining intelligence agencies and contradicting scientists in the midst of a pandemic, the events of 6 January, when the president's supporters stormed the US Capitol, showed that this went beyond one man.

In military terms, for many years the US has been described as the world's policeman but when it comes to democratic norms it has also been called the world's prefect. But can opposition movements and civil society groups in countries like Kenya now rely on Washington for support when elections come?

797,798,https://www.wigantoday.net/health/employers-signing-rapid-testing-covid-19-3110635,"The Government is working with NHS Test and Trace to implement testing at businesses operating in sectors such as food, manufacturing, energy and retail and within the public sector including job centres, transport networks, and the military.

An estimated 734,600 lateral flow tests have been distributed across the public and private sector so far, helping workers who need to leave home for work during lockdown to continue to do so, while quickly identifying those who may be carrying the virus.

The Government says rapid testing in the workplace, using lateral flow tests, aims to help protect those at highest risk and provide vital information to help inform further roll-out of the technology in future.

In addition to scaling up employer-led testing, targeted community testing is now being rolled out across all local authorities in England, with town halls being encouraged to target testing to people who are unable to work from home.

Town halls will have to make the decision on how to use the tests, prioritising those who cannot work from home during the national lockdown. The Government has suggested these could include council workers, bin collectors or shop workers.

“Lateral flow tests have already been hugely successful in finding positive cases we would not otherwise find and I encourage employers and workers to take this offer up to help protect essential services and businesses.""

Tests detect cases with high levels of the virus, which the DHSC says makes them effective in finding infectious individuals who aren’t showing any symptoms and are the most likely to transmit the disease.

All NHS patient facing staff in acute, mental health, ambulance and community trusts have been provided with lateral flow tests to enable them to test themselves at home twice a week. Over 25 million tests have been distributed to date.

""I am pleased so many businesses have taken up the opportunity of rapid workplace testing. I would encourage even more to do so and to continue to follow our COVID-secure guidance as we pull together to protect our NHS and save lives.”

798,799,https://www.kuer.org/2021-01-23/mexicos-oscar-winning-three-amigos-embrace-rise-of-fernando-frias-de-la-parra,"Mexican film directors have enjoyed success at the Academy Awards in recent years. Alfonso Cuarón won an Oscar for directing Gravity in 2014, and for Romain 2019.Alejandro González Iñárritu won one in 2015 for directing Birdmanand the following year forThe Revenant.And Guillermo del Toro won his Oscar for directingThe Shape of Water in 2018. Now, the ""Tres Amigos,"" as they're known, may welcome uno más: up-and-coming filmmaker Fernando Frías de la Parra. His film I'm No Longer Here is Mexico's Academy Award entry for Best International Feature Film.

The film, also titled Ya No Estoy Aqui,is set in 2010, during a real, but very brief, cultural phenomenon that happened in Monterrey, Mexico. That's when teens in the industrial city's impoverished barrios would hang out in the streets wearing baggy clothes, singing and dancing to nostalgic cumbia music from Colombia.

""I wanted to go deeper and understand why they were like dancing the way they dance, dressing the way they dress and associating in gangs,"" said Frías, who wrote and directed his fictionalized version of what's known as the ""Kolombia"" subculture. He said he discovered some of the why. ""It's an opportunity to reinvent themselves, knowing that there's not many options in life for them. It's like, you think that just because I'm poor, I am dangerous and I should be a criminal? You think I'm ugly or something? Well, I'm going to embrace your rejection and I'm going to recreate my identity with dignity by creating this style.""

In Frías' story, Ulises is the leader of a crew called Los Terkos, the stubborn ones. He has a DIY punk hairstyle, spiked here, bleached there. ""It almost resembles a pre-Hispanic Aztec warrior,"" noted Frías.

With his friends, Ulises dances like a slow rooster, twirling around with heel-toe, heel-toe footwork, hunched over with his arms up, ""like a big bird spreading the wings and dancing and showing off,"" Frías says. ""It's a unique style.""

After a rival gang threatens him, Ulises escapes from Monterrey. He crosses the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, and ends up in New York City, where he finds work with a construction crew. But he longs to be back in Monterrey, where no one makes fun of his style and he can be himself. Like the lyrics of the cumbia music he loves, Ulises is filled with nostalgia. Frías says Ulises' journey is more about ""the internal conflicts that he's living.""

Juan Daniel Garcia Treviño makes his acting debut as Ulises, having been discovered by Frías and his team at a music festival in Monterrey. They saw him playing percussion on stage, and afterwards, approached him, asking if he'd want to be in the film. At the time, Garcia was a 17-year-old construction worker who never imagined becoming an actor, much less the star of a film that could earn a spot on the Oscar short list, which will be announced on Feb. 9. Garcia and the other non-actors worked together for months to develop the characters and learn the dances.

""Here in Monterrey, the film reflects the real lives of a lot of people,"" Garcia says in Spanish. He says they're proud that Frías represented their culture authentically. The 20-year-old Garcia is now acting in his third film and says he and the others who played Los Terkos are grateful for the opportunity to portray the culture that has since faded away.

Frías says the Kolombia scene was disappearing even as he was researching it. ""It doesn't exist [now] because of the so-called war on drugs by the administration of President Calderón, who sent the army into the streets,"" he says. ""And this new cartel that came in was recruiting the kids, so that killed the life on the streets for several years. The music, though, it will always be part of the Monterrey people.""

The 41-year-old filmmaker grew up in Mexico City, the youngest of three children. His father was a lawyer and his mother worked for Pan American World Airways, allowing the family to travel the world. Frías studied communications and photography as an undergraduate in Mexico City, and made documentaries before going to Columbia University on a Fulbright scholarship. While earning his master's degree, he began writing his screenplay for I'm No Longer Here.

Frías persevered for seven years to make this film, with challenges that included repeatedly trying to secure a visa for Garcia to film in New York. Meanwhile, he made short documentaries for Condé Nast Traveler, and he directed the entire first season of HBO's Los Espookys. ""I liked the playfulness and absurdity of it,"" Frías says of the bilingual comedy series.

The filmmaker still lives in New York, where he's working on new projects. Meanwhile, I'm No Longer Here is streaming on Netflix, earning accolades and praise.

""I think is one of the most memorable debuts on film and Mexican film in the last couple of decades,"" Guillermo del Toro said in a video conversation recorded last year. ""It's a very painful and beautiful movie at the same time. It presents you with the usual melodramatic choices and discards them.""

""Yeah, it challenges all your expectations,"" Alfonso Cuarón agreed.

Del Toro praised Frías for portraying a culture that no longer exists and the experiences of a young man in exile trying to protect his identity. ""I think that is rare,"" he added, ""a movie that you find being done so early in the career of a young filmmaker that has the wisdom and the complete control of the medium. He inherits a mantle that you can trace back to the golden era of Mexican cinema.""

""Fernando for me, is already an inspiration,"" said Cuarón. ""He's truly original.""

Del Toro and Cuarón are rooting for Fernando Frías to join them as Oscar winners.

A total of five cases of the variant have been identified and additional sequencing continues for other possible cases already positive for COVID-19, according to the Jan. 23 news release from the health department.

Officials say brief, public exposures are not normally a COVID-19 exposure concern but the B.1.1.7. variant is more easily transmitted and could lead to more cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

The initial case of the B.1.1.7. variant was identified Jan 16 in the University of Michigan community, according to the release. It is not clear if all subsequent cases are connected to this first case.

“The possibility of additional spread of the variant is a concern,” said Juan Luis Marquez, MD, MPH, medical director with Washtenaw County Health Department.

“At this point and with the guidance of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, we are encouraging extra precautions. Seek testing if you have symptoms, have recently been exposed to COVID-19, or have recently traveled to a place where the new variant is circulating. And everyone should make sure they are using all COVID-19 precautions consistently. This includes face masks, social distancing, hand cleaning, avoiding crowds or gatherings, and following isolation and quarantine guidance.”

While believed to be more contagious, there has been no indication that B.1.1.7 affects the clinical outcomes or disease severity compared to the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS).

The Washtenaw County Health Department, MDHHS and the University of Michigan are working closely to implement additional containment strategies to slow the spread of the variant, the release states.

802,803,https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/its-overwhelming-nurse-lifts-lid-4913075,"A nurse at the Royal United Hospital in Bath has described the number of coronavirus patients that are being admitted to the hospital as ""overwhelming"".

The nurse, who wishes to remain anonymous, said people should remember health care workers are people with families too who ""risk their lives"" by coming into work.

She has spoken about the sadness all staff are experiencing when they lose patients but also about how many they are ""making walk back out"" of the hospital.

The nurse, who has worked at the hospital for a number of years, said the ""togetherness"" of all the staff made facing the pandemic bearable.

She has spoken in response to people saying they don't understand why some non-emergency operations have been postponed and scotched claims that the pandemic is not affecting Bath as seriously as elsewhere.

She said: ""People forget members of staff have their own families, we are people not just numbers too, and we have a certain level of things we can cope with.

""We are risking our lives coming into work and so many people can't grasp what we have been subjected to.""

She said: ""It's quite overwhelming the numbers of coronavirus patients coming in and there isn't any pattern to them, they are young, old, overweight or completely healthy.

""There is no trend age-wise and they are coming in regularly.

""We are seeing more and more people coming in very sick that need a lot of care. A lot are needing oxygen therapy and of course, all of the staff are all in full PPE which has its own bearing on them.""

The nurse, who has herself suffered from Covid, said the hospital had plenty of procedures in place to try and help with the current pressures the hospital is experiencing.

She said she was ""frightened"" of getting coronavirus again as it took her over a month the first time around.

""That was scary but what is scary is that we could get it again. I've just had my vaccine but it won't be effective just yet. It's very frightening to think about getting it again, I was really unwell the first time.

""Lots of staff have had it so at least we can all support each other on that.""

Just last week, the hospital confirmed a record number of coronavirus patients, and that number had risen again to 126 as of Tuesday, with 19 people currently on ventilators.

The hospital also has plans in place to expand its critical care beds should it need to.

The anonymous nurse said: ""We've got two ICU's just for coronavirus but they've made quite a few areas coronavirus-specific and turned more wards to just deal with it.

""We're trying to deal with high volumes of patients coming in via ambulances and making sure they aren't delayed coming in.

""There are plans, as you know, to make more critical care beds should we need them. We just have no control over this one.""

The long-term psychological impacts of working on the front lines of the pandemic are not yet known, but the RUH nurse said many staff members have learned to adapt to the stress and sadness of it.

She said: ""I think everyone's feeling very overwhelmed by the situation. There are constant changes to guidelines to adjust to every week, it's all so changeable but it's all being done for the best reasons so you just adapt.

""There is an element of sadness for us all, we know what this virus can do and have seen it first hand.

""We've lost patients to it, and there's no telling what's going to happen next if more very sick patients are going to come through the door or not.

""There is, of course, alot of stress and without the teamwork of us all, we couldn't do it.

""People have come in on days off to help out, going above and beyond for one another, there's a real sense of togetherness.

""But this is a really tough time for us all.""

The nurse said there is a ""slight dread"" about going into work due to not knowing what she'll be facing.

""There is a slight dread each morning, not because of the hospital or its staff which are both fantastic, but at the situation, you could be walking into, the sick patients. It's also because you don't know if things will have changed since your last shift, like procedures.

""I'm so grateful to all the staff, the domestics too, and even the IT guys, everyone has a part to play in making sure this keeps going.""

Alongside having a small number of military personnel helping out at the RUH, the hospital announced the postponement of some procedures to help relieve pressure.

Some members of the public expressed dismay at the news on social media.

The nurse said: ""It really bothered me when people criticised that, as they don't understand what is going on here at the moment.

""There just isn't the capacity to do those procedures, there aren't any spare beds for it and not enough staff as we have many off sick.

""The staff have been absolutely amazing throughout this, there is no messing about with the guidelines and everyone is doing their absolute best but it's still catchable.""

Through it all, the nurse said she was ""proud"" to be making a difference but that people shouldn't forget the toil on frontline health care works.

'What people forget is that we are making sure more people than not walk out of here'

She said: ""Whilst this is a sad and difficult time, we are all proud knowing we are making a difference. What people forget is that we are making sure more people than not walk out of here.

""As nurses we all have a lot of compassion and like the nurse with Mike Hemming, she didn't have to stay with him but she did.""

Mike Hemming was a recent patient at the RUH who has spoken of the moment he was told he was in ""throes of end of life care"" after catching coronavirus and then developing blood clots and pneumonia.

He spoke about the moment a young nurse cries and comforts him after being given the news.

The RUH nurse said: ""We're like that, we know that to a dying or seriously ill patient, what a difference small acts of kindness mean.

""We're constantly asking each other if we are okay, trying to make sure everyone is coping okay at the moment and everyone knows where to seek help if they need it.

""This is a really serious situation, and people should think about how it would affect them if one of their loved ones was in here.

""People forget members of staff have their own families, we are people not just numbers too, and we have a certain level of things we can cope with.

""We are risking our lives coming into work and so many people can't grasp what we have been subjected to. I read that 650 NHS staff have died fighting this, that really hit me.

""I know people ask about nightingale hospitals but there just isnt the staff. Don't forget the staff matter, without us there is nothing.

""We can't just magic new wards and beds out of anywhere. People just don't see behind the doors and they make up this conspiracy rubbish but we're here dealing with it every day.""

The nurse explained that on top of the pressures caused by the coronavirus pandemic, normal seasonal pressures caused by flu and other illness are compounding the problem, seeing some people come in much sicker than if they had not delayed help.

She said: ""I think people forget that as well as having coronavirus patients, we have our normal patients who are also very sick and need us too.

""We've had to stop visiting times for them and it's sad for their families they can't come in too.

804,805,https://today.rtl.lu/news/business-and-tech/a/1649527.html,"Malaysia has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization over European Union rules affecting the consumption of palm oil-based biofuels, according to a document published Tuesday.

In the complaint, dated January 15, Malaysia charges that the EU, and in particular its member states France and Lithuania, had imposed restrictive measures on the use of palm oil that violate international trade agreements.

Malaysia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil, balked at EU efforts to phase out the use of palm oil as a biofuel, and has requested consultations to help resolve the dispute.

The EU has embarked on an major plan committing member states to build a carbon neutral economy by 2050, including by promoting the use of biofuels.

But it has deemed that palm oil production is not sustainable, and palm oil-based biofuels cannot be counted towards EU renewable targets.

By doing so, the bloc and its member states ""confer unfair benefits to EU domestic producers of certain biofuel feedstocks, such as rapeseed oil and soy, and the biofuels produced therefrom, at the expense of palm oil and oil palm crop-based biofuels from Malaysia,"" according to the complaint.

Palm oil is a key ingredient in a wide range of products from food to cosmetics but it has long been controversial.

Environmentalists say it drives deforestation, with huge swathes of rainforest logged in recent decades to make way for plantations.

Its use in food and cosmetics has already dropped in Europe, partly due to pressure from green groups on major corporations, but has been increasing in biofuels.

Malaysia is the second country to take the EU to task over palm oil use restrictions, after the world's largest producer of the oil filed a complaint in December 2019.

Malaysia's complaint marks the 600th trade dispute brought before the WTO since the organisation was created in 1995.

The request for consultations marks the first step in the WTO dispute system, and is aimed at giving the parties a chance to talk things through and resolve their differences without moving forward with litigation.

If the consultations fail to resolve the dispute within 60 days, the WTO can create a panel of experts to review the case.",World Trade Organisation: Malaysia files WTO complaint over EU palm oil restrictions,today.rtl.lu

EU lawmakers voted 592 to 32 with 58 abstentions on Thursday in favour of a resolution calling for a tougher stance against the Vietnamese government and highlighting the link between human rights and the trade deal the bloc has with Vietnam.

In a media release, the European Parliament said lawmakers were “appalled by and condemn the intensifying crackdown on dissent and the increasing violations of human rights in Vietnam”.

“Respect for human rights constitutes a key foundation of the bilateral relations between Vietnam and the EU and is an essential element of the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement, ” it said.

Vietnam’s foreign ministry said that the European parliament resolution was not objective and that no one in Vietnam had been arrested in violation of their human rights or right to free speech under the constitution.

The push for a new deal came in a broad-ranging call between the two leaders that touched on the global response to the coronavirus pandemic as well as the Biden administration announcing this week that the U.S. would rejoin the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization, according to a statement from Downing Street.

A new trade agreement between the allies is a higher priority for Johnson than it is for Biden. The U.K. regained control over its national trade policy at the start of the month following the end of a post-Brexit transition period.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that the administration had no timeline for forging a new trade deal as Biden's attention is largely focused on getting the coronavirus pandemic under control and pressing Congress to pass the president's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.

Janet Yellen, Biden's Treasury secretary nominee, also signaled during her confirmation hearing earlier this week that Biden wasn't eager to negotiate new trade deals.

“President Biden has been clear that he will not sign any new free trade agreements before the U.S. makes major investments in American workers and our infrastructure,"" Yellen said.

Downing Street said Saturday that Biden and Johnson discussed “the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries,"" and Johnson “reiterated his intention to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible.""

The White House in its own statement said that the two leaders spoke about combating climate change, containing COVID-19, and ensuring global health security as well as shared foreign policy priorities in China, Iran and Russia. But the statement notably made no mention of discussion on trade.

The call with Johnson was at least Biden's third call with a foreign counterpart since Friday.

His image appears superimposed on a computer screen, looking as though he’s watching a game unfold from his red and black throne-like chair in the corner. Boyce is playing Stellaris, a video game of space exploration and empire management, with a small, remote group of friends while a few hundred people look on. Using the handle Troyd_Destin, Boyce is not only broadcasting the game live, which he does a few times a week, but he’s monitoring the chat box where viewers are interacting with him. This is just one of many things happening on Twitch, the online platform where people can stream themselves and watch others playing games, cooking, performing live music and more. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Edmonton games and cooking and music, live ... on Twitch “What I wanted to do was engage with people that also like the same type of games that I played and interact with them,” said Boyce, who focuses on strategy games on his Twitch channel.

Boyce is part of a growing number of Edmontonians streaming on Twitch. Most streamers talk about the community who joins along, viewers who participate in a text chat while watching the action. It’s a hobby, though a small few have turned it into a full-time job. Twitch.tv launched in 2011, focused on people broadcasting themselves playing video games. It became so popular that in 2015 Amazon bought the streaming platform for nearly a billion dollars. Yes, that’s billion with a ‘B.’ Rebecca Deveau says there’s easily more than 500 streamers in Edmonton, though the number is difficult to pin down because of the nature of Twitch. Deveau, who streams under the name MostlyBex, is the Edmonton Community MeetUp community manager on Twitch. While not a Twitch staff member, she organizes events and activities for streamers and content creators in Edmonton. Deveau started streaming four years ago, broadcasting from her PlayStation 4 without a headset. She slowly upgraded her equipment while playing video games on her stream. A year and a half ago she moved her PC into her kitchen and started cooking in front of a live audience. “Edmonton is very well known in the Twitch sphere for being innovative,” Deveau said. “I remember when you couldn’t even stream on Twitch when it wasn’t games.” She isn’t the only Edmontonian breaking new ground on the streaming platform. Justin Cauti and Mike Campbell decided to take their weekend board game group online in 2015. Their channel, PlayingBoardGames, was one of the first board gaming groups on Twitch. Rather than broadcast themselves playing a video game, they gather around a board game with a camera fixed on the action.

“To me, there’s nothing better than sitting around and playing board games,” Cauti said. “I have always been around making content on the internet. When we started there were only two or three board game streamers on Twitch. Now there’s a lot more.” “At the time, we were sending emails to Twitch saying there should be a table top category on Twitch,” Campbell said. Campbell and Cauti, along with a cast of supporting friends, reach a few hundred people every week, showing off the latest board games and favourite classics. Cauti is a freelance filmmaker and Campbell is an audio visual technician, skills that help them understand what equipment to use and how to make their stream look good for their audience. They credit their success, in part, to the rise in popularity of board games but also their commitment to consistency — streaming every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday without fail. This regularity means their audience knows when to expect them online. Cauti says they’ve missed fewer than a dozen scheduled dates since they started. This schedule was compromised by pandemic health restrictions, which made gathering for board games almost impossible, so their content has had to change and adapt to the times. While they’re not playing physical board games together at the moment, the cast of PlayingBoardGames streams Dungeons and Dragons sessions over video chat and plays digital versions of board games. Board games are a small jump from the video games traditionally hosted on Twitch, but there is an increasingly eclectic menagerie of content available. The Washington Post streamed political analysis during the first Trump impeachment and the Internet Movie Database streams film podcasts and analysis. Musicians have also moved to Twitch to broadcast live performances, and the platform is helping their music reach a wider, global audience.

Joses Martin, a local DJ and general manager of The Grindstone Comedy Theatre, and also the founder of SWEAT — a collective of local DJs and regular dance party event — was organizing his birthday party last March when health restrictions cancelled the plans. He decided to move his birthday celebration online, broadcasting for friends on Zoom, but soon discovered Twitch and now hosts the weekly SWEAT sets on the platform. “When we could gather, that creative outlet (SWEAT) was definitely put into the weekend party, having a good time with some people and playing some music,” Martin said. “Once we couldn’t do that, I — for one — needed to maintain that outlet for myself.” The SWEAT shows started in 2014 and have been going strong in various bars and clubs since then. Their goal, as outlined on their website, is a “totally inclusive electronic music dance party focused on 100 per cent positive vibes.” These days, Martin performs to an empty room at The Grindstone every Saturday night, dancing along to his music in front of a camera. While keeping the dance community entertained on Twitch, Martin is still getting new music out online, dropping his Watch Me EP earlier in January. For a few streamers, they’ve turned their passion into a full-time job. Michael Tash, who streams as MTashed, spends his days as a content creator, streaming on Twitch and making videos for YouTube. Tash started making video game content in 2015, and was then asked to stream for another content creator. By 2017, he’d grown his viewership to the point he could support himself financially with this work.

“In university, we had a project about making a business plan,” said Tash, who studied marketing at MacEwan University. “I did a business plan about what I would need to do to grow this channel. I need a logo, I need to be consistent. That summer, I just followed the business plan and it really took off.” He’s learned to follow trends and keep an eye on popular games his audience might enjoy. Last year, he saw Genshin Impact was gathering a lot of interest. He started streaming the game and building content around it. October of last year was one of his busiest months with the number of content viewers reaching nearly 10,000. His average is about 2,000 viewers at a time. “When there are new games out, streaming can be 15 hour days. In some cases I stream seven to eight hours in a day and then I make two videos,” Tash said. “That’s a two-to-three week period, then it slows down for most games.” Tash works a minimum of 60 hours per week. Forty per cent of his time is streaming, another 40 is video creation and editing, and the remainder is spent on the business side. One of his biggest current sponsors is Taco Bell, and he’s worked with a number of tech brands. Tash makes money in a number of ways. Sponsorships bring in revenue, but he also makes money directly from Twitch. While viewers can make donations, they can also subscribe to his channel, allowing them to bypass advertisements and get access to special icons used in the chat. A portion of that subscription payment goes to Tash, while the rest goes to the platform. He also makes money from the ads viewers see on his channel and YouTube. Between all of his revenue streams, Tash makes more than some doctors and lawyers. Tash’s experience is definitely not the norm on Twitch or in content creation. An estimated 90 per cent to 95 per cent of Twitch streamers are broadcasting to between less than 10 people. It’s a passion project Tash has been lucky enough to spin into a full-time job, but for most people, it’s a way to interact with friends and family while having fun, and a chance to meet new people while bonding over a shared hobby.","Edmonton games and cooking and music, live ... on Twitch",www.edmontonsun.com
808,809,https://www.keranews.org/news/2021-01-23/lawyer-for-doctor-accused-of-stealing-covid-19-vaccine-doses-says-they-would-have-gone-to-waste,"The lawyer for a former Harris County Public Health doctor accused of stealing a vial of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for friends and family said on Friday that the man was trying to administer doses before they expired.

Dr. Hasan Gokal was fired earlier this month for allegedly swiping the vial while working at a HCPH vaccination site at Lindsay/Lyons Park in Humble on Dec. 29, according to the Harris County District Attorney’s Office.

In a charging document, prosecutors alleged Gokal took the vial off site and used it to administer doses to friends and family, including his wife. He was charged with theft by a public servant, a Class A misdemeanor that carries a penalty of up to one year in jail and a $4,000 fine.

But during a virtual news conference on Friday, Gokal’s lawyer Paul Doyle said the doctor was following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by trying to use doses that would have otherwise gone to waste, and that he was not giving preferential treatment to anyone.

""Rather than throw it away, he did everything possible,” Doyle said. “He went above and beyond as a public servant.”

According to Doyle, traffic at the Humble site had begun to dwindle when one last patient showed up. In order to administer a dose, doctors had to puncture a new vial of the vaccine, which starts a six-hour shelf life, according to the lawyer.

Afraid the leftover doses would surpass that shelf life, Gokal began to search for people who met the criteria for vaccination under the state’s Phase 1 plan, his lawyer said.

Not knowing what to do, the doctor reached out to friends and neighbors who referred him to others who qualified, Doyle said. He administered the vaccine to at least eight of those people after hours — most of whom were acquaintances — and with 15 minutes remaining before the vaccine was set to hit its shelf life he used one last dose on his wife, who had pulmonary sarcoidosis, the lawyer said.

The patients were then entered into a state database on Dec. 30, Doyle said.

Gokal’s father, who also qualified under state guidelines, was not one of those vaccinated, which Doyle pointed to as evidence that the doctor was not giving preferential treatment to people close to him.

“If he was trying to take care of his family and friends, and that was his M.O., his father certainly would have been vaccinated,” Doyle said.

Gokal was later fired. After reaching out to a local law firm about filing a wrongful termination suit, he was notified of the charges. The doctor later turned himself in, though Doyle said he was never contacted during the investigation.

""If these doctors are going to get criminally prosecuted for trying to use leftover vaccines, there's gonna be more and more waste than there already is,” the lawyer said. “This was not well thought out.”

But the charging document disputes the lawyer’s version of events.

According to a sworn affidavit from HCPH Director Michael McClendon, Gokal was told that there were existing protocols in place to make sure the vaccine wouldn’t be wasted. Under those protocols, leftover doses are supposed to be administered to at-risk front-line workers including health care workers, firefighters and police officers. After that, there’s a secondary waiting list to make sure the doses do not go to waste, according to McClendon.

On Jan. 6, Gokal revealed the details of his plan to another HCPH employee, who told the director immediately, according to the affidavit.

The employee’s fear, according to court documents, was that the department could lose funding over Gokal’s actions.

Harris County Public Health directed questions to the DA’s office. In a statement, Harris County DA Kim Ogg said Gokal disregarded protocols that were already in place to make sure vulnerable populations and front-line workers received any leftover doses of the vaccine.

“He abused his position to place his friends and family in line in front of people who had gone through the lawful process to be there,” Ogg said. “What he did was illegal and he'll be held accountable under the law.”",Lawyer For Doctor Accused Of Stealing COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Says They Would Have Gone To Waste,www.keranews.org
809,810,https://bearingarms.com/cam-e/2021/01/23/gun-control-bills-wa-next-week/,"With Democrats in complete control of the legislature, Washington is one of the most likely states to really target the Second Amendment this legislative session, and lawmakers are going to get their first chance next week when the Senate Law and Justice Committee hears two awful bills that restrict the right to carry and ban the most commonly-sold ammunition magazines in the United States.

The National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action recently alerted members to the dangers contained in the proposals.

On Monday, January 25, the committee will consider Senate Bill 5078, a measure that will ban the manufacture, possession, sale, transfer, etc. of magazines that “are capable of holding” or hold more than ten rounds of ammunition. This includes conversion kits or parts from which any such magazine may be assembled. These so called “high capacity” magazines are in fact standard equipment for commonly-owned firearms that many Americans legally and effectively use for an entire range of legitimate purposes, such as self-defense or competition. Those who own non-compliant magazines prior to the ban are only allowed to possess them on their own property and in other limited instances such as at licensed shooting ranges or while hunting. Prohibited magazines have to be transported unloaded and locked separately from firearms and stored at home locked, making them unavailable for self-defense. Any violation of this measure is a gross misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 364 days in jail and/or a fine of up to $5,000.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers the state of Washington, is currently considering a legal challenge to California’s ban on “high capacity” magazines. A three judge panel of Ninth Circuit declared the state’s ban unconstitutional, but an en banc review of the decision has not yet taken place, leaving most of the law intact for now. Still, the fact that Democrats in Washington are attempting to pass legislation knowing full well that it’s likely to be declared unconstitutional down the road tells me that they’re going to press as hard as they can until the courts tell them to stop.

On Tuesday, January 26, Senate Bill 5038 will be considered by the Senate Law and Justice Committee. As drafted, the bill makes it a crime to openly carry, on the person or in a vehicle, a firearm or other “weapon” if the person is participating in or attending a “demonstration” in a public place. “Demonstration” is loosely defined to mean any behavior by at least one person expressing views or airing grievances which is intended to or attracts an unspecified number of onlookers (a “crowd”). The bill also prohibits openly carrying a firearm or other weapon within 1,000 feet of a demonstration in a public place after a law enforcement officer advises the person to leave. The intent of the bill is called into question because a single person expressing their views on the sidewalk could be considered a “demonstration” under SB 5038. Senate Bill 5038 potentially causes those who are engaging in otherwise lawful activities to become criminals because of the actions of others.

As the NRA alert points out, this legislation is problematic from a couple of different perspectives. For starters, I have issues with any legislation that demands I forfeit my Second Amendment rights while I’m exercising my First Amendment right to speak my mind, but the fact that a “demonstration” can be defined down to a single person makes this law ripe for even more abuse.

If you’re a gun owner in Washington State, please contact your state Senators and urge them to reject SB 5078 and SB 5038. These bills won’t make anyone safer, but they’ll make everyone less free.",Gun Control Bills To Be Heard In Washington State Next Week,bearingarms.com

The 21-year-old, daughter of Minnesota State Supreme Court Justice Margaret Chutich and Allina Health CEO Dr. Penny Wheeler, was found unresponsive in a parking lot outside a sorority house and subsequently pronounced dead at the scene.

As the investigation into her death gets underway, tributes are flooding social media. An Instagram post from her sorority sisters at Delta Delta Delta says the chapter is ""heartbroken"" over Chutich's death, with several members sharing memories about her in the comments:

""We know the days and weeks ahead will be difficult, but we will always remember Olivia’s contagious laugh, bubbly personality and positive outlook on life,"" the post says. ""She lit up every room she walked into and made an impact on every single person she met. We are grateful to have been a part of her beautiful life and to have shared a special bond of friendship with her.""

Rep. Dean Phillips, who represents Minnesota's 3rd Congressional District, tweeted the following in response to the news:

According to the Ames Tribune, police say Chutich was ""last seen late the night before and believe she had been lying in the parking lot for several hours before she was found,"" though they do not suspect foul play.

The paper says Chutich was a junior in communications studies.

Her parents issued the following statement following her death Friday:

The exchange began on Thursday when the Texas Republican responded to a tweet from MGM Studios asking the first film people had seen in theaters. “‘Fantasia,'” Cruz said. “It was playing at a film revival. It scared me; I cried–I was 4. My Mom had to take me out. Good times.”

On Friday, Rogen shot back: “Everyone who made that film would hate you.” (The star of “Superbad” and “Neighbors” also tweeted other criticism of Cruz, whom he called “a white supremacist fascist” and “a clown.”

Cruz ignored the insults, but did respond to the criticism about the creators of “Fantasia.” “They’re all dead. So I think we’re good. And Walt Disney was a Republican,” he replied on Saturday. “Even though you behave online like a Marxist with Tourette’s (screaming “F U! F U!” is really, really clever), your movies are typically pretty funny. I’m sure you hate that I enjoy them.”

815,816,https://punchng.com/restructuring-pdp-pro-buhari-group-clash-over-alleged-campaign-fraud/,"The Peoples Democratic Party has challenged leaders of the All Progressives Congress to speak up over allegations by one of them that the party merely used restructuring as a slogan to woo voters.

National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said this on Saturday in a statement titled, “Restructuring: PDP tasks APC leaders to speak out…says APC must exit with Buhari in 2023.”

The opposition party said it behooves the party and its leaders at various levels to speak out on the decision of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to go back on their party’s campaign promise of implementing an administrative restructuring for the better governance of the country.

Ologbondiyan said, “Our party also tasks APC leaders to respond to their members in the Senate who, through their spokesperson, Senator Ajibola Basiru, have declared that restructuring, as promised by APC, is only a ‘slogan’, as well as the revelation that neither the APC nor its leaders had submitted any memorandum for the promised restructuring and devolution of power upon which they rode to power in 2015.

“Our party holds that the inaction of the APC in the face of the dismissive declaration by the Buhari Presidency that Nigerians, who they had promised restructuring, should now channel their demands to the National Assembly, only goes to further validate the assertions among Nigerians that the APC is a deceptive power-grabbing platform, which is not interested in governance or fulfilling its promises to Nigerians.

‘’It is very disappointing that almost six years after riding to power on the promise of restructuring, the Buhari Presidency has made no concrete effort towards forwarding an executive bill to the National Assembly on the matter, only to now ask Nigerians to carry their burden to the legislative houses.

‘’Our party asserts that beside President Buhari, other bigger culprits of the failure on restructuring are the silent leaders of the APC who, despite promising restructuring, are clandestinely supportive of its huge betrayal.”

The PDP noted that attempts by the APC leadership to extricate itself and the party from the alleged failures of the Buhari regime was bound to fail because Nigerians have seen through their plot.

Ologbondiyan added, “We are already aware of plots by certain APC leaders to recourse to condemning President Buhari as being singularly responsible for the failures of his administration and use such a narrative to beguile Nigerians again with another round of fake promises on restructuring.

“In any case, the APC cannot beguile Nigerians again with their planned disowning of President Buhari in 2023 as the people are already aware of its plots.

“President Buhari, the APC and its leaders must collectively take responsibility for the failures of their administration and allow our nation her desired new lease of life by exiting our political firmament come 2023.”

Attempts to get an official response from the APC were futile as of the time of filing this report.

However, the Chairman of the Buhari Media Organisation Niyi Akinsiju dismissed the PDP statement describing it as “another failed attempt to diminish the giant strides of the Buhari-led APC Federal Government.”

He said, “President Muhammadu Buhari has taken more steps than any administration before him to restructure this country.

“It is under this administration that you saw a genuine commitment to grant local governments and the judiciary financial autonomy.

“Executive Order 10 signed by the President which PDP governors are up in arms against is one of the initiatives aimed at addressing some of the bottlenecks that have kept our nation down.

“Nigerians would never wish to return to the years of the locust which the PDP years represented.”

816,817,https://punchng.com/nigerias-medicinal-plant-bryophyllum-pinnatum-abamoda/,"Bryophyllum pinnatum is a fleshy herb growing up 120cm in the family crassulaceae.The leaves are simple or trifoliolate with petioles. They are green with purple serrated margins which are capable of producing new plants vegetatively when it falls to the ground. The flowers are dropping in lax panicles with an inflated tubular calyx. It is native to Madagascar. It is a valuable medicinal as well as ornamental plant. It is called Abamoda in Yoruba. It is popularly called miracle leaf, life plant and never die.

Before I proceed, I will like to share a research I stumbled on. I will try to simplify it. This study by Robert Kelechi Obi et al was designed to investigate the antiviral potential of Bryophyllum pinnatum and Viscum album. Fresh leaves of these plants were collected and dried. Extraction was done with methanol. Measles (MV), polio PV and yellow fever (YFV) viruses were isolated from their respective vaccines, while herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) was isolated from a positive HSV-1 male case. Results of the antiviral analysis showed that two of the viruses were susceptible to B. pinnatum (L.) and V. album (L.). While HSV-1 was sensitive to B. pinnatum (L.), MV was susceptible to V. album. The PV and YFV were resistant to both plants extracts at the same concentrations.

The conclusion of the study reads “this study has shown that the solution to the worldwide menace of MV and HSV-1 viral diseases could be found in the forest zones of Nigeria.” Despite tremendous progress in human medicine, no drugs exist for the complete treatment of viral diseases but here we are seeing that our own abamoda is a solution to measles and herpes viruses! This should be a pointer to the fact that the cure for COVID 19 pandemic might be in the wild!

While preparing for this, I visited an elderly woman in the neighbourhood. I saw the plant in her house, plucked a leaf, washed and chewed. The head of Herbarium, Pharmacognosy Department at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Mr Ife Ogunlowo, shared some experiences about the plant with me. A child cried all through the night, the child could not be taken to the hospital because of the distance. A steamed leaf of the plant was placed on the forehead of the child and in a few minutes, the child slept off. He also told me he used the plant to resolve the headache problem of one of his students.

I spoke with another person. Her name is Evangelist Calista Oke. She also confirmed to me that the plant is used on baby’s navels.

The plant is popular in folklore medicine. It has been used for the treatment of a variety of conditions such as rheumatism, cough, asthma, tonsillitis, diarrhoea, body pain, arthritis, heartburn, skin ulcers, peptic ulcer, diabetes mellitus and microbial infections. It is applied to wounds, boils and insect bites. In Nigeria, the plant is particularly known for its effective wound healing properties and detachment of the umbilicus of infants. Cough medicine is made from the roots in Sierra Leone. Heated leaves are used for swellings and abscesses in Jamaica. It is used for rheumatoid arthritis, bruises, burns and ulcers in China. In the KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, the leaves are used in combination with Opuntia stricta and Euphorbia hypericifolia to treat gonorrhea.

Pharmacological studies on it reported several biological activities, some of which could authenticate the plant’s traditional uses including immunomodulatory, CNS depressant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-tumour, anti-ulcer, insecticidal, anti-diabetic, anti-convulsant, antioxidant and anti-hypertensive properties. Studies have also reported a wide range of active phytochemicals such as alkaloids, triterpenes, glycosides flavonoids,steroids, bufadienolides, lipids and organic acids. These compounds have been considered to be responsible for the plant’s diverse pharmacological activities.

In many cases, B. pinnatum leaves were soaked in cold water overnight, boiled in water, squeezed or roasted and the extracts obtained to treat ailments. It is also consumed as tea and blended into juices or eaten raw. The plant is a blood purifier and it is a famous medicine to cure kidney stones. The root is used to treat high blood pressure and also to prevent any kind of cardiac problem. The leaf is used for the treatment of fever. The extract of the plant is used for the treatment of roundworms. Using the juice of this plant as ear drop heals ear pain. The root is believed to protect the liver and has proven to be useful for the treatment of hepatitis. It is a diuretic. Because of its antioxidant property, the plant is used in the mixture of herbal green tea. It is used as a home remedy for piles (Haemorrhoids).The leaf juice is used for the treatment of stomach ache. Extract of the plant is used for the nourishment of the hair and for treating gray hair. The leaves are used for intestinal disorders. The paste is used for leucorrhoea. Fresh juice of this plant can be used to treat jaundice.

Because it is used traditionally in ethnomedicinal practices for the treatment of kidney stone and urinary insufficiency, this claim was put to test in a study titled, “Bryophyllum pinnatum Leaf Extracts Prevent Formation of Renal Calculi in Lithiatic Rats by Mahendra Yadav et al.” The conclusion is that Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves showed preventive effect against renal calculi formation and validates its ethnomedicinal use in urinary disorders. It further supports its therapeutic potential for the treatment of urinary calculi (Renal or urinary calculi also called urolithiasis is a condition which involves the process of formation and retention of stone(s) in kidney, bladder and/or urethra that results in renal colic, urine retention and pain in the abdomen and flank).In another study titled. “Antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of kaempferol rhamnoside derivatives from Bryophyllum pinnatum” by Simplice Joel Ndendoung Tatsimo et al, the conclusion is that findings in the study demonstrate that Bryophyllum pinnatum and some of its isolated compounds have interesting antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and therefore confirming the traditional use of B. pinnatum in the treatment of infectious and free radical damages.

Like I always say, the use of plants must not be abused. This plant must be used in moderation. It becomes clearer every day that nature harbours a wealth of invaluable resources for humanity. We have merely scratched the tip of the iceberg.

817,818,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-9180261/Brooklyn-Beckham-showcases-FIFTH-tattoo-tribute-fianc-e-Nicola-Peltz.html,"Brooklyn Beckham has showed off another tattoo tribute to his beloved fiancée Nicola Peltz.

The aspiring photographer, 21, took to Instagram on Saturday to showcase an inking on the back of his neck of a love letter written by his 'future wifey'.

Brooklyn's latest tattoo is now the fifth permanent tribute he has made to the American actress, 26, whom he became engaged to in July last year.

The striking black and white snap shows the son of David and Victoria Beckham facing away from the camera, with the intimate words from Nicola written across his neck and upper back.

The tattoo read: 'My forever boy. Read this anytime you feel anxious. I want you to know how deeply loved you are.

'You have the kindest heart I've ever met and hope I never go a day without your love.

'I think you are so incredible. Just we can get through it all together if you breathe slow and trust. I love you beyond.

And while some of his followers were loving his testament of love, others were concerned about the long-lasting tribute should the happy couple split in the future.

Brooklyn is well known for his love of inkings and has over 30 tattoos across his body.

His latest tattoo comes just days after he unveiled yet another tribute to his fiancée, with the design revealed in a post added to Nicola's Instagram account on Thursday.

In large script inked onto his lower right arm, it reads: 'My life, my love, my truth, my breath, my reason, my beauty, my precious.'

Captioning the image of Brooklyn's arm affectionately resting on her leg, she wrote: 'Forever my person.'

Brooklyn's tattoo comes after he had the name of Nicole's late grandmother Gina tattooed on his arm.

Sharing a picture of the inking, fresh from the tattoo parlour, Nicola, 26, wrote: 'Best birthday gift', clearly touched by the gesture of love.

Other dedications from Brooklyn include Nicola's name, tattooed on his neck, and a pair of eyes and lashes that appear to be the double of hers.

The aspiring photographer has got almost 30 tattoos, including one on his chest which reads; 'mama's boy', as well as a cupid, a rose and a camera.

Nicola was left devastated when her grandmother died in January, just before her birthday.

She paid tribute to Gina on social media in October, writing: 'Happy birthday to my angel in heaven. I can’t even put into words how much I miss you being on earth.

'I wish so badly you could come back to visit me and see me get married. I think about you everyday. I love you with all of my heart, my Gina.'

Nicola also shared a gallery of pictures, including one of Gina's hands clutching a rose, and another one off her holding Nicola's hands.

Meanwhile, Nicola recently appeared to compare her relationship with fiancé Brooklyn to that of her billionaire parents, Claudi and Nelson.

The actress seemed in a reflective mood, as she reposted a picture of herself and the photographer alongside one of her mother and father.

(KABC) -- An explosion and vandalism early Saturday morning at a church in El Monte have prompted an investigation by the FBI and local authorities, officials said.The incident was reported by multiple 911 callers shortly after 1 a.m. at the First Works Baptist church at 2600 Tyler Avenue, according to police. Officers and firefighters arrived at the scene to find smoke emanating from the building but no active fire, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.""It appeared that the walls to the church had been vandalized as well as all the windows,"" El Monte police Lt.

819,820,https://www.modernghana.com/news/1057094/patients-battle-covid-enemy-in-nigeria-second.html,"""Attention, isolation zone,"" warns a bright orange notice at the entrance to the main coronavirus treatment centre in Lagos, Africa's most populous city.

Huge black gates separate the centre at the Yaba Mainland Hospital, which takes 20 seriously ill patients every day, from the hustle and bustle of the city, Nigeria's economic capital.

The gates are not just an entrance, they symbolise the gulf between the sick and those still untouched by the second wave of this devastating pandemic.

On one side, hundreds of people crowd into the markets, many apparently oblivious to the virus' dangers, without masks and failing to observe social distancing.

Inside, the atmosphere could not be more different. Around 100 gravely ill patients struggle to breathe, bedridden and reliant on oxygen tanks.

""I would never believe that Covid-19 (could) happen to me,"" says Idoja Isaac, 57, a former Nigerian Navy officer who was admitted a day earlier with a fever and breathing difficulties.

""Covid 19 is real, it's an enemy you cannot fight with (a) bullet,"" he adds.

When he first experienced symptoms a few days previously, Isaac thought he was suffering from another bout of malaria, never imagining that he too could be struck down by the virus that has afflicted millions worldwide.

Nigeria, with nearly 200 million people, has registered more than 116,000 cases including 1,485 deaths.

Around half of these cases have been in Lagos, which registered the first infection in sub-Saharan Africa in March.

The figures, however, are believed to be underestimates while the number of tests carried out remains far lower than in Europe.

Despite the pandemic, many Nigerians continue to attribute Covid symptoms to malaria and therefore don't seek testing.

The potential for Covid to be missed due to it being mistaken for malaria prompted the governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to issue a warning this week.

""In this second wave of coronavirus, any malaria symptom needs to be considered as Covid-19,"" he said on Tuesday.

Nigeria's second wave, which began in November, reached its peak of infections two weeks ago, and has since appeared to stabilise, according to health authorities.

In the Covid-19 centre, around half the beds are empty.

And in the small intensive care unit, two out of the five available beds are filled by intubated patients, compared with four a few weeks ago.

Likewise, the number of oxygen tanks needed to treat patients has gone from 70 a day a few weeks ago to 500 a day at the peak before coming back down to 350 a day today, said Lagos Health Commissioner Akin Abayomi.

""We have never not had enough oxygen. We've been close to not having enough and we've been stretched, but we've never been in a situation when we had patients who needed oxygen, and there's no oxygen,"" he said.

The centre has just inaugurated its own small oxygen plant which produces 60 cylinders per day, the rest being supplied by the private sector.

But oxygen could run out if infections start to rise again, a possibility the authorities cannot rule out -- especially with a new variant of the virus recently discovered in the country.

At the same time there is concern about the ability of exhausted medical staff to cope with future demands on them.

""Some of us here, we don't even sleep at night, because we have calls, we have to go and attend to patients,"" said doctor Adejumo Olusola.

""Some of us don't leave, we stay in the hospital, two, three days, some five days,""

Like many Nigerians, medical staff are praying that there is no new peak before the end of February when the country is expected to receive its first doses of the vaccine.",Patients battle covid 'enemy' in Nigeria second wave,www.modernghana.com
820,821,https://www.zimbabwesituation.com/news/zimbabwes-2021-economic-prospects-not-promising-biti/,"The MDC Alliance vice president said there was still a lack of confidence in the economy from citizens and this was negatively impacting the economy.

“The regime is failing to address the fundamental structural issues that need to be addressed. To me an economy is 60% confidence, an economy is a social contract, an agreement between those that are governed and those governing. So issues around trust and legitimacy are important, issues around cohesiveness are important…

“I don’t see a common vision in Zimbabwe, I see the dominance of mistrust, the destruction of unifying values within the common State. The existence for example of violence in our streets particularly violence perpetrated against those with an alternative opinion has an economic impact. The arrest of people like Fadzayi Mahere, Hopewell Chin’ono and Job Sikhala has an economic impact. It substrates, corrodes, devalues the social fabric of that Nation-State, said Biti.

Another challenge identified by Biti was the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic while also lamenting the failure of the 2021 budget to specifically set aside funds towards responding to the pandemic.

“We don’t have a policy on vaccines, the 2021Budget did not even make a provision of a single cent on vaccines. What actually worries me is the cynicism of the government on vaccines. You have ministers that do not know what they are talking about actually questioning the validity of vaccines as if we have other credible alternatives

“Without vaccines, without testing people, without provision of social service safety nets to those that are locked up, without the provision of a fiscal package to businesses particularly small businesses that are hit hard by Covid-19 the economy is going to sink,” added the former minister.

Biti also said the foreign currency auction system was being mismanaged while reiterating his position that SI 33 of 2019 which de-dollarised the country was a disaster because “we tried to de-dollarise when the conditions to do so simply did not exist.”

“What worries me about the exchange rate is that it is a rigged exchange rate. If you look at the exchange rate from June to now, it has averaged and flattened at 1:82 but Zimbabwe is a very weak economy. I presented the State of the Economy address on behalf of the MDC Alliance sometime last year and one of the things I did was to compare the movement of the US dollar to the Rand, the US dollar to the Euro…

“Those graphs were implosive, they were a series of ups and downs and they reflected volatility yet these are stronger currencies than Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean graph was flat yet it’s a small, struggling, captured economy.

“What this means is that John Mangudya (RBZ Governor) and his colleagues are rigging the Dutch auction system and the markets react, which is why the parallel market rate is shooting because nobody believes Mangudya, nobody believes Eddie Cross, nobody believes the RBZ. It goes back to what I said, that the real price on this economy is lack of trust.

The MDC Alliance vice president said this had the effect of devaluing people’s wages which then has led to the collapse of various sectors such as the public health, education among others.",Zimbabwe’s 2021 Economic Prospects Not Promising: Biti,www.zimbabwesituation.com
821,822,https://www.sott.net/article/447661-Planning-the-first-battle-in-Bidens-America-MAGA-vs-The-GOP,"Multiple preexisting socio-political fault lines are rapidly rising to the surface in Biden's America, but among the few examples of friction that might actually be to the country's ultimate benefit will arguably be the one between the Trump-inspired ""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) movement and the Republicans (the ""Grand Old Party"", GOP), as the former has the chance to politically smash the latter by simultaneously founding a third party in parallel with putting immense pressure upon their counterpart's leadership from within in an attempt to take wrest control of the party if successful.Biden's America is rapidly bringing multiple preexisting socio-political fault lines to the surface, but this might actually be to the country's ultimate benefit if the friction between the Trump-inspired ""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) movement and the Republicans (the ""Grand Old Party"", GOP) becomes the first battle defining this new era. MAGA has the chance to politically smash the GOP by simultaneously founding a third party in parallel with putting immense pressure upon their counterparts' leadership from within in an attempt to wrest control of the party if successful. Former President Trump's unexpected decision to throw in the towel and give up fighting what he vehemently believed was the unprecedented electoral and voter fraud that resulted in current President Biden's certification by the Electoral College and influenced the storming of the US Capitol on the same day earlier this month provoked an irreparable rift between MAGA and the GOP. Many of the former now want nothing to do with the latter.MAGA was symbolically led by Trump and he'll likely continue to exert the most powerful influence over it,Members followed his lead, and that's why many previously politically apathetic people and even former Democrats and those who used to support third parties voted for the GOP simply because he ran on its ticket during the last two elections. Trump embodied the spirit of MAGA after coining the movement's name and bringing together its many disparate members who had hitherto lacked a platform upon which to organize in pursuit of their deeply held beliefs. The former President also courted many folks who would have earlier described themselves as ""establishment/traditional Republicans"" prior to them being inspired by the articulation of his fresh views which quite a few of them were never exposed to before. These fast-moving socio-political dynamics made GOP elites fear that that they were beginning to lose control of their own party through this peaceful revolution within it.Many of its members, both new and old alike, had been under the impression prior to the rise of MAGA that the GOP represented limited government and stood in support of conservative social values. That might have been what it originally stood for, but not any longer after having been silently taken over by what are nowadays described as the ""Republicans In Name Only"", or RINOs, who are essentially a superficially more conservative version of the liberal Democrats that only occasionally spews right-wing talking points in order to win votes ahead of upcoming elections.the latter of which have merged with the GOP's Trotskyist ("" deep state ""). This was the worst-kept secret in contemporary American politics, but was finally exposed as the most enduring element of Trump's legacy to America.The GOP is now facing an existential crisis in the face of the looming large-scale defections of MAGA members following Trump's departure from office, which could spoil the Democrats' grand plans to impose a de facto one-party dictatorship upon the country. The US might be saved from the "" dystopian hellhole "" that Biden's America is on the path to creating if the Democrats' plans are ruined as as result, since everything that they're planning is dependent first and foremost on the RINO-dominated GOP continuing to function as the controlled opposition making all of this possible in perpetuity. The GOP must therefore keep as many MAGA members within its ranks as possible otherwise the Democrats' de facto one-party dictatorship will always run the risk of being reversed, even if it takes some time to actually happen. Confronted with this credible threat to their joint rule of the country, the RINOs are resorting to their typical tactic of trying to scare their base into voting for them once more as the false solution to the de facto one-party problem that they themselves helped create.MAGA members mustn't be misled by the false hope that the presently RINO-dominated GOP will do anything to stop the Democrats' de facto one-party plansNo one should ever forget that thewith whom they see eye-to-eye in terms of indefinitely perpetuating the worst-kept secret in contemporary American politics, the country's de facto one-party rule that Trump tried to dismantle through his ultimately unsuccessful attempt to ""drain the swamp"". What needs to immediately happen is that MAGA members must simultaneously pioneer the creation of a third party in parallel with putting immense pressure upon the GOP from within in an attempt to wrest control of the party if successful.Regarding the first of these two primary objectives, it's possible that Trump might soon found the so-called "" Patriot Party "" according to reports, which they could all assemble under in that event. If he doesn't, then MAGA's most prominent community members must proactively organize in this direction. Whether through the ""Patriot Party"" or whichever other one might be created, MAGA must ensure that the movement remains united, which can only be achieved by reading, rereading, sharing, and educating everyone about the findings from Trump's 1776 Commission that Biden immediately disbanded as one of his first acts in office. This 45-page report concisely articulates the vision of America that every MAGA member is aspiring for as well as the existential threat facing their country's unique governing system by the rise of Democrat-driven identity politics. It should be regarded as mandatory reading for all MAGA members without exception, and discussion groups must pop among within each local MAGA community to talk about these ideas and teach them to others.MAGA theory can be transformed into praxis in two complementary ways. Just like the Poles peacefully organized nationwide through their 1980s ""Solidarity"" movement, so too can MAGA do the same through the establishment of an "" American Solidarity "" counterpart. This vanguard element of their movement would be responsible for peaceful protests and other non-violent forms of resistance to Biden's America such as the creative employment of the Color Revolution technologies masterminded by Gene Sharp , especially those described in detail in his famous works From Dictatorship To Democracy and There Are Realistic Alternatives . Just like the Democrats have Antifa and ""Black Lives Matter"" as their party's most politically active presence in the streets, so too must MAGA have ""American Solidarity"", though the latter must of course remain within legal limits and protest peacefully at all times unlike its ultra-radical left-wing counterparts. Without ""American Solidarity"", MAGA might fade into obscurity as an increasingly censored online-only movement.The second means for transforming MAGA theory into praxis is to launch a full-scale political rebellion within the GOP through legal and peaceful means. All MAGA members within this controlled opposition party must immediately stop donating to it and cancel their memberships. That's the only way to make the RINOs realize that their betrayal of the party's ideals and its former President is absolutely unacceptable to their base. The RINOs will lose their importance to their Democrat patrons if they're no longer capable of managing MAGA, which might provoke an intra-elite fault line in response that could be exploited by the Trump-inspired movement. MAGA must also immediatelywhether by supporting those few legitimate members of the GOP who still support the party's original ideals of small government and social conservatism or other third-party forces such as their own or whichever else might be most politically convenient depending on the local electoral context.Under no circumstances whatsoever should MAGA members continue to listen to, let alone support, the RINO-dominated GOP controlled opposition. That junior power structure which crucially upholds and superficially ""legitimizes"" their Democrat patrons' de facto one-party rule in Biden's America must be undermined at all costs, both from outside through the formation of a third-party force as well as simultaneously from within through MAGA's political rebellion aimed at wresting control of the party. The GOP, in terms of its present role as a RINO-dominated Democrat front for de facto one-party rule, is the most immediate political enemy of all MAGA members. It can, however, function as a force for good if MAGA eventually wrests control of it from the RINOs and then encourages their third-party force to support the GOP during the next elections in order to have the greatest impact. Even so, their third-party force must always remain institutionally independent of the GOP from here on out lest MAGA once again loses control of the latter to the RINOs.The de facto one-party dictatorship that the Democrats plan to impose on the rest of the country throughout the course of the ""dystopian hellhole"" that's more ""politely"" referred to as Biden's America can be averted if the RINO-dominated GOP controlled opposition is undermined from within and without by MAGA. The false hope that the party's present elite represent is the weak link in the system upholding and superficially ""legitimizing"" this anti-democratic state of affairs, hence why it must be politically opposed by those many members of its base that have been misled and exploited by the RINOs for far too long. Instead of submitting to their fearmongering that this one-party outcome would be facilitated by the RINOs political overthrow, MAGA must realize that such an outcome canbe averted by successfully wresting control of the GOP from those Democrat proxies.",Planning the first battle in Biden's America: MAGA vs. The GOP --,www.sott.net
822,823,https://www.kuer.org/2021-01-23/dolores-huerta-reacts-to-cesar-chavez-bust-in-bidens-oval-office,"Let's go back to the new administration now. New presidents and their families are expected to put their own personal touches on White House decor. So it was for the start of President Biden's tenure this week. On Wednesday, Inauguration Day, Biden sat down in a newly redecorated Oval Office to sign his first executive orders. And one piece of art stood out, positioned right behind him, nestled amid a group of Biden family photos. It was a bronze bust of the late civil rights activist and labor leader Cesar Chavez.

Chavez dedicated his life to advocating for farmworkers. He pushed for better wages and working conditions and was one of the founders of the United Farm Workers of America, or UFW. Dolores Huerta, a famed activist in her own right is also a co-founder of the United Farm Workers. She worked alongside Chavez for many years, so we called her to hear her thoughts on this moment. And she is with us now.

Dolores Huerta, welcome back. Thank you so much for talking with us.

DOLORES HUERTA: Well, thank you for inviting me.

MARTIN: So what was your reaction when you heard that President Biden had chosen to honor Cesar Chavez so prominently in the Oval Office?

HUERTA: It's really a very strong message that the strongest person in the whole world, the president of the United States of America, would have a bust of Cesar Chavez, a very simple, humble farmworker, a leader, a person who stood up for gun violence, who dedicated his life to make life better for the poorest of the poor - to me, that was a very strong message. And it really indicated that the president is saying to everybody, I am your servant leader, and I am here to serve you.

MARTIN: And I'm not trying to make you the spokesperson, you know, for all Latinos. But we couldn't think of another Latino leader who has been so honored with a presence in the Oval Office - I mean, that his likeness is there, along with other iconic figures in U.S. history - Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln. And I just wondered, does this - how does this speak to you as a Latino?

HUERTA: Well, a very strong healing moment, I think, for all Latinos, especially when we have been under such vicious attack under the Trump administration. It was an acknowledgment, and it was not only for Latinos. I think it was for all people of color. And it was also a big acknowledgment, I think, for all working people and for labor unions also.

MARTIN: And I do want to mention that you endorsed Joe Biden for president last May, but you also were part of that celebratory event which was held on the evening of Inauguration Day in lieu of balls because of COVID You know, people aren't having those big parties, and so there was a big - kind of a big television show performance that you were a part of, that you read words from a prior president - so so many important and symbolic moves. But I assume that you're not just interested in symbolism. What other moves are you looking for?

HUERTA: Well, you know, we have a lot of work to do, and then to support President Biden in healing the country and bringing the country together. And the words that I spoke were from Franklin Delano Roosevelt about being afraid of fear itself. And I think that we have a lot of fear in our country, and we have to remove the fear, and we have to go forward.

MARTIN: So what has this last four years been for you? I'm just wondering how you've navigated these last four years when there was leadership in the country that very much was opposed to many of the things that you worked your life for. And I wondered if you were disheartened at any point.

HUERTA: Well, it was very disheartening to think of so many things that we have worked for - trying to get social justice, racial equality, women's equality, income equality - and to see that we were taking so many steps backward. So it's very refreshing to know that now we can go forward, that we have a new president, a new vice president, and that - people that have the same values as most of the American people.

MARTIN: And what do you think that President Biden's priorities should be? I mean, he's done a lot of - taken a lot of moves in the first couple of days. I mean, he's signed a number of executive orders on things like workplace safety during the ongoing pandemic, immigration reform, just to name just a couple of - what do you think his priorities should be?

HUERTA: Well, we know that one of them is to try to control the pandemic and, of course, try to bring our economy back to health. But also, I believe I - begin by having the (unintelligible) challenges also making a big brushstroke against hatred and against xenophobia and the racism that we've seen manifest itself. And this is very, very important because we can't bring our country back together until we start respecting each other.

MARTIN: So before we let you go, you've seen the bust that's in the office, right? I mean, it's borrowed from the Cesar Chavez Foundation, so you've seen it. Do you like the bust?

HUERTA: Well, I think it's a very beautiful bust. Yes. It's a very beautiful bust. And it's - of course, it's in the likeness of the ones that they did for - of President Kennedy and for Robert Kennedy and for Dr. King.

827,828,https://www.fox5ny.com/news/3000-arrested-at-protests-in-russia-demanding-navalnys-release,"Russian police arrested more than 3,000 people Saturday in nationwide protests demanding the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's most prominent foe, according to a group that counts political detentions.

The protests in scores of cities in temperatures as low as minus-50 C (minus-58 F) highlighted how Navalny has built influence far beyond the political and cultural centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg.

In Moscow, an estimated 15,000 demonstrators gathered in and around Pushkin Square in the city center, where clashes with police broke out and demonstrators were roughly dragged off by helmeted riot officers to police buses and detention trucks. Some were beaten with batons.

Navalny’s wife Yulia was among those arrested.

Police eventually pushed demonstrators out of the square. Thousands then regrouped along a wide boulevard about a kilometer (half-mile) away, many of them throwing snowballs at the police before dispersing.

Some later went to protest near the jail where Navalny is held. Police made an undetermined number of arrests there.

The protests stretched across Russia’s vast territory, from the island city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk north of Japan and the eastern Siberian city of Yakutsk, where temperatures plunged to minus-50 Celsius, to Russia’s more populous European cities. Navalny and his anti-corruption campaign have built an extensive network of support despite official government repression and being routinely ignored by state media.

""The situation is getting worse and worse, it’s total lawlessness,"" said Andrei Gorkyov, a protester in Moscow. ""And if we stay silent, it will go on forever.""

The OVD-Info group, which monitors political arrests, said at least 941 people were detained in Moscow and more than 350 at another large demonstration in St. Petersburg. Overall, it said 3,454 people had been arrested in some 90 cities. Russian police did not provide arrest figures.

Undeterred, Navalny's supporters called for protests again next weekend.

Navalny was arrested on Jan. 17 when he returned to Moscow from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a severe nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin and which Russian authorities deny. Authorities say his stay in Germany violated terms of a suspended sentence in a 2014 criminal conviction, while Navalny says the conviction was for made-up charges.

The 44-year-old activist is well known nationally for his reports on the corruption that has flourished under President Vladimir Putin's government.

His wide support puts the Kremlin in a strategic bind — risking more protests and criticism from the West if it keeps him in custody but apparently unwilling to back down by letting him go free.

Navalny faces a court hearing in early February to determine whether his sentence in the criminal case for fraud and money-laundering — which Navalny says was politically motivated — is converted to 3 1/2 years behind bars.

Moscow police on Thursday arrested three top Navalny associates, two of whom were later jailed for periods of nine and 10 days.

Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on Aug. 20. He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to the Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.

Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning. Russia refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned.

Last month, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as fake.

Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side for a decade, unusually durable in an opposition movement often demoralized by repressions.

He has been jailed repeatedly in connection with protests and twice was convicted of financial misdeeds in cases that he said were politically motivated. He suffered significant eye damage when an assailant threw disinfectant into his face. He was taken from jail to a hospital in 2019 with an illness that authorities said was an allergic reaction but which many suspected was a poisoning.","3,000 arrested at protests in Russia demanding Navalny's release",www.fox5ny.com
828,829,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/01/24/news/world/thailand-hospital-rolls-out-cannabis-meals/831354/,"PRACHINBURI: From spicy “happy” salads to soups sprinkled with cannabis shoots and deep-fried marijuana leaves — a Thai hospital restaurant has rolled out a weed-inspired menu which has curious customers flocking to sample its euphoria-inducing offerings.

Since becoming the first Southeast Asian country to legalize medical marijuana in 2018, Thailand has ploughed ahead on the extraction, distillation and marketing of cannabis oil — eager to capitalize on the multibillion-dollar industry.

The plant itself was finally removed from the kingdom’s narcotics list last month, which means licensed providers — like hospitals — can now use its leaves, stems and roots in food.

This marks a return to Thailand’s culinary past, said doctor Pakakrong Kwankhao, who heads the Centre of Evidence-based Thai Traditional and Herbal Medicine in Chao Phya Abhaibhubejhr Hospital.

“Putting cannabis leaves in the food is our culture,” she told Agence France-Presse Friday.

“In the past before cannabis was banned… we put small amounts as seasoning herbs and we also use it as a herbal remedy.”

Last week, the hospital’s wellness center, which has a restaurant, introduced a new menu of Thai dishes offering a different sort of kick.

In the restaurant’s bustling kitchen, a cook batters marijuana leaves and fries them to golden crispness, while another sprinkles them in a wok of minced meat with chili.

There are very small amounts of THC in fresh plants, but to avoid over-consumption, the restaurant has a five-leaf maximum limit per customer, said Pakakrong.

“If they have low tolerance, then they may choose the dish with just a half-leaf,” she said, warning that those who are pregnant or with certain health problems should avoid the weed-infused menu.

As for other interested foodies, “recent research found that this small amount can improve mood, focus and also creativity,” the doctor said.

She added that the restaurant hopes to expand its budding menu to include western fare.

For now, it draws a crowd during lunch, with diners snapping selfies while growing increasingly mirthful with each passing hour.

“Are we laughing because of what we’ve eaten? I don’t think completely anyway,” said customer Thierry Martino, a French jewelry designer.

“The cannabis leaf which (the dish) is cooked with gives a little bit of bitterness,” he said, adding that his meal was “excellent.”

Arsala Chaocharoen says she’s eating in the same way ancient Thais used to dine.

“They’ve put the cannabis leaves in my noodle soup and this is actually an old traditional knowledge of Thais,” said the 32-year-old pharmacist, before digging into her “joyfully happy spicy salad” — a dish of corn-battered leaves served with chili sauce.",Thailand hospital rolls out cannabis meals –,www.manilatimes.net

830,831,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-hhs-sec-leavitt-state-vaccination-plans-too-granular-slowing-distribution-down,"Former Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt said Saturday that state coronavirus vaccination plans are ""getting too granular,"" in turn slowing distribution.

Leavitt, who is also the former Governor of Utah and former EPA administrator, said that he’s less concerned with manufacturers being able to produce vaccines quickly enough and more concerned with ""being able to get it to the arms of people.""

""My suggestion is we have to realize from what we've learned so far, they're getting too granular in the way we pass this out slows us down,"" Leavitt said on ""America’s News HQ."" ""I think the goal ought to be get as many places issuing or administering the vaccine as possible and just get it to available arms.""

Still, amid a rollout that has frustrated Americans still unable to get the shot, Leavitt expressed optimism for the weeks ahead. ""I think within a few weeks we're going to see this become a much better-oiled machine, if you will, and that we'll see improvement.""

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has issued guidelines for ""Phase 1a"" through ""Phase 1c,"" starting with healthcare workers and residents of long term care facilities, but has left the ultimate decision up to states for who gets the jab when.

On Thursday the CDC quietly changed its guidelines to say that the first and second dose could be spaced six weeks apart, rather than three.

Some governors have enacted narrower vaccine qualifications than others, and some have relaxed their stringent guidelines after an underwhelming rollout.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had stuck to rigid guidelines allowing only health care workers and long term care residents to get the jab and threatening healthcare providers with fines up to $1 million if they offered it to anyone else. He was looking for nearly all in those groups to have gotten the vaccine before moving to the next category.

But after reports of unused or spoiled supply and begging from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and other officials, the Democratic governor expanded eligibility to include other frontline workers and those over 75. On Thursday, the governor’s office boasted that 93 percent of first doses New York had received from the federal government had been put to use, and lamented that the state would run out of vaccine before its next shipment.

CDC SAYS COVID-19 VACCINE CAN BE GIVEN 6 WEEKS APART

The CDC has said about 17.4 million people have received at least one dose of their Covid vaccine and over 3 million people have been fully vaccinated.

The federal government said Saturday it had delivered 41.4 million doses to states. Federal health officials in the past have said they do not have a clear understanding why only a portion of doses shipped across the nation have been used.

According to data from this week, West Virginia led the pack administering the highest percentage of doses it had received at 72.28 percent, followed by North Dakota, South Dakota, New Mexico and Connecticut. Alabama was last, having only distributed 33.65 percent of the vaccine it’d been given, behind Virginia, California, Arizona and Georgia.","Former HHS Sec.

831,832,https://www.npr.org/transcripts/959394422,"May 1970, in a room best known for reverberating with the sounds of the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane, three masters of Indian classical music took the stage for a celebration of Indian ragas. The concert was recorded by another legend at the time, Owsley Stanley, the man who designed the Dead's innovative sound system as well as making what was, well, reputed to be the best LSD of the day. That recording has finally been released. It's called ""That Which Colors The Mind."" Bilal Qureshi has the story.

BILAL QURESHI, BYLINE: On that Friday night 50 years ago, Indian sarod master Ali Akbar Khan was joined on stage by a 19-year-old percussionist named Zakir Hussain.

ZAKIR HUSSAIN: I was very young, that's true. And I had just arrived in America a few months before, just trying to still find my way around the country and trying to understand the slang. The words like far-out and groovy and all weren't quite registering.

QURESHI: The language of the hippie generation may not have registered for Zakir Hussain, but sitar maestro Ravi Shankar had already electrified the Woodstock and Monterey Pop festivals. And the audience in San Francisco that night was primed to listen.

HUSSAIN: In India, I was used to playing with the audience, chiming in, everybody saying wow and kya baat and do that again and all that stuff. But here, the audience was quiet, eyes closed, meditative. The room was dark, so you couldn't really make eye contact with the audience. And so you were left to rely on your interaction with your fellow musicians and to see how that conversation unfolds.

QURESHI: Since his first American concerts, Zakir Hussain has become the world's most famous tabla player. He now lives in California, and he says it was this performance 50 years ago that showed him that Indian classical music could be played in the West in its purest form.

HUSSAIN: It really set the tone of how I would present myself to my fellow musician, whoever I was accompanying, for the rest of my life.

QURESHI: Capturing the performance in the highest fidelity possible was the goal of Owsley Stanley, the man known as The Bear, and more famously as the Grateful Dead's soundman.

HUSSAIN: He was a man who ran around like a madman on stage and trip over wires and fall and curse. And it was obvious that this was a guy who was possessed. This was a guy who knew what needed to be done about how this music should be presented to those who were not there. I mean, Bear had this idea that the music should be heard in a way where people can close their eyes and actually see where the musicians are seated.

STARFINDER STANLEY: His objective with his recordings was to try to capture the audience's experience so that he could improve the sound system.

QURESHI: That's Starfinder Stanley, the late Owsley son and head of the Owsley Stanley Foundation.

STANLEY: He was an audiophile who was born in a low-fidelity world. And the sound systems for rock ’n’ roll when he got involved were pretty rudimentary. And he wanted it to be better. And he called his tapes his sonic journals. They were his working diary so that he could improve the sound.

QURESHI: The foundation has begun restoring Stanley's tapes and releasing the music. Hawk Semins is the executive producer of the series.

HAWK SEMINS: He had collected about 1,300 reels of 80 different artists and nearly every idiom that you can imagine of music.

QURESHI: From Miles Davis to Janis Joplin, Semins says these live recordings capture the magic of the '60s and '70s Bay Area music scene.

SEMINS: It's just absolutely remarkable, the mix that's reflected the contacts that there were, the openness of the scene, the open-mindedness of the scene in terms of the various musical influences. So you've got Ali Akbar Khan one night, and you've got Commander Cody another night, and you've got the Grateful Dead another night. And they were all listening to each other. And they were all playing with each other.

QURESHI: It was a time for expanding consciousness. And while Starfinder Stanley acknowledges his father's role in chemically altering the minds of that scene's participants, he insists the music was Owsley Stanley's real drug. And Zakir Hussain says that idea is captured in the new album's title.

HUSSAIN: Thousands of years back, there was a man, a genius named Bharata in India, and he wrote many treaties. And one of them is called Bharata’s ""Natya Shastra."" And one thing it says about raga - it says rangati iti raga, which means that which colors the mind is a raga. And that ties into this recording, the title.

QURESHI: Starfighter Stanley says he hopes the recordings can introduce a new generation to a pivotal moment in American music history, as genres and cultures cross-pollinated in a spirit of openness and dialogue.

STANLEY: I think especially with all the chaos that's going on in the world right now, people need music. They need to take a breath, take a step back, stop doomscrolling through all the crazy stuff that's going on and let this into your mind and let it soothe that internal monologue. And this album in particular is great for that. It just transports you.",When The Giants Of Indian Classical Music Collided With Psychedelic San Francisco,www.npr.org

Health leaders have always urged testing, but say it’s especially important now because the variant spreads more readily than the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has been in circulation since March. They want to be able to accurately track cases and spread.

“The new variant is present in Michigan and we are at risk of seeing more spread of COVID-19. Everyone should do their part to end this pandemic.

At least that's what the law says. But what happens when children are learning at home? That's uncharted territory. Reporter Kristin Gourlay learns more from a parent who is deaf about what it's like to help her young children, who can hear.

KRISTIN GOURLAY, BYLINE: Rosabella Manzanares is in first grade, and she has a spelling test today. Her teacher, Peggy Perry at Betsy Ross Elementary, just outside Chicago, is trying to corral a screen full of wiggly 6-year-olds on Zoom.

PEGGY PERRY: Rosabella is here, so we can go ahead and take our spelling test.

GOURLAY: Rosabella sails through the last of the 10 words.

PERRY: Rosabella, how'd you do? I see Mommy grading your paper. Thumbs-up?

GOURLAY: Rosabella can hear. Her mother, Chantelly Manzanares, is deaf. Manzanares uses American Sign Language, or ASL, which is different than English. It's a visual language. It has its own grammar. It uses different sentence structure. Rosabella and her siblings grew up using ASL. But while they've become fluent in English, Manzanares is not. She can grade this spelling test, which Rosabella holds up to the screen with a big smile, but it can be tough for Manzanares to help with other work in English. Manzanares tells me through an ASL interpreter that before the pandemic...

CHANTELLY MANZANARES: (Through interpreter) The neighbor would help us, which was great because my English isn't - you know, it's not my first language. Between the school and the neighbor, everything was covered.

GOURLAY: Now that the kids are home all day, Manzanares says she can't provide the same benefits as the physical school environment.

C MANZANARES: (Through interpreter) So being out, hearing people speak, using their voices, that becomes a more rich - English-rich environment.

GOURLAY: For extra support, she's found a volunteer to read to Rosabella over Zoom. But there's another challenge. Manzanares wants to keep up with what's happening during class in case she needs to jot down a reminder or help her daughter. So Rosabella says, as her baby sister wobbles by, that she interprets for her mom.

ROSABELLA: She asks me what they're saying 'cause she can't hear, and I tell her what they're saying.

GOURLAY: Manzanares signs that she doesn't want to burden Rosabella with too much interpreting. Nor does teacher Peggy Perry.

PERRY: A lot of times, what I'll do now is before we hang up, I'll say, you know, Rosabella, I want to see you tell Mommy that we have, you know, science at 1:30. And that seems to be working really well because we can't expect 6-year-olds to remember everything, right?

GOURLAY: Manzanares can text Perry if she needs to. And Manzanares says she feels more supported now than when the pandemic began.

But not all parents are feeling that way. Robyn Powell is with the National Research Center for Parents with Disabilities at Brandeis University. She says even before the pandemic, schools haven't always lived up to their commitment to accommodate parents and caregivers with disabilities.

ROBYN POWELL: So the pandemic has really - I think two things - exposed some really long-standing inequities that have always existed. But really, the pandemic has brought them to light. And it's also shown us what we don't know.

GOURLAY: Like what a deaf parent might need to help her hearing child at home. Powell's center recently hosted a Twitter chat for parents with a range of disabilities. She says participants expressed frustration over what schools are expecting of them, like this parent.

POWELL: It was from a blind mother. And she talked about one of the biggest challenges she had was now she was supposed to be teaching her child how to write - handwrite. And she can't see the handwriting.

GOURLAY: Robyn Powell says, keep in mind this is on top of the stress of living through a pandemic for parents and kids and schools.

 Government is engaging countries that are developing Covid19 vaccines to explore options for uptake in the country, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has said.

Mnangagwa said there was hope for Zimbabwe to secure the much needed vaccines.

 “Government has and is engaging countries which have developed vaccines. Help and relief are on the way,” he said.

“Our experts who have been assessing different vaccines,(and) are very close to finalising the course to recommend to our Nation.”

 Mnangagwa, who was addressing the nation yesterday, added that vaccines will be rolled out across the country.

Turning to Zimbabwe’s Covid19 statistics, Mnangagwa said figures in the country were a cause for concern as cases continue to rise and more people were dying daily.

“The situation is very worrisome, and threatens to become dire,” the President said.

 “The numbers of infections have gone past 30 000, with indications pointing to more infections in the coming hours, days, weeks and even months. To date, we have lost over 962 of our beloved, and soon, we will reach and even pass the grim mark of a thousand.”

Mnangagwa’s statement came at a time when Zimbabwe has lost four prominent Zanu PF members in one day, among them Transport Minister, Joel Biggie Matiza, former Education minister Mashonaland provincial Affairs minister

Aenias Chigwedere, ex-Zanu PF Harare provincial chairman and MP businessman Christopher Chigumba and former prisons Chief Paradzai Zimondi to coronavirus. They all succumbed in a space of hours of each other.

As of this Saturday, 31 007 cases and 974 had been recorded.

The poet’s dohas are so popular even today that folk artistes sing these on stage during Dayro. Joshi immortalized his works, but he himself perished into oblivion,” Dave said.Dave contacted Joshi’s nephews and found the manuscripts in their home. “Joshi was a true Gandhian and was distressed after the assassination of Mahatma.

As the inoculation programme moves through priority groups, several health board areas are beginning to send out letters telling those in the age group when they will receive their first dose of the Covid-19 jab.

Health Secretary Jeane Freeman urged people to look out for the “very distinctive” envelopes, which are being given priority by Royal Mail.

A new booking system is also being used by several health boards to schedule appointments for patients in order of priority.

Greater Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Lothian are among the NHS boards which will use the system.

The Scottish Government said they are on track for all those aged 80 and over to have received their first dose of the vaccine by the end of the first week in February.

This age group will not receive a blue envelope as they are being contacted by telephone or another form of letter.

Ms Freeman said: “We all know how easy it is to ignore some of the mail which comes through our letterboxes but these blue envelopes will be very distinctive and they will contain details of your vaccine appointment so please open them.

“The letters are being posted first class and we have been advised by the Royal Mail that the colour will allow them to prioritise delivery.

“The blue envelopes will contain information about the time and place of your appointment and details on how to reschedule it if you are unable to attend.

“I would urge everyone to take up their appointment when they are offered one.

“The vaccination programme is one of three key ways we are working to beat this virus, along with our expanded testing programme to identify cases and break chains of transmission and the important lockdown restrictions everyone in Scotland must follow.

But no official cause of death has been released, and U.S. Capitol Police have said only that he died “due to injuries sustained while on-duty.”

A Texas man is facing multiple criminal charges after allegedly participating in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and posting death threats against Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, and a U.S. Capitol police officer.

The Department of Justice revealed that Garret Miller faces five criminal charges, including trespassing and making death threats.

Using the initials widely used to refer to the New York Democrat, Miller tweeted ""assassinate AOC"" hours after he posted pictures of himself storming the Capitol. That tweet was in response to one in which Ocasio-Cortez called for President Donald Trump to be impeached, which he was a week later on a charge of inciting the mob of his supporters.

According to the criminal complaint, Miller was particularly incensed by the fatal shooting of one of those supporters, Ashli Babbitt, during the attack. On Jan. 10, Miller is alleged to have threatened the Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, saying on Instagram he was going to ""hug his neck with a nice rope."" Six days later, he said the officer deserved to die and that it was ""huntin season.""

Miller was arrested on Jan. 20 and made his first court appearance Friday. Miller’s detention hearing is set for Monday.

Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Friday about Miller's arrest, quoting his Facebook comment that he ""just wanted to incriminate myself a little.""

""Well, you did,"" she wrote.

The FBI linked Miller to the attack on the Capitol through a video posted by Twitter user @garretamiller that was captioned ""From inside congress"" and was filmed inside the Capitol rotunda. The Twitter account was registered under a cell phone number belonging to Miller, a subpoena for AT&T revealed. The FBI also found several posts relating to the attack on Miller's Facebook account.

""I am about to drive across the country for this trump s---,"" Miller wrote in a Jan. 2 post. ""Some crazy s--- going to happen this week. Dollar might collapse ... civil war could start ... not sure what to do in DC.""

The complaint also stated that Miller posted a photo of himself and another rioter inside the Capitol on Facebook and was seen on surveillance video from inside the rotunda.

In response to Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet saying to ""impeach"" Trump, Miller claimed, ""We acted with honor"" and in another post he claimed the crowd had been ""gentle."" But video of the attack has revealed violent attacks on police officers, one of whom died. The Associated Press, citing unidentified sources, reported that the officer who died, Brian Sicknick, may have been hit in the head by a fire extinguisher. But no official cause of death has been released, and U.S. Capitol Police have said only that he died “due to injuries sustained while on-duty” and provided no other details.

According to the criminal complaint, Miller later said on Instagram that he had a rope in his bag when he entered the Capitol. And in another post, he said, ""next time we bring the guns.""

Clint Broden, Miller's attorney told The Associated Press in an email that Miller regrets the actions he took in support of the former president.

""His social media comments reflect very ill-considered political hyperbole in very divided times and will certainly not be repeated in the future,"" Broden said in the email. ""He looks forward to putting all of this behind him.""

During an Instagram Live with the New York congresswoman after the attack on the Capitol, Ocasio-Cortez told viewers that she had ""a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die"" and that she didn't ""know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive.""

Death threats aren't new for Ocasio-Cortez. In 2019, she said that she receives them ""every day.""

Another man was arrested in 2020 after threatening Ocasio-Cortez. Timothy Ireland of Ohio was arrested in May last year after Capitol Police received a tip that he wrote that Ocasio-Cortez ""should be shot"" on Facebook. Ireland later admitted to the statement, saying he was proud of it, according to a case affidavit.

According to court documents, agents from the U.S. Capitol Police and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found seven rounds of ammunition in Ireland's home. He eventually pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of ammunition.","Texas man charged after storming US Capitol, making death threats against Rep.

TOLEDO, Ohio — Loved ones and strangers came together as one outside the Safety Building in downtown Toledo on Saturday afternoon to support Officer Brandon Stalker's family, and brothers and sisters in blue.

""It's been really hard. He was my only boy, he was my best friend,"" said Cosette Stalker, Officer Stalker's mother.

Stalker was shot and killed in the line of duty, while working perimeter security at a standoff in central Toledo on Monday.

""He loved everybody, always had a smile on his face, would do anything for anybody,"" said Stalker's mother.

The heartbreak is a feeling many are still coming to terms with, including one of Officer Stalker's best friends of more than 10 years, Lynn Allison.

""It's definitely been hard, it's unreal still. It's hit me but it hasn't hit me, if that makes sense,"" said Allison.

They are still in shock and denial but, grateful for the encouragement that's been coming in.

""When we see the amount of support from not just Toledoans, but Michigan, all across the country. I've been getting phone calls and letters and phone calls"" said Chief Kral. ""It really means a lot to the officers to know that while what happened was tragic, they still have the majority of the people's support.""

Officer Stalker is the second Toledo police officer shot and killed in the line of duty in the last year. Officer Anthony Dia was killed by a gunman on July 4, 2020.

As it was after Dia's murder, support for Officer Stalker's family and his fellow police officers has been in full force in the days following the tragic shooting, even from people who never knew the 24-year-old.

""I feel really bad that this does happen. Because it shouldn't happen. People need to respect the police officers more. So, I come down here often to pray at the rosary for the Toledo Police and all the police officers,"" said Toledoan Kristi Kille.

Health officials are responding to a new case of coronavirus in the community in Northland.

The case involves a woman who was released from an MIQ facility - Auckland's Pullman hotel - on January 13. She used the Covid tracer app and about 30 locations have been identified where she visited after being released.

The list of locations is yet to be released but stretch from Mangawhai to Dargaville and Helensville in southern Northland. The woman lives just south of Whangarei.

Arrivals get tested on about the 12th day of a 14-day stay in managed isolation and are able to leave if the test is negative.

But it is possible the person was infected in the facility after her last test and was incubating Covid when she left.

Hipkins and director general of health Ashley Bloomfield will give more details at a press conference at the Beehive at 4pm today.

The last case of community transmission in New Zealand was on November 18.

Covid-19 modeller Professor Michael Plank said it was possible the virus was passed from one infected person to another in a managed isolation facility.

""One of the risks we've always been aware of is someone arrives with the virus, but then they pass it on to someone else in quarantine, perhaps near the end of their stay,"" said Plank, of the University of Canterbury and Te Punaha Matatini.

""That's one possible way the virus can leak out. I'm not saying that's what happened in this case, but it's a possibility, because it would be unlikely for someone to be incubating the virus for that length of time.""

University of Auckland Professor of Medicine Des Gorman said health experts would be scrambling to test the person's contacts.

""What's required now is to not only test the people who have been in direct contact like family members and so on - but also to start encouraging people to turn up and be tested en masse so that there can be some reassurance that there aren't any other cases in the community.""

Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said there was not yet any evidence of actual community ""transmission"" in Northland. ""It's still most likely this is a border case.""

At today's 1pm Covid update, the Ministry of Health announced there had been eight new Covid cases in managed isolation since Friday.

The cases came from South Africa (2), the UK, United Arab Emirates, the US (2), Ethiopia and India. Four travelled via UAE and Malaysia.

One previously reported case had recovered, the ministry said.

Tests have now detected 36 people arriving in New Zealand with highly contagious strains of the virus since they emerged late last year: 29 with the UK variant and seven with the South African variant.

In the past fortnight, 17 more people were in quarantine facilities infected with the variants.

Whole genome sequencing had identified 11 samples of B.1.1.7 (known as the UK variant) and six samples of B.1.3.5.1 (known as the South Africa variant).

The ministry warned the strains would continue to show up in managed isolation facilities across New Zealand.

The Government has introduced pre-flight testing from most countries to reduce the number of people arriving at the border with Covid-19. Covid tests are given to people on the day of arrival, as well as day three and day 12.

There are currently 79 active cases in quarantine and the total number of confirmed cases is 1927.

The total number of tests processed by laboratories to date is 1,487,234.

The seven-day rolling average up to yesterday is 3335 tests processed.

Kyle Rittenhouse was 17 during the Aug. 25 demonstration in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as hundreds were protesting the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man. Rittenhouse has been charged with multiple counts, including reckless and intentional homicide, endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm.

Prosecutors allege Rittenhouse, who is white, left his home in Antioch, Illinois, and traveled to Kenosha to answer a call for militia to protect businesses. Kenosha was in the throes of several nights of chaotic street demonstrations after a white officer shot Blake in the back during a domestic disturbance, leaving Blake paralyzed.

Rittenhouse opened fire with an assault-style rifle during the protest, killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, authorities said. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to all counts and argued he fired in self-defense. Conservatives have rallied around him, generating enough money to make his $2 million cash bail.

According to online court records, a Wisconsin judge modified Rittenhouse’s conditions of release on Friday to note Rittenhouse “shall not knowingly have conduct with any person or group of persons known to harm, threaten, harass or menace others on the basis of their race, beliefs on the subject of religion, color, national origin, or gender.”

He is also barred from possessing and consuming alcohol and from having firearms.

Prosecutors had requested the modifications after Rittenhouse was seen drinking at a bar in the southeastern Wisconsin city of Mount Pleasant, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Milwaukee, earlier this month. The legal drinking age is 21, but in Wisconsin, Rittenhouse could legally drink alcohol because he was with his mother.

According to WMTV, prosecutors wrote in their request that Rittenhouse also posed for a photo outside Pudgy’s Pub with two men as they made the “OK” sign with their hands, a symbol used by white supremacists. Prosecutors also alleged five men at the tavern serenaded Rittenhouse with a song that has become the anthem of the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist group.",Judge: Kenosha shooter can't associate with supremacists,www.sandiegouniontribune.com

849,850,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/2056035/wedding-no-show-covid-ghosts-casual-punch-in-the-mouth,"The family of a young bride stood up at her Isan wedding has turned down an offer from the groom's family to hold the wedding again next month, saying being duped once was enough.

The young bride, ""M"" (full name withheld) Yusamran, 15, was left to greet guests alone at her simple wedding, held under a rented tent at her home in Phra Thong Kham district of Nakhon Ratchasima, after the groom and her lover of seven months, Theeraphat Khemsuntia, 20, failed to show.

The bride's family posted pictures of the failed Jan 17 wedding and asked friends to share them. The story was taken up widely by the Thai media last week, amid claims that the bride's family pressured the groom into marriage after the groom had his way with the girl, who is underage.

Media reports said M's family laid a police complaint alleging the groom had absconded with the girl. Theeraphat's mother, Umaporn, 56, said she was worried her son would end up in jail, so asked to meet the family.

M's family demanded damages of 100,000 baht in return for dropping the legal action. But she told them her family had no money. ""So her family suggested they get married,"" Ms Umaporn said.

She was told to meet the family at the police station where she had to agree in writing to take responsibility for her son's actions by agreeing to marriage. ""I don't know what they wrote, but I signed it,"" she said, adding she had little education.

Ms Umaporn said her family is poor. Her son, like M herself, left school early and is unemployed. Just as she could not afford the damages, nor could she find the bridal price demanded by M's family, of 60,000 baht plus 1 baht's weight of gold.

""But they insisted I would have to find it; if I couldn't find it, they said I shouldn't bother turning up.""

Ms Umaporn said if her son and M love each other, they should be allowed to live together first without having to get married. After they find work they could save some money and get married later.

She claimed the bride's family didn't consult her about any of the wedding preparations. The groom's family contacted her the day before to say it was on, but she decided not to go as she still had not raised the bridal price. The bride's family had given her just three months to raise the sum, which was not enough.

""If the court decides my son has to go to jail, we will just have to live with it,"" she said. Theeraphat and M met on the internet. ""The girl came to see my son once or twice a week but didn't stay overnight,"" she said.

The bride's family, meanwhile, said it was left out of pocket by 119,000 baht as a result of the no-show.

Som Bunchert, M's father, said the family of five was forced to mortgage their land for 30,000 baht, borrow from friends and call on their savings to pay for the wedding. He is the main breadwinner, bringing in 200-300 baht a day by selling goods he finds in the local forest.

M's mother, Lamduan Bunchert, 36, said Theeraphat's mum had told her he would marry her daughter at the bridal price demanded. She had also signed the document agreeing to the deal. ""The groom's mother also proposed the wedding date, though she left me to organise the wedding and did not contribute any money,"" she said.

Theeraphat turned up the day before the wedding to help arrange the venue. Facebook images show the couple posing with friends and relatives; nothing seemed amiss.

She felt embarrassed about the turn of events, as guests included the tambon chief and everyone asked what had happened to the groom.

The day after, the groom sent a message saying sorry, and that he still loved her. However, he also asked if she really wanted him to go to jail.

Media reports say that after Theeraphat's no-show, the bride's family went to police, who persuaded them to lay charges of abduction and statutory rape against Theeraphat. The Daily News newspaper said he had made M pregnant before the bride's family urged the pair into marriage.

At the police station, Theeraphat told M's clan that if they wanted to recoup the cost of the wedding they would have to see him in court. He maintained M was just as keen on sex as he was. He denied media reports he fled, claiming his family was not told about the wedding until late and was not game to show as they did not have enough money.

Despite that, his mother Ms Umaporn later said she is willing to pay the bill for the wedding expenses, as the debts have left the bride's family struggling to feed itself. After talking to her son, who is still keen to get married, she has also suggested the couple try again next month, by which time she hopes to have raised the bridal price.

M's family, however, is having none of it. The young woman, who was shown crying with relatives on the day she was stood up, said she is too heartbroken to take such a step.

Her father, Mr Som, said they would not agree to another wedding, and nor were they willing to settle the legal case. ""If we hold another wedding we could be deceived again. My daughter is also very unhappy,"" he said.

An engineer who complained about living standards at a quarantine hotel in Ranong has been put in his place by local notables, saying he was too used to the good life and not willing to give hardship a go.

The engineer, who returned to Thailand recently after working in Myanmar, posted to Facebook last week, complaining about conditions at the state quarantine facility based at the old Jansom Hotel, once a landmark in the province.

He said he was given a room with no electricity, no water, no WiFi, no fridge. On a more comical note, he was told on the day he arrived that, in the absence of running water in the toilet, he should relieve himself over the balcony, and offer a wai of apology to the resident spirit.

He posted images of a lit candle in his darkened room, and a mold-covered, run-down looking balcony which overlooks an overgrown forest.

""I ask you, is this a suitable place to live? It's no surprise to me that some people flee quarantine, because it really tests the psyche,"" he complained on Jan 16.

""We have been forced to stay in an abandoned building, little different from what the homeless encounter,"" he grumbled. By 11pm, he said power and the pumped water supply had been restored.

His FB post was carried widely by the media, which likened the gloomy premises depicted in his post to a haunted hotel.

The publicity upset locals, who say the province had failed to tell them that people were being held in quarantine at the old hotel.

Traders contacted by Amarin TV said they were unhappy to know that people at risk of Covid-19 were staying nearby.

""Not only is the facility close to a community but is also nearby a local tourist attraction [the hot spa],"" one said.

He admitted some locals knew people were being held at the hotel, but for many the news came as a shock.

Meanwhile, a staff member working for a local MP, who was not identified, said the engineer critic was a pampered one who should try exercising a little tolerance.

He had inspected the place and it looked clean and safe. He agreed it was really just a place for sleeping, with few amenities.

However, he said few employers locally were prepared to let the state use their premises for quarantine, so the province had no choice. ""Trying looking past the little things and exercise a little tolerance,"" he advised.

Sathit Thimkam, a doctor from the Ministry of Public Health in Ranong, said staff were still looking for suitable venues for quarantine.

""If he wants facilities like those of a hotel he can find them elsewhere for a fee: 40,000 baht for a 14-day stay,"" he said.

Somkiart Sisaneht, governor of Ranong, said the province had used the old Jansom Hotel for quarantine since last year. ""The engineer was responding to momentary stress.

More than 100 people have passed through it without problem,"" he said. The engineer has since taken his FB account offline.

A young man thumped in the mouth by a city motorist in a fit of road rage has challenged his attacker to turn up at the police station where they can view CCTV footage of the incident which set off their row.

Peerakarn Aiyara said he and his wife were riding his black Scooby motorcycle in soi Onnut 17 in Suan Luang on Jan 17 when a white Honda cut in front of him.

He parked nearby Sam Yaek market to visit a convenience store. However, the Honda cut in front of him again as they both vied for a car park on the narrow two-lane road, forcing his wife to jump clear of the bike.

Far from apologising, a woman wearing green left the Honda and started berating them for their poor driving. Moments later, the male occupant of the Honda approached him and punched him in the mouth. Mr Peerakarn shared video footage of the incident online, though it does not include the assault.

""He accused me of grazing his car, but I said I didn't hit anyone. He challenged me to go to the police before the couple calmly drove away,"" he said.

Mr Peerakarn visited Klong Tan police to report what happened, and the local hospital to tend to his mouth wound. He said the other side failed to show at the station despite the dare. He said if he had really grazed their vehicle he was happy to take responsibility. If not, the driver should apologise for hitting him.

Krirkrit Kengma, a witness to the incident including the assault, said he had suggested the young man get the police, but the Honda driver took off first.

There’s little evidence to show that will change, even as the state pledges an equitable distribution of a limited supply that researchers say is nearly impossible to execute without accounting for these demographics. The already questionable success of asking its most skeptical and underserved communities for trust lies in incomplete state figures that show when race has been recorded, 71% of those vaccinated have been white. Whites account for less than half of COVID-19 hospitalizations, but make up 59% of health care workers prioritized in the first phase of distribution. Black and Latino workers make up nearly a third of the state’s health care workforce, but available statewide vaccine reporting shows less than 10% of those receiving shots are Black and barely 7% are Latino — a group for which as of Saturday, the state had no outreach plan available. In localities like Richmond and Hampton, Black residents are three to four times more likely to be hospitalized than white patients.

Experts in public health and medical ethics warn that while state health officials focus on other vaccination setbacks, among them another data gap, the outcome of overlooking the nearly 230,000 unreported vaccinations by race and ethnicity could prove Virginia’s most preventable and deadliest pandemic failure yet. “We always say, ‘that’s not who we are’ What happens is, that is who you are,” said Dr. Robert Winn, director of VCU Massey Center. “We’re uncomfortable with race, therefore we don’t get race collection of data. We’re uncomfortable with class, therefore we don’t get class data. … and we just pretend like that data would be great, but it doesn’t matter.” Winn added that recording race and ethnicity is the bare minimum, and more extensive understanding of communities requires information like income, access to food and housing and the neighborhood patients live in. Otherwise, Winn said, “We will never really actually know how we were making impacts.” Despite the gap, Virginia Department of Health spokesperson Erin Beard said the agency will not require vaccinators to report “some” demographics like race and ethnicity because it could prevent a provider from reporting a shot given, and that the more information needed to document a vaccine in the state’s tracking system, the more likely the vaccine can’t be reported.

Beard didn’t provide examples of that happening, but challenges in collecting this data partially exists because health care systems haven’t prioritized it. The VDH site notes that while not mandated, providers are asked to enter this data. Beard’s advice conflicts with guidance from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, which lists reporting race and ethnicity as a requirement, but doesn’t apply any downward pressure on states for not doing so. “VDH’s goal is to vaccinate as many people as possible, and we do not want to turn away any person because they did not provide supplementary data,” Beard said. The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, whose 110 hospitals have doled out more than 230,000 vaccines, did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether doctors are asking patients about race or ethnicity. Only 17 states in the U.S. are currently reporting vaccinations by race and ethnicity. Of those, Virginia is the second-worst at tracking this data. It trails only behind New York, which has 2.2 times the population and has administered half a million more doses.

North Carolina, which has administered nearly 150,000 more doses than Virginia, has reported all of its vaccinations by race and ethnicity as of Friday. When VDH released a wider range of race and ethnicity data on June 16, a media release said “it is important for the public to understand these health disparities so they can respond appropriately” and that statisticians with the Office of Health Equity would be using this data to “inform tracking and reporting guidelines” to be better prepared for similar crises in the future. The VDH could not provide those findings and how it adapted those recommendations to reporting race and ethnicity seven months later. Nakeina Douglas-Glenn, a VCU professor who has specialized in race and social equity for more than 15 years, said the lack of data collection shows why the mistrust in health care systems and government agencies is so ingrained: communities know they view race and ethnicity as an afterthought. So the conversation on trust is misguided, Douglas-Glenn said. “Because it puts the conversation back on the community to say ‘Once we sort of collectively decide that we trust the government, then we’re going to be able to open our doors to vaccines,’” Douglas-Glenn continued. “But what we’re all collectively seeing is that the vaccine is not on the other side of the door if we were to open it.”

Almost half of Black adults nationwide said they weren’t confident that vaccine distribution was taking the needs of Black people into account, according to a December poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation. More than a third of Hispanic adults said the same of Hispanics. Further undermining the progress of combating hesitancy in the vaccine, which is highest among Black and Latino communities, is how the VDH chose who to prioritize within each group, Douglas-Glenn said. Driving the priority lists is risk of exposure and the essential workers who Gov. Ralph Northam has said “keep our society functioning” in recent media briefings. Douglas-Glenn said the sentiment sounds more like an economic discussion than a prioritization of who’s most vulnerable. “We’re sort of targeting professions that can help us to do that,” Douglas-Glenn said. “But where do we place value? What does that mean for those who don’t necessarily move into these sort of dominant professions?” In phase two, first in line are police officers, firefighters and hazmat workers, The Census Bureau estimates the professions are more than 65% white. Cleaning staff, however, are not specifically outlined outside of those who work in hospitals. Further clarification is offered in federal guidance, but there’s no guarantee that cleaning staff are receiving vaccines at the same rate. At least 43% of this industry is Latino or an immigrant.

Farmworkers, who do not have paid sick leave, have wrestled with some of the largest COVID outbreaks in the U.S. and are mostly Latino, are listed as fourth in line in the second phase. About 40% of public transit workers are Black or Latino and over the age of 50. They’re ranked 7th. Meanwhile the limited vaccine supply has meant some teachers, who are third in line and headed into in-person learning, haven’t received their first dose. The process could take months. Dr. Danny Avula, the state’s vaccine distribution coordinator, said that while there are outlined priorities for phase two, the order is not super restrictive. He added that correctional facilities and homeless shelters, second in line for vaccines in phase two, skew toward non-white populations in low-income areas. “The logic and ethical framework that was used to build the tiering absolutely considered that,” Avula said. “But what it doesn’t fix is that there’s still going to be a lot of inherent resistance. … it’s not just a question of offering the vaccine, it’s simultaneously having to do all of that other education work and marketing and finding ambassadors who are going to get vaccinated.”

Vaccination demographics on the local level are not available to gauge if that work has been successful—“we should make that happen,” said Avula—and neither is a breakdown of who is receiving doses within each phase. Anecdotally, state officials say the vaccine uptake is highest in physicians, who average a yearly income of more than $200,000 in Virginia according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and are predominantly white. Among the most at-risk are nurses, according to an October report from the CDC. But while that industry is nearly 80% white in the U.S., more than 60% of nurses hospitalized with the virus were Black or Latino. For lower wage positions such as home health workers, who make less than $9 per hour, do not have paid sick leave or overtime pay and are mostly Black women, the vaccination rates fall to 20 to 30%. “It may be unintentional but the result in some areas especially Hampton Roads are that cities with more resources and more affluent neighborhoods are a little bit further along and more organized and leaving behind communities,” Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, said in a Tuesday health committee meeting.

Virginia Health Secretary Dan Carey told Price he expects a “dramatic improvement” over the next two weeks and assured that Virginia is “walking the walk” in getting vaccines to historically discriminated-against groups. The VDH has touted efforts to place equity at the forefront—more so than nearly all other states with as high of Black populations. But the last town halls were in the middle of December and are no longer posted on the VDH’s vaccine landing page as of Friday, along with any mention of race or mistrust. The majority of ongoing efforts that include Winn’s Friday conversations with Black faith leaders and prominent health officials do not explicitly include Latino and immigrant populations. Both navigate language barriers highlighted last week, when a translation error on the VDH’s website told Spanish readers for nearly a month that the vaccine wasn’t necessary. The error—in English the site said the vaccine wasn’t mandatory—was a result of the health agency’s reliance on Google Translate, which experts criticized and federal guidance advise not to use for vital information.","Holes in Va.’s race, ethnicity reporting for vaccines leave doubts about equitable distribution",dailyprogress.com
851,852,https://www.sundaynews.co.zw/comment-farewell-to-a-true-patriot/,"THE late Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Lieutenant-General (Rtd) Dr Sibusiso Moyo who passed on last week and was declared a national hero will forever be remembered for his contribution to the political, social and economic landscape in Zimbabwe before and after independence.

Dr Moyo, who was fondly referred to as SB, had won the hearts of Zimbabweans across the political divide since taking over as Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade at the dawn of the New Dispensation at the end of 2017. He was leading the country’s reengagement drive with the rest of the world, as pronounced by President Mnangagwa. A strategist, good speaker and straight talker, the late Minister was a darling to Zimbabweans from the ruling party and opposition political parties alike.

Those who worked with him during the liberation struggle described him as an open-minded, courageous and honest man whose determination to liberate the country saw him defy his parents’ earnest implorations to return home as they feared he would be killed in a foreign land.

Dr Moyo, who was among a group of about 400 pupils from Manama High School in Gwanda District, Matabeleland South, recruited by Zipra cadres, refused to board one of the buses sent by the Rhodesian government to ferry them back from Botswana. A priest from the Lutheran Church, who was sent by Dr Moyo’s parents to Francistown, Botswana, to fetch him and his peers, failed to convince them to return home. That was a clear sign of dedication and love for the motherland.

Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ) Commander Air Marshal Elson Moyo, last week told our sister paper Chronicle, how he and his late cousin, Dr Moyo, refused to be cowed into submission by the repressive Rhodesian government. Not even fervent pleas by their parents could stand in their way. Air Marshal Moyo said they had already agreed as a team comprising folks from their home village, Mberengwa, to proceed to Zambia for military training, “come thunder come lightning”.

“We were part of the Manama High School students who had successfully crossed into Botswana under the guidance of guerillas who were operating in the Gwanda area. Soon after we had arrived in Francistown, there was pressure, which was put on the Botswana government by the Smith regime to try and get the Manama students back.

“The Rhodesian government dispatched the buses and relatives to collect us from Francistown. SB and I, including others from our area in Mberengwa, sat down as a team and agreed that only one person was going to represent them. Since I was the most senior, I volunteered to go and meet Reverend Shiri who had been sent by our parents to come and collect us.

“The message that I gave Rev Shiri was that we are not returning home until after independence. It was not a question of being forced because those who did want to go to Zambia had an opportunity to get onto the buses and return home, and of course, a few offered to return. Most of the buses went back virtually empty.”

Umzingwane legislator and chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Defence, Home Affairs and Security Services, Brigadier- General (Rtd) Levy Mayihlome added that Cde SB was a fearless, hardworking and innovative soldier who never gave up on what he wanted to achieve.

“We worked together doing strategic planning for the Zimbabwe National Army and then he was Lieutenant-Colonel and being our leader. He was a person who would never give up no matter how difficult the situation was. He was a rare breed of military officers, a workaholic and fearless and would not allow any obstacle to stand his way. He was visible in whatever we did as military officers.”

Defence and War Veterans Affairs Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri, who is also Zanu PF national chairperson said President Mnangagwa and the party saw it fit to honour Lt-Gen Moyo as national hero for the contributions he made during the liberation struggle and after independence.

Cde Albert Nguluvhe, Zanu-PF Beitbridge East legislator, said Dr Moyo was his friend with whom he shared the same desk at Manama High School. He described him as a very intelligent and disciplined pupil.

“His death is coming as a shock and I have lost a good friend and a scholar and I was not surprised when he got his PhD. Even when he was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, he handled that ministry very well, particularly looking at his engagement and reengagement efforts.”",COMMENT: Farewell to a true patriot,www.sundaynews.co.zw

The new movie is centred around the brutality and discrimination most blacks and African people face in their host countries.

The movie which is currently streaming on Amazon prime, Pitching to Netflix, Hulu, Tubi, Google Play, Apple TV stars popular actors such as Alan Washnevsky who played the lead role in the 2016 Academy Award-nominated short film ‘Day One’; Desmond Wyte, Robert Dobson, Richard Fisk, Conor Mesh, Matthew May, Fais Ahmed, Tracy Noland amongst others.

Directed by Olive Eko who also played the lead role in the movie. The Cameroon-born Nigerian actor cum producer described her role in the movie as ‘challenging and quite interesting’ having worked mostly behind the scene as director and play writer.

In her post review, Eko detailed all the efforts and ideas that birthed the production of the thrilling movie, thus she said: “The movie Humanity is very close to me as I have watched people lose loved ones over little things.

“There are a lot of movies that are out there that caries almost the same message but my movie is centred around a young African family who moved from Nigeria to pursue their African dream but was faced with life-threatening events in their host country”.

The unprofessional act and special discrimination by some military forces especially the police force against black race have often been ignored until the last attack in the USA which led to the Black Lives Matter movement that received extraordinary support from people of all races—and has resonated around the world

“This particular story is being told because a lot of Africans have been victims of police brutality but most of the time, it never make the news.

“I have watched someone close to me go through the pain of losing loved ones in the hands of people who have been put there to protect them. Being an African and see discrimination everywhere you go because you don’t sound or look like the typical white Americans, ” she added.

Produced by faith productions; the movie is distributed globally across media platforms by Aflik Tv. It promises to be impactful and interesting, revealing some of the untold stories of injustice and discrimination most Africans go through in white-dominated countries.",Black Lives Matter: US based director Olive Eko debut thrilling movie 'Humanity',www.vanguardngr.com

855,856,https://www.dailyrepublic.com/all-dr-news/wires/san-diego-resumes-efforts-to-create-city-run-public-bank-the-san-diego-union-tribune/,"San Diego city leaders want to explore creating California’s first government-run public bank, which could loan out tens of millions of dollars in city reserves for projects related to affordable housing, climate change, social equity or other goals.

A supermajority of City Council members recently asked Mayor Todd Gloria to hire an economist to write a proposed business plan for a public bank to assess the feasibility of the proposal and evaluate any risks.

Because such a study was requested by six of nine council members, Independent Budget Analyst Andrea Tevlin has launched a separate analysis so she can help guide the council on the issue.

San Diego is joining Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and several other California cities that have begun analyzing the pros and cons of public banks since state legislation allowing the banks was approved in October 2019.

If approved, San Diego would launch its public bank with hundreds of millions of dollars from city reserves that it now keeps at Bank of America and US Bank.

Supporters say that by cutting out a commercial bank as the “middle man” in the process, the city could generate interest revenue as high as 20 percent from loans it would make.

The city now receives small interest payments from B of A — currently about 1 percent — and earns revenue of about 2.4 percent from cash transferred into the city treasurer’s “pooled investment fund.”

Just like a traditional bank, the city’s public bank could lend money in the form of property mortgages, capital needed for housing developments or loans to nonprofits and other businesses.

A public bank could make it easier for small businesses to get capital. The banks could also direct loans toward projects that address pressing needs, like bike lanes, solar panels and other “green” infrastructure.

In addition, a public bank could provide crucial start-up capital to local credit unions and neighborhood banks. That might make loans and other financial services more widely available, especially in low-income neighborhoods.

Critics say previous efforts to launch public banks across the nation have been plagued by large start-up costs, profits that don’t materialize for decades and even complete failures in some cases.

They also say public banks get mired in politics, with decisions on loans becoming political debates instead of sound financial evaluations.

San Diego first discussed a public bank last winter, but the COVID-19 pandemic put the issue on the backburner until this month, when six council members included funding for the feasibility study in their budget requests submitted to Tevlin.

Those council members are Joe LaCava, Jennifer Campbell, Stephen Whitburn, Monica Montgomery Steppe, Raul Campillo and Sean Elo-Rivera.

“The multi-fold benefits of creating a public bank, such as divesting from Wall Street and creating opportunities to fund our own public projects, are worth the investment in the development of a business plan,” Elo-Rivera said.

Montgomery Steppe said a public bank could create a positive shift in perspective.

“Unlike a privately owned bank, which prioritizes shareholder returns, public banks leverage their deposit base and lending power to benefit the public,” she said.

Local advocates, who have created a group called PublicBankSD, said Friday they are grateful for such strong support from the council.

“There is an incredible groundswell behind this now,” said Jeff Olson, a North Park resident spearheading the local effort.

The state Legislature is expected to consider a bill this spring that would provide more potential capital for public banks, Olson said.

At the federal level, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has proposed streamlining the approval of public banks, making it easier for them to get insured and cleared for lending.

And new San Diego County Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer has proposed creating a county public bank that would focus primarily on housing loans.

In the race to establish California’s first public bank, Olson said San Diego is probably behind Oakland, which received a private donation to pay for its business plan.

Only 10 California cities will be allowed to establish public banks under the 2019 pilot legislation, with a maximum of two banks opening per year until that total is reached.

If money for the feasibility study is included in the new city budget adopted this spring, San Diego could create its public bank by the end of 2021. The feasibility study is expected to cost between $100,000 and $300,000.",San Diego resumes efforts to create city-run public bank [The San Diego Union-Tribune],www.dailyrepublic.com

857,858,https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/canada-post-honours-black-communities-with-commemorative-stamps-1.5279693,"TORONTO -- Canada Post is honouring two small communities with deep connections to Black history with commemorative stamps.

Amber Valley, Alta. and Willow Grove, N.B. were both home to hundreds of African Americans who sought refuge in Canada while escaping violence and slavery in the U.S. more than 200 years ago.

Ralph Thomas, an 82-year-old historian and former resident of Willow Grove, said he is grateful to finally see Black settlers represented on postage stamps.

“It’s one of the biggest rewards we could ever receive because we haven’t had Black people on stamps in New Brunswick,” said Thomas.

Thomas is the program coordinator at the New Brunswick Black History Society who spent his childhood in Willow Grove, a community about a 30-minute drive east of Saint John. He says he knew many decedents of settlers.

“It was tough times growing up in Willow Grove in the ‘40s, but I couldn’t imagine what it was like for Black folks in the 1800s,” he said.

He says life for settlers was rough. He describes the land as once being wooded and almost uninhabitableunless they were given the proper tools to survive.

“You have to consider these settlers came here with almost nothing. Before they came to these parts, they were slaves,” said Thomas.

Despite being given land, Thomas says Black settlers started their lives from scratch in New Brunswick. They were not only unfamiliar with life in Canada, but they weren’t given the necessary tools needed to begin new lives.

Thomas credits Indigenous people with helping many of the Black settlers in Willow Grove by teaching them how to live off the land. This may have included hunting and gathering, according to Thomas.

“If it wasn’t for the First Nations, a lot of our people wouldn’t have survived,” he said.

New Brunswick’s stamp depicts a scene of two settlers, Eliza Taylor and Alex Diggs, both of whom were responsible for the early development of Willow Grove. Their image is accompanied by the HMS Regulus, the ship that carried liberated former slaves to Canada by way of Saint John, N.B. in 1815.

A total of 371 people arrived in New Brunswick at the time and 74 settled in Willow Grove, according to Thomas.

Thomas and his colleagues were consulted by Canada Post before creating the stamp’s design. What he is most happy about is that Canada Post chose “ordinary” people to represent the greater Willow Grove community.

“It does my heart so good to see that Canada Post recognized ordinary people of the community who struggled the same way as everybody else who came out of Willow Grove,” said Thomas.

“They weren’t heroes, they were general folks trying to survive,” he said.

Thomas hopes this stamp initiative helps inspire more stories of Black settlers taught in Canada’s schools.

“Our history is going to be lost if we don’t talk about it. We deliver tours to schools, but this history needs to be a part of the curriculum,” he said.

This marks the 13th year Canada Post has issued stamps for Black History Month. Stamps went on sale on Jan. 22.",Canada Post honours Black communities with commemorative stamps,www.ctvnews.ca

Environment Canada warns that snow is in the forecast for parts of Metro Vancouver, the Fraser Valley, Vancouver Island, the Sunshine Coast and the Central Coast.

The federal weather agency expects snowfall to begin on Saturday night and continue Sunday morning on Vancouver Island and in the southwest area of Metro Vancouver, including Richmond and Delta.

It says two to four centimetres of snow are forecast in Richmond and Delta, while on the island, amounts could range from two centimetres on the coasts to five to 10 centimetres inland.

By Sunday afternoon, the snow is expected to become mixed with rain in many areas.

Meanwhile periods of snow are anticipated Saturday night through Monday morning in the Fraser Valley, including Chilliwack and Hope, with the potential for significant snowfall Sunday night.

Environment Canada warns that wet and slushy snow may make for a messy commute in the valley Monday morning and power outages are also possible if heavy, wet snow accumulates on trees.

THPD later suspended Newman for six days — Jan. 5 to 7 and Jan. 11 to 13 — and required him to report for remedial supervision and additional training for six months regarding the expectations of supervisors.

Newman also is the Vigo County clerk, having been elected to his second term in November.

The newspaper's attempts to reach Newman and city Police Chief Shawn Keen on Saturday were not successful.

In a Jan. 4 letter of suspension, Assistant Chief Matt Carden said Newman was disciplined because his ""posts have negatively affected the public perception of the department.”

Some say those punishments aren't enough and that they've done little more than warn against lax privacy settings on personal Facebook pages.

Protesters on Saturday called for the city's police merit commission to take up a new investigation and override the punishments handed down by departmental leadership.

""We’re here because Brad Newman has proven himself to be a danger to this community, but the THPD doesn’t seem to care,"" said Dominique Morefield, an organizer with the Reform Movement of Terre Haute.

""They took away his pay for a few days, assigned him more training in social media, and put him back on the street with a gun and a badge. We need the merit commission to step in, protect the public welfare and review the department’s charade of a disciplinary investigation. We think the facts will clearly show that Brad Newman has got to go.""

Fellow organizer Emma Crossen said many have taken exception to the idea that Newman was misunderstood and didn't intend to insult anyone.

""He knew exactly how his posts were being read and he was proud of it,"" Crossen said. ""After he called for nuking China, someone asked him on Facebook to clarify: 'Are you really suggesting murdering millions of innocent men, women, and children?'

""And what did Newman say? 'Yes I am. Absolutely! Smoke 'em.' ... He’s a violent bigot who is used to acting with impunity,"" Crossen said.

The Greater Terre Haute branch of the NAACP announced on Friday it had endorsed Saturday's rally.

""The problem lies when the bad cops hide behind the brotherhood of the good cops, who don’t expose the bad cop, which makes all cops look bad,"" said branch President Sylvester Edwards.

""The solution to this issue must be solved by their union, the Fraternal Order of Police. They know who among their ranks are harming the image of the majority. Be it known and now be it resolved, the ball is in your court, good cops. Do the right thing,"" Edwards said in an emailed statement.

Sergeant Julie-Anne Newman said the driver was first spotted by police on Stud Road in Rowville about 3.30am.

She said police tried to intercept the SUV after it was identified the driver was of interest to police for an outstanding matter.

But the man failed to stop and sped off through a red light. Police deployed stop sticks on Stud Road near the intersection of Brady Road as they tried to bring the driver to a halt.

“Police lost sight of the vehicle before officers, who were attempting to locate the vehicle and travelling south on Stud Road, saw a flash in the distance,” Sergeant Newman said.

“The car was found crashed into a tree and on fire.”

Police pulled the driver from the burning car and provided first aid but the 43-year-old Maribyrnong man died at the scene.

Superintendent Helen Sattler said it was quite confronting and distressing for the officers first on the scene who tried to save the man.

“It is never a nice incident to attend to and they showed great courage in pulling the driver out of the car while it was on fire,” she said.

“We will be offering counselling to those members and also to the family of the deceased person if they so desire.”

Superintendent Sattler said it was not a pursuit but police followed the car from a distance “to see where it was going to end up”.

She said it was inappropriate to comment further on what caused the man to crash or if he was previously known to police as a report was being prepared for the coroner.

She said police deployed the stop sticks due to his erratic driving but there was nothing to indicate that it was a stolen car.

The roads surrounding the crash were cordoned off for about nine hours while Major Collision Investigation Unit detectives investigated the incident.

Professional Standards Command will oversee the investigation as is standard procedure when a death occurs following contact with police.

A report will also be prepared for the coroner.

Stud Road, Dandenong North between Heatherton Road and Mcfees Road was reopened about 12.45pm.

862,863,https://www.swtimes.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/21/covid-vaccine-takeaways-president-joe-bidens-executive-orders/4244590001/,"President Joe Biden hit the ground running on his first full day in office, signing 10 more executive orders as part of his administration’s nationwide strategy to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

Though some plans are contingent on the passage of the president’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, others will have an immediate impact on the nation's daily response to the virus.

Overall, public health experts said, they are thrilled to see science driving a cohesive national strategy.

“It’s about time,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean of Emory University School of Medicine. “We’re finally having federal leadership. ... This is actually what should have happened 400,000 deaths before.”

This is only the first step. Experts said these high-level directives will take time to become detailed actions.

“We have to start big picture and identify big problems, but implementing each of these is going to take a lot of work,” said Dr. Eric Toner, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “There are going to be challenges.”

What will be the hardest to implement, and what will have the most impact on the coronavirus pandemic? Here are some takeaways from experts.

Wednesday, Biden signed an executive order requiring masks and social distancing guidelines on federal property for the next 100 days to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This won't apply to many people as most Americans don't spend much of their time in federal buildings or on federal land. Biden extended the policy Thursday with another executive order requiring masks be worn in airports and certain modes of transportation such as planes, trains, maritime vessels and intercity buses.

That will have an immediate impact on the lives of Americans as most airports don't have firm policies on masks. Only airports in locations that have state or local mask requirements have the authority to cite, ticket or, in some cases, eject travelers who fail to comply.

Public health experts said face masks are an effective way to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Last fall, scientists said that if at least 95% of the population wore masks in public, it could save nearly 130,000 lives from the end of September 2020 through the end of February 2021, according to a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Medicine.

Del Rio said airlines have struggled to require passengers to wear masks on planes because there was no federal mandate. Masks became a point of political contention in the previous administration, he said, but Americans must comply with federal law.

One major question remains: How will this be enforced?

“We have to figure out who’s going to enforce that,” Toner said. “Is it going to be TSA? The flight crews? What do you do if someone doesn’t comply?”

Another executive order signed Thursday directs “a national strategy for safely reopening schools.” It includes requiring the Education and Health and Human Services departments to provide guidance on the safe reopening and operating of schools, child care providers and higher education institutions.

School reopening plans are a patchwork of in-person, virtual and hybrid classes that are different in each state and school district. More than half of U.S. students were enrolled in schools learning entirely virtually heading into the holiday break, according to Burbio, a company tracking schools' COVID-19 plans.

Toner said this is going to be one of the hardest policies to implement because not even public health experts have an idea on how this can be achieved.

“There isn’t a consensus among the experts about the right thing to do,” he said.

Health experts said masks, social distancing and practicing hand hygiene in schools will help lower risk of infection, but it has been up to schools to figure out how to put those recommendations into practice.

Cases among children remain lower than other age groups, but a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Jan. 13 found cases increasing since the summer.

More than 211,000 new child COVID-19 cases were reported last week, the highest weekly increase since the pandemic began, according to a report released by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association. As of Jan. 14, about 2.5 million children have been infected with COVID-19.

The federal government has very little authority over schools.

Every state is different, but local governments, school boards, teacher unions and parent organizations could all stand in the way of implementing federal recommendations.

“They can rule on guidance, but it’s going to be up to the states and local school boards to follow that guidance,” Toner said.

Officials from teachers unions suggest it would take more than vaccines to get students in classrooms. Melissa Cropper, president of the Ohio Federation of Teachers, said the vaccines are an important piece of the puzzle to get students in classrooms, but not the only piece.

She is ""concerned that in the rush to get kids back in schools,"" further relaxing of quarantine guidelines will lead to more cases in the state.

Another executive order Biden signed Thursday will restore full reimbursement to districts – up from 75% – to support safe school reopenings through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief fund.

Del Rio said this may determine whether or not schools decide to follow federal guidance on reopening.

“What do states respond to? States respond to something called money,” he said. “If there’s funding to help them open schools, they will open schools.”

Not enough: 100 million vaccines in 100 days

Biden promised to administer 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in the first 100 days of his presidency, something Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, reiterated Thursday on NBC News' ""Today.""

“We said 100 million doses in the first 100 days, and we’re going to stick to that plan,” she said.

Biden laid out four priorities to do so in a plan introduced last week: allow more people to be vaccinated; create more places for people to get vaccinated; mobilize more medical teams; and increase supply.

Public health experts said that’s doable; in fact, it’s already being done.

Del Rio said the country administers 800,000 to 1 million doses a day. At this pace, the USA may achieve herd immunity by the fall.

As of Thursday, 35.9 million doses had been distributed to states, and 16.5 million had been administered, according to the CDC.

To vaccinate the majority of the population by the summer, the United States would have to ramp up vaccinations to 2 million to 3 million per day.

Other Biden orders include invoking the Defense Production Act to accelerate manufacturing and delivery of pandemic supplies, directing new studies to identify COVID-19 treatments and establishing a COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force.

Experts said the country may not see the impact of these orders right away.

“The rest of these are going to take more time and so their impact will depend on how long it takes to be implemented and where we are in the pandemic at that time,” Toner said.

The total case count in Sebastian County is roughly 4.5% of Arkansas' 224,243 cases since the virus was first confirmed in the state March 11, 2020, Department of Health records show. It had the fifth-most cases in Arkansas behind Pulaski, Washington, Benton and Craighead counties.

Within those numbers, the county had 908 active cases and 181 deaths from the virus, according to the state health department.

""The truth is, there are a lot of cases that have gone undiagnosed because testing was not robust early in the pandemic, a lot of folks didn’t get tested, and there have been a lot of folks that are asymptomatic that haven’t been tested,"" said Dr. Lee Johnson, director of Sebastian County Emergency Management Service. ""I think everyone would agree that while 10,000 is certainly a nice round number to point to for documented cases, the number is probably truly a lot higher.”

The county cleared the benchmark during what Gov. Asa Hutchinson said would be ""a very difficult month"" for cases in the state due to gatherings at Christmas and New Year's Eve. As of Thursday, the state had 54,082 tentative cases since Dec. 31, according to the governor's office.

In Sebastian County, the spike was seen in hospitalizations that rose to around 140 between Baptist and Mercy hospitals in Fort Smith. That number has called to around 100, Johnson said.

While Johnson said he and other medical personnel in the county anticipated the spike, the capacity pushed them close to a point where they ""had to be creative"" when housing and caring for patients.

County Emergency Management Director Kendall Beam said this kind of spike in hospitalizations points to the need for vaccine administration. As of Thursday, 186,105 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had been given in the state, which has allowed the vaccine to be given to teachers, postal workers and grocery store employees.

County officials are in discussions with the city of Fort Smith about how the city — which holds roughly two-thirds of the county's population — can assist in vaccine distribution. Officials say these efforts could include communication to the public about who can get the vaccine and distribution logistics such as facilities and streamlining the process.

""The more vaccines we have in the arms, the quicker we get this COVID over with,"" Beam said.

In the meantime, Johnson is asking Sebastian County residents to continue to mind their distances and wear their masks.

""Until we have more vaccine coming in, it’s going to be a little bit of a challenge, lining people up and getting them vaccinated,"" Johnson said. ""I’m confident it’s going to improve over time.""

Beam said he believes the county has ""done very well"" in its mitigation efforts considering it has responded to COVID-19 for about 10 months.","Sebastian County passes 10,000 COVID-19 cases",www.swtimes.com
864,865,https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2021/01/u-va-community-discusses-capitol-storming-parallels-to-unite-the-right-rally,"Many student groups drew parallels between the Capitol insurrection and the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in Aug. 2017.

Following President Donald Trump’s incitement of an insurrection at the United States Capitol, community members reflected on how the havoc that the Unite the Right rally wreaked in Charlottesville nearly four years ago influenced these past few weeks.

On Jan. 6, a rally in favor of Trump gathered in front of the Capitol and later turned violent when thousands of its participants stormed the building, angered over Trump’s loss in the 2020 election. As the mob broke in, they wielded, among other symbols, Confederate flags — a scene resemblant of many other conservative centered events, but namely the Unite the Right rally of 2017 in Charlottesville.

Although Charlottesville was the “canary in the coal mine,” according to Jalane Schmidt, associate professor of religious studies, she wants to make it clear that Unite the Right didn’t permit the insurrection, but was rather a symptom of the white supremacy that permeates our society.

Schmidt, a scholar-activist in the Charlottesville area, said that looking at U.S. history, the insurrection was not unprecedented at all. During the post-Civil War Reconstruction era in New Orleans in 1874, Danville, Va. in 1883 and Wilmington, N.C. in 1898, there were examples of “white mobs” staging coups against progressive, biracial governments.

“I heard some people saying in a well-meaning kind of way that 'this just isn't America,' and it was the same kind of mentality after the Unite the Right rally here in Charlottesville,” she said. “But actually, it is. We warned people. We said, 'America, this is coming to you.'”

The Daily Progress reported Jan. 7 that local activists like Emily Gorcenski, who was pepper sprayed on Aug. 11, 2017 at the Unite the Right rally, “predicted” the insurrection.

“I think that what we have seen time and time again is people underestimating the capacity for violence,” Gorcenski said told The Daily Progress. “We saw this in Charlottesville three years ago, when people were saying, ‘Oh, this is just rhetoric; we can’t use this to deny the permit, we have to give them their right to free speech.’ I’m sorry, but these were people who were talking about coming in and cracking Black people’s skulls, and then they came in and they cracked Black people’s skulls.”

Even though activists like Schmidt and Gorcenski try to explain the sheer prevalence of what happened in Charlottesville, according to Schmidt, people continue to think that the Unite the Right rally was an anomalous event. But in reality, the concept of “armed, right wing vigilantes” in league with those in power was not new, she said, and the Capitol raid was just the latest episode of that.

Sarandon Elliott, vice chair of leadership development for the Black Student Alliance and a fourth-year College student, was “shocked and surprised” upon witnessing events unfold at the Unite the Right rally. However, as she watched the insurrection, she said she saw it coming.

Attendees at a BSA community discussion on Jan. 12 came to the same consensus, she said.

One of the first parallels both Elliott and Schmidt saw between the events 2017 and the Capitol was the performance and role of law enforcement. Schmidt said that University Police talked to the alt-right participants of the 2017 rally, knew about their next moves and did not intervene in the name of free speech. According to Elliott, police, not just in Charlottesville, are “embedded” in maintaining the same white supremacy that was present in both events.

Something that she saw in both 2017 and now is the “conscious choice” on behalf of those in power to allow the participants to have a presence to begin with.

“I think one of the major things that I saw was definitely how Charlottesville police and then Capitol police handled the situation,” Elliott said. “I wouldn’t use the term ineffective, because that implies that they didn’t do the actions that their jobs require, the actions being to protect and uphold white supremacy. I think they're really complacent. But again, it's not surprising.”

Some groups on Grounds, however, do not see the same connection between the Unite the Right rally and the Capitol insurrection. Sean Piwowar, a member of College Republicans and a third-year College student, said that an important distinction to make is who we attribute certain actions to.

While he said that the Unite the Right rally was clearly motivated by white supremacy, he argued that being in support of Trump does not automatically coincide with being one.

His main grievance with the Capitol insurrection was more so the precedent it set rather than the behaviors it potentially confirmed.

“The things that we see in those sorts of scenarios are very bad, and I don't like them,” Piwowar said. “Something that I really value is our constitutional system of government and the institutions that we have … and what’s really sad about the Capitol, is that it was undermining all this stuff with the election. Of course, it was a free election, but it was an actual attack on the symbol of the institution of our legislative, representative Republic.”

College Republicans member and first-year College student, Nickolaus Cabrera, feels that the “violence” at the Capitol was not reflective of what the Republican Party stands for. To him, the main connection between Unite the Right rallies and the Capitol, was the presence of “hate,” Confederate flags and the deaths and casualties that followed.

“It was very heartbreaking for me to see that. [It's] where all of our congressmen and women get together just to serve our nation, and it's not representative at all of what the GOP stands for,” Cabrera said. “We don't stand on violence and we don't tolerate it at all. Granted, we did see a lot of Trump 2020 flags there, and as a former Trump supporter, I definitely [don't] condone all the acts at the Capitol.”

However, to Schmidt, the storming of the Capitol is actually, more than anything, a representation of the right. A common cause holds true for each of these events, and it’s a fear of replacement by “undeserving others,” meaning minority demographic groups, immigrants, socialists, communists or any other people the right can “scapegoat,” she said.

Far-right symbols including Confederate flags and signs of anarchy, Nazism and white supremacy were seen at the Capitol insurrection. Extremist groups including the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters and the Proud Boys were also present. Near the Capitol building, nooses were spotted slung over mannequins and hanging from makeshift gallows.

To Charlottesville native Clio Schurtz, a first-year College student and member of the Young Democratic-Socialists of America, the types of people present at both the Unite the Right rally and Capitol insurrection are one and the same.

“They were both really sickening examples of how normalized the alt-right and white supremacist movements have become in the U.S.,” Schurtz said in an email to The Cavalier Daily. “I was really horrified by both events and the fact that the participating extremists felt comfortable being so violent.”

According to Schmidt, an attitude of complacency and compromise is what’s to blame for the continued actions of the participants. The old formula of civil discourse can no longer be followed if the people the left are ostensibly compromising with, believe conspiracy theories and don’t share the basis of facts, she said.

In describing the people who carried out these events, Schmidt referenced a quote by Maya Angelou that states, “when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.”

“Trump and his minions have been telling us for years who they are, and they've been acting on it, and we should not be so naive as to not take them at their word,” Schmidt said. “So, we need to think about that, being at U.Va., what does it mean to share a country with people who are impervious to logic.”

In the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, Charlottesville as a community has been on a “steep learning curve,” she said, in order to recognize the history of white supremacy in the area.

Recognizing this has allowed people to become more actively engaged in difficult conversations involving the history of white supremacy. The events led to a denouncement of local leadership and spurred the election of the city’s first Black female mayor — Nikuyah Walker. Local policies changed to increase public safety and have also permitted the removal of Confederate statues.

Because of the size of the Charlottesville community, Schmidt said that there have been more people who wanted to engage in having these “difficult conversations” even if it hasn’t always been “pretty.”

“I think there are things that other communities can probably learn from us, not that we're perfect by any means, but just in terms of our willingness to sit down with each other, really hash things out and tell some ugly truths,” Schmidt said. “I think there's something to be learned from what we've gone through, whether people or parts of the country wants to do that remains to be seen.”

Elliott sees the University response toward tackling issues, such as white supremacy, in Charlottesville as insufficient. University President Jim Ryan and other University administrators, she said, responded with a lack of substance, with Ryan’s response to the Black Lives Matter protests this summer. The University’s statements in the past, she said, not only gave the community low expectations to discuss events regarding such issues, but also insinuated that the University is “complacent” in white supremacy.

“Time and time again, [they] have been not quick to, not only really address and tackle these issues broadly, but also at the University,” Elliott said. “But again, I think the Black community at U.Va. is also not surprised about that. I know Jim Ryan talked a little bit at the Democracy Dialogue about what happened to Capitol Hill, and we're kind of like, what should we really expect from Jim Ryan? He's not quick to really talk about these issues, much less tackle the issues.”","U.Va. community discusses Capitol storming, parallels to Unite the Right rally",www.cavalierdaily.com
865,866,https://www.gulte.com/political-news/53734/mystery-illness-resurfaces-in-3rd-village-in-west-godavari-dist,"One other village in West Godavari district is struck by the mystery illness of which people in Eluru complained a month ago. Over 22 persons in Komirepalle of Denduluru Assembly constituency complained of seizures, falling unconscious and foaming at mouth.

This is the third place in the same district to be affected by the mystery illness after Eluru and Pulla village in Bhimadole mandal.

Last week, 29 villagers of Pulla were found to be affected with symptoms of the mystery illness. All the patients have recovered and no new cases were reported in the last two days.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary Aditya Nath Das said that the mysterious illness has been surfacing in villages around Eluru. In Komirepalle, the affected include 14 men and eight women. Ten of the affected persons are aged between 12 and 35 years while 12 of them are aged above 35 years.

Das said that the health department was taking the issue seriously and that teams arrived in village to take know the cause of the illness. “Samples have been collected but preliminary water sample results didn’t show much. Food samples and affected peoples’ samples were also taken for analysis,” he said.

Of the 22 affected in Komirepalle, 14 people were admitted in Eluru Hospital. Five of the patients recovered and were sent home. In many of the cases, the affected are losing consciousness for a brief period and recovering after being given saline, doctors said.

West Godavari collector Mutyala Raju said that the water samples collected from Pulla had the particles in desired limits. “The sample test results of food materials like rice, pulses, egg and meat are yet to be received. Samples are being taken from households, hotels nearby and Gundugolanu market for testing. Blood samples are also being collected from the patients,” the collector said.

Health Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas noted that the illness has been surfacing in limited areas of the affected villages this time unlike in Eluru where a larger area was affected.“If it is water contamination or food poisoning or air pollution, the entire village must be affected,” he said.

Meanwhile, around 7 ambulances and two medical camps have been set up, apart from deploying 10 doctors and 20 ANMs in Komirepalli.

After the Eluru incident, several science institutes analysed food samples from the town. AIIMS and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology found that pesticide particles could be the cause of the mystery illness. However, more research is required to know how these pesticide particles gained entry into the human body.

She just thinks its economy is ""on hold"" for now. Like many other business owners worldwide, Tilton, the owner of Fox and Hounds Salon, was forced to shift operations due to the pandemic and lost a chunk of revenue from a statewide shutdown and subsequent restrictions. But she is “absolutely” confident in downtown Bloomington’s capability of a smooth transition into a post-pandemic world. Melissa Hon, Bloomington’s economic and community development director, agreed with Tilton, but said “the recovery is probably not going to be overnight.” There have been plenty of grants and loans available for downtown businesses, but they can only reach those who are eligible. “I can’t say that it’s (grant funding) necessarily reaching everyone, but I think we’ve really made a very concerted effort to try to reach as much and as many as possible,” Hon said. Some grants and loans have several requirements to qualify, such as employing a certain number of people, having made a certain amount of money the prior year, or showing a large enough loss in revenue caused by the pandemic. Bloomington has awarded more than $420,000 from extra Community Development Block Grants made available through the federal CARES Act passed last March.

“With our grants … with even our round one and round two of funding, we’ve really tried to focus on those that were hit the hardest,” Hon said. “So, with the first round of grant funding that we did for small businesses here through the city, we rewarded $150,000 to businesses that were deemed non-essential, so those that were required to be closed, those were the ones that we rewarded first.” Illinois also has provided Business Interruption Grants — a $580 million program and the largest of its kind in the country — which derives from CARES Act funds. Twenty-nine of those totaling $510,000 went to Bloomington-Normal businesses in the first round this summer. Then there is the federal Paycheck Protection Program, which provides potentially fully-forgiven loans to businesses with fewer than 300 employees to be used to keep workers on payrolls and pay for rent and utilities. Specs Around Town, a boutique specializing in unique eyewear, received a PPP loan that has since been forgiven. It paid for “the everyday expenses that I wouldn’t have had the cash to do without any sales,” said owner Julie Kubsch. Kubsch attended a trade show in Munich in January 2020 to stock up on inventory for the year. But the items she ordered didn’t arrive for another three or four months — after Illinois entered a stay-at-home order that closed her business.

That sent her into somewhat of a “panic mode,” but she said it eventually “worked itself out,” and she didn’t need any funding other than the PPP loan. Your membership makes our reporting possible. {{featured_button_text}} Despite the possibility of grants and loans not reaching every business, Hon said she “believe(s)” that throughout 2020, downtown Bloomington “had 10 new businesses open.” She is aware of some businesses relocating from downtown to other parts of Bloomington, but is not aware of any permanently closing due to COVID-19. Once COVID vaccines become more widely distributed, economists expect growth to accelerate in the second half of the year as Americans unleash pent-up demand for travel, dining out and visiting movie theaters and concert halls. Retail sales have fallen for three straight months. Restrictions on restaurants, bars and some stores, along with a reluctance of most Americans to shop, travel and eat out, have led to sharp spending cutbacks. Revenue at restaurants and bars plunged 21% in 2020. The loss of so many jobs has meant hardship for millions of American households. In December, employers cut 140,000 positions, the first loss since April and the sixth straight month in which hiring has weakened. The unemployment rate remained stuck at a still-high 6.7%. Yet there are signs that the $900 billion federal aid package enacted late last month may have begun to cushion the damage, in large part thanks to $600 checks being sent to most adults. The government began distributing the payments at the end of last month.

“We do a pretty good job of tracking for downtown, but we don’t have a citywide registration process for businesses, so if they are closing, if they don’t specifically reach out, we may not know until we’re looking at food and beverage tax or something like that, that they were no longer open,” Hon said. Still, as downtown has kept afloat, there is effort to reinvigorate the “energy and vibrancy” of downtown, as Bloomington Mayor Tari Renner described it in his State of the City address Tuesday. Two new electronic signs, which Tilton helped establish, went up downtown shortly before the pandemic. “As soon as we can have things like First Friday and the farmers market and all those, those two electronic boards will be very, very important for letting people know what’s going on downtown,” Tilton said. The signs are positioned on the north and south ends of downtown for people driving from both directions to see. A gateway arch will also be installed on Center Street coming from the north end of downtown. The arch is currently in production. Tilton has been working with another business in her building, Inside Out Accessible Art, on painting alley art on their building at 200 W. Monroe St. and others.

“We see a potential for alley art throughout the downtown where people can come down and have well-lit, colorful alleyways, and some of that art has started,” Tilton said. “But we haven’t been able to get it off the ground because of COVID. That’s hopefully a project we can get, and then we can look to the DBA (Downtown Business Association) to support us.” Tilton’s husband, Tim Tilton, is the new president of the Downtown Business Association – a nonprofit organization representing downtown Bloomington businesses, property owners and residents. The DBA is currently in transition, as they reorganized the board of directors and “because of COVID, we’re just sort of being quiet and reevaluating what our role is,” Vicki Tilton said. The new board has had a couple of meetings, and Tilton hopes more ideas will come forth that will involve recruiting volunteers for First Fridays and other festivals, like Halloween trick-or-treating or Once Upon a Holiday. She added: “I hope we (DBA) can be just the head of an organizing group who can get those volunteers down here and we can get things done through volunteers to bring people downtown who might not normally come here.” What is Illinois known for?

870,871,https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/education/charlottesville-schools-look-north-for-model-to-shed-resource-officers/article_2f93250c-5dd0-11eb-8dd0-eb92c8017356.html,"A committee tasked with finding a replacement for the school resource officer program in Charlottesville City Schools has settled on a model used by the Toronto, Ontario, school division. The plan would replace police officers in schools with unarmed safety monitors, who are well-known adults from the community. Their task is to build relationships with students and monitor school grounds. The Toronto District School Board discussed the approach with Charlottesville residents in a virtual forum earlier this month. After the meeting, the committee decided to customize the Toronto model — a process that most likely will involve more community and student input — though no official vote has been taken. Eventually, the committee will recommend a new model to schools Superintendent Rosa Atkins, who will then make a recommendation to the School Board. “I think people really loved the relational nature of it,” division spokeswoman Beth Cheuk said of the Toronto approach. “The fact that it pulled from community leadership and really leveraged relationships.” Charlottesville and Albemarle County were part of a wave of school districts that ended the use of school resource officers last year amid widespread protests about policing and racial justice. SROs are law enforcement officers and typically employed by the police department.

The Albemarle County School Board reviewed information in August about a new “security paradigm” that could include the creation of an in-house school security program, hiring more mental health professionals and a new agreement with the county police department. The board and division staff said a new model would be considered as part of the budgeting process for the coming fiscal year. The Charlottesville School Board has not discussed school resource officers or a new safety and security model since it in June ended its 2016 Memorandum of Understanding with the Charlottesville Police Department. The School Board voted in September to convene the advisory committee, which first met early November Since then, the committee of Charlottesville teachers, parents, students, community members and law enforcement has grappled with whether and how to replace school resource officers. Over the course of seven meetings since November, the committee reviewed the role of police in schools, the pros and cons of SROs, survey data from students and staff, and how other school systems approach the issue, according to meeting minutes.

Complicating their efforts has been the lack of examples to turn to, said Kim Powell, the division’s assistant superintendent for finance and operations. “And the reality is I think Toronto is perhaps the furthest along in this journey and that’s why everyone else is pointing to them, because it’s a change that everybody’s undertaking at the same time,” Powell said. “… We always want to learn from others, and so when you’re all learning at the same time, it makes it hard.” Other school systems that have decided to remove SROs are also looking at the Toronto model. Those on the safety committee were never tasked to create their own model but rather to respond to division staff’s suggestions and examples. The meetings aren’t open to the public, and the division has provided presentations and minutes for each one. The panel will meet again Tuesday. Some community members have worried that the division would use SROs this school year or include them in a future model, and raised the issue at School Board meetings and at the community forum.

Neither the committee nor the division is planning to bring back school resource officers for this year or as part of the new model. Powell said at forum that it was difficult to find a city school system in the United States that did not use school resource officers or armed security personnel. Charlottesville has been looking at peer school systems for guidance. Toronto schools removed SROs in 2017; enough time to gather data about how the new approach is working. In the last three years, suspensions have dropped by 25% and expulsions are down by 50%, according to the district’s presentation, though officials weren’t certain about the correlation between that decline and the removal of SROs. The data is important to assuage concerns about not having officers in the schools, Powell said. “And that’s not a small number of people, necessarily,” Powell said. “They may not speak up as often or as loudly, but how do we get the understanding and confidence to where we would like it to be to move forward with this type of change?” Toronto’s decision to remove school resource officers followed a lengthy and in-depth review that sought to hear from thousands of students and community members about the officers’ presence in schools. That review was part of a broader push to better serve and support students who were persistently falling behind that included a committee to the principles of equity, human rights, anti-racism and anti-oppression.

As part of that approach, the district decided to focus on the 15% of high school students who said the officers made them uncomfortable, replacing the SROs with the safety monitors. Your subscription makes our reporting possible. {{featured_button_text}} “They’re the folks who if a phone goes missing in the morning, they’ve got it in their hands by the afternoon,” said Jim Spyropoulos, the district’s executive superintendent for human rights and Indigenous education. “Everybody knows them and they know everybody.” The district also added support for school administrators to deal with discipline and building relationships with students. Powell said the committee is hoping to make its recommendation to Atkins within the next month, which could brought to the School Board by March. The committee also wants to give the public a chance to weigh in before making a recommendation. Some Charlottesville schools staff members said they didn’t want to be without the officers and valued the relationships the SROs had with students. They are worried about responding to incidents that require law enforcement and losing a direct line to emergency services for health and safety crises, according to a November presentation. People at listening sessions were worried about building security, asked for more de-escalation training and wanted to see positive relationships prioritized in the new model.

Some students who participated in a survey said the officers’ presence made them feel safer, while others listed friends and trusted relationships with teachers as the top things that make them feel safest at school. “The School Resource Officers are straight up useless,” one student wrote. “I’ve never seen them doing anything productive, so like what’s the point of them even being there at school?” As it works to adapt the Toronto model, the committee is working to seek more input from students of color at CHS. In December, the Black Student Union at Charlottesville High School encouraged the committee to replace SROs with resources that will focus on the causes of behaviors and disciplinary challenges. Those resources would include more social workers and guidance counselors. “The Black Student Union has full confidence that this approach will create an environment that will help our students and will take a step in the right direction towards breaking the school-to-prison pipeline,” the group wrote in a statement.

Since the 2017-18 school year, SROs have made 37 arrests at CHS, Buford Middle and Walker Upper Elementary, according to data presented to the committee. Of those arrests, 48% of the students were Black boys and 21% were Black girls. Black students account for about 32% of the division’s student body. Half of those arrests ended with the student in court and with a record. Charges against Black boys were more likely to end up in court. The other option is for students to complete a diversion plan that keeps them from officially being charged. “That so many more offenses are being diverted when they’re coming out of schools indicates that the things that kids are getting arrested for in schools are things that they would likely not be on the street and are very low level in general offenses,” said Shannon Ellis, an attorney with Legal Aid Justice Center’s Youth Justice program. Ellis was one of the presenters at the Jan. 12 community forum. She said that diversion plans are only available to certain low-level offenses and to people with clean or close to clean records. About half of the arrests were related to assault charges and 10 were in connection with drug, alcohol or tobacco possession or distribution of marijuana. Black students made up about 60% of the assault arrests. Six of the seven arrests involving white students were related to possession or distribution.

In recent school climate surveys, 27% of CHS students and 32% of Buford students said they disagreed or strongly disagreed that an SRO at the school makes them feel safer. About 5% of CHS students and 7% of Buford students said they interacted with an officer once a week or daily. The division didn’t provide any other quantitative data to the committee about how SROs interacted with students at school. Powell said there initially was some urgency for the committee to figure out a short-term model to implement when students returned in-person this year. But the School Board’s delay of the start of in-person classes till at least March 8, gave the committee and division more time. Powell added that with the small numbers of students who would physically go to CHS and Buford Middle School as part of the new model for in-person classes, no SROs will be in the buildings this school year. “With the amount of time that we’re looking at that’s remaining in the school year, the best decision is to focus on the long term,” Powell said. Regardless of the use of school resource officers, the division still has to draft an MOU with the police department to outline their involvement in the schools, according to committee documents. State code requires schools and law enforcement work together in three areas: crimes that must be reported, threat assessment and crisis planning.",Charlottesville schools look north for model to shed resource officers,dailyprogress.com
871,872,https://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/129720.php,"Japan is considering using its national ID system for its coronavirus vaccine rollout program, hoping to avoid the pitfalls and confusion that was created when the government dispersed economic aid earlier in the pandemic.

Vaccinating the country's 125 million people has taken on a heightened sense of urgency as hospital officials have warned the medical system was near collapse and the nation prepares to host the Tokyo Summer Games this year. While Japan has kept its rates of COVID-19 relatively low compared with the Americas and Europe, it has seen a surge in the new year and is under its second state of emergency due to daily rises in cases.

To ensure a smooth rollout of vaccines, the government wants a more unified approach to vaccination distribution and will likely use the ""My Number"" ID system. That system is a 12-digit number issued to all citizens and residents of Japan, including foreign residents, used for taxes, social security and disaster situations.

Currently, vaccines are distributed differently in each municipality. Such disparities could cause confusion in rolling out the vaccines, which need to be taken twice within a certain period.

The government plans to start vaccinating medical workers from the end of February. From late March at the earliest, people 65 and older will receive the shots. People getting vaccines will take coupons from local municipal authorities to the vaccination sites, which are typically medical facilities near their homes.

The new system would be linked to the national ""My Number"" IDs and the vaccination coupons. Information about who took the vaccine in which places would be shared by municipalities across Japan. The government aims to start operating the system by the spring, when they expect mass inoculations to begin.",Japan rushes to deploy unified vaccination record system,newsonjapan.com

The BBC Three film, ‘DIY Trans Teens’, will publicise the work of a doctor who has been struck off in the UK and now operates an online firm overseas that offers gender-change drugs to people in the UK.

In December, the High Court said the effects of the drugs were unknown and may include long-term harm, meaning it was very unlikely that children could give informed consent to their use.

That ruling led to warnings that vulnerable youngsters will try to access hormone drugs online, potentially exposing themselves to lasting damage.

Despite such worries, the BBC is planning to screen the DIY trans film – showing how drugs are obtained online from abroad.

BBC publicity material for the show confirms it will offer examples of people obtaining unregulated drugs via the internet.

It says: ‘Trans activist Charlie Craggs meets trans teenagers who are getting unregulated hormones online and starting their own transitions without medical intervention.

‘Charlie meets a doctor who has been struck off in relation to her work with trans patients and a lawyer who is launching a case in the High Court on behalf of a 14-year-old who has been waiting over a year for his first appointment with the NHS.’

The doctor is understood to be Helen Webberley who runs a company called Gender GP, which uses a website outside the UK to offer hormone drugs to people in Britain.

Webberley’s medical licence has been suspended and in 2018 she was fined £12,000 for illegally providing healthcare services from her home in Wales.

The BBC had initially planned to start screening the DIY Trans Teens documentary on January 26.

All references to the show were removed from the Corporation’s website last week after attracting attention on social media.

However, a BBC spokesman said the programme will still go ahead in due course: ‘The programme isn’t finished yet so will air at a later date – the programme page and [transmission date] were taken down as a result of this.’",New BBC documentary reveals how children can buy sex-change drugs,www.dailymail.co.uk

Senators will be sworn in as jurors on Tuesday. But then House prosecutors, who are called managers, and Trump’s defense lawyers will draft briefs arguing their cases.

Trial presentations will begin the week of Feb. 8, said Schumer, D-N.Y.

Between now and then, Schumer said senators would consider Cabinet nominations and the COVID-19 relief legislation from President Joe Biden.

“We want to put this awful chapter in our nation’s history behind us,” Schumer said. “But healing and unity will only come if there is truth and accountability, and that is what this trial will provide.”

A group of bipartisan senators introduced a bill on Friday to award Officer Eugene Goodman, the Capitol Police officer who led rioters away from the Senate chamber on Jan. 6, with the Congressional Gold Medal.

Goodman went viral this month after a video showed him leading a pro-Trump mob away from the Senate floor during the deadly Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol, potentially saving lives.

In the video, Goodman pushes a member of the mob, a man wearing a black QAnon shirt later identified as Doug Jensen of Des Moines. As a result, Jensen chased Goodman, who led him and the mob away from the Senate floor. The mob followed him into a group of police in a back corridor outside the Senate.

The legislation (https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SIL21021.pdf), introduced by Sens. Chris Van Hollen, D-MD., Chris Coons, D-DE., Tom Tillis, R-N.C., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Ben Cardin, D-MD., acknowledges this heroic act.

“Officer Eugene Goodman’s selfless and quick-thinking actions doubtlessly saved lives and bought security personnel precious time to secure and ultimately evacuate the Senate before the armed mob breached the Chamber,” the legislation reads.

It continues, “By putting his own life on the line and successfully, single-handedly leading insurrectionists away from the floor of the Senate Chamber, Officer Eugene Goodman performed his duty to protect the Congress with distinction, and by his actions, Officer Goodman left an indelible mark on American history.”

The Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal are the highest civilian awards of the United States.

Similar legislation to award Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal was introduced in the House by three lawmakers last week.

In the wake of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, President Joe Biden is directing the federal government to focus on domestic violent extremism, including having the National Security Council build out its capability to counter domestic threats.

“The Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol and the tragic deaths and destruction that occurred underscored what we have long known,” Psaki said. “The rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and growing national security threat. The Biden administration will confront this threat with the necessary resources and resolve.”

The NSA will undertake a policy review, she said, to determine how the government can share information more effectively to address threats, support efforts to prevent radicalization and disrupt violent networks. She said this will complement work already underway among agencies

“We need to understand better its current extent and where there might be gaps,” she said.

She said the administration has also tasked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for a “comprehensive threat assessment” to help shape policies to address the rise of domestic violent extremism. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security will consult on that work.

In addition, Biden has asked all relevant federal departments and agencies to “enhance and accelerate” efforts to combat domestic violent extremism, Psaki said.

Psaki said the White House is committed to developing domestic violent extremism polices and strategies “based on facts, on objective and rigorous analysis and our respect for constitutionally protected free speech and activities.”

She did not elaborate on any potential policy proposals.

Pro-Trump rioters at the Capitol this month included organizers of Proud Boys, an extremist group with ties to white nationalism, as well as other far-right organizations.

The Biden administration doesn’t have a timeline for when the public might be able to access a national website or phone center to get a coronavirus vaccine, Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Friday.

But she noted that Jeff Zients, who helped get the Obamacare launch back on track in 2013, is coordinating Biden’s COVID-19 response.

“So we’re in very good hands,” Psaki said, “and they’re certainly committed to getting more information out in a more accessible way.”

Ron Klain, Biden’s chief of staff, said on MSNBC Thursday that the administration will try to build a “national resource” for federal vaccination centers.

Asked about that commitment, Psaki said the administration is eager to provide more public assistance.

“I know all members of my family are also asking the same question as I'm sure yours are,” she said. “The lack of information and the disinformation ... has created a great deal of confusion.”

Nearly six in 10 older Americans don’t know when or where they can get vaccinated, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report released Friday.

GOP Sen. Murkowski says she didn’t vote for Trump, won’t join Democratic Party

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she didn’t vote for Trump in the November election and instead wrote in another candidate.

Murkowski wouldn’t say who she wrote in, only telling reporters with a laugh that her candidate ""didn’t win.”

“I wrote someone in. I’ve kind of become fond of looking at individual candidates,” Murkowski said, adding she chose her own candidate because, “I don't want to accept the lesser of two evils.”

The Alaska Republican, a key swing vote in the Senate, said despite her conflicts with the former president, which drew his wrath and even threats of a primary challenge, she would remain in the Republican Party.

“That's a dream by some that that will not materialize,” Murkowski said of the notion of her joining the Democratic Party. “I can be very discouraged at times with things that go on in my own caucus, in my own party. I think each member feels that. But I have absolutely no desire to move over to the Democrat side of the aisle.”

She explained her thoughts on this after losing a primary challenge in 2010 and considerations to join the Libertarian Party. She later won her race in a remarkable write-in campaign.

“I can't be somebody that I'm not,” Murkowski said. “I said, ‘Thank you, but no, thank you.’ I don't fly a flag of convenience. And it's not who I am. It's not who I am.”

Senate confirms Lloyd Austin, making him the nation's first Black defense secretary

The Senate on Friday confirmed Lloyd Austin as the nation's first Black defense secretary, the second nominee of President Joe Biden to be confirmed by the chamber.

Austin is a retired four-star Army general who will be the first Black secretary of defense. He was the first Black general to command an Army division in combat and also the first to oversee an entire theater of operations as the commanding general of U.S. forces in Iraq.

Austin's confirmation process wasn't without bumps. Controversy flared over a law barring recently retired military officers from serving as the defense secretary, but top Democrats lined up behind Austin's nomination, citing the need for Biden to have his national security team in place after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. The law requires that troops be retired for seven years before taking the post.

The House passed a waiver from the law for Austin on Thursday afternoon, and the Senate followed suit shortly after.

Schumer says impeachment article coming to Senate on Monday

The impeachment article charging former President Donald Trump with inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol will be sent to the Senate on Monday, triggering the impeachment trial process, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced on the Senate floor Friday morning.

He said he had been in touch with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the timing of the article. The House impeached Trump for ""incitement of insurrection"" on Jan. 13.

Schumer said it was still unclear how long the trial will last and when it will begin in earnest, issues he is still discussing with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

""But make no mistake, a trial will be held in the United States Senate, and there will be a vote whether to convict the president,"" Schumer said.

Senate leaders continued Friday to negotiate the timing of the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, who has hired a lead defense lawyer to represent him.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., proposed Thursday to start the trial in February, after preliminary statements are filed by House prosecutors and Trump’s defense team. He argued the slight delay would offer time for Trump’s legal team to familiarize themselves with the case.

""At this time of strong political passions, Senate Republicans believe it is absolutely imperative that we do not allow a half-baked process to short-circuit the due process that former President Trump deserves or damage the Senate or the presidency,"" McConnell said in a statement.

Trump hired prominent South Carolina attorney Butch Bowers, who worked for the Justice Department during President George W. Bush’s administration, to represent him. A friend of Bowers, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told his colleagues about the hiring during a conference call Thursday.

""Solid guy,"" Graham said, adding that Bowers would act as the lead attorney on a Trump team that is still being put together.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office said it received McConnell's proposal, which aims to start the trial in the Senate chamber Feb. 13.

""We will review it and discuss it with him,"" said Schumer spokesman Justin Goodman.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she would send the article of impeachment to the Senate “soon.” Schumer, D-N.Y., said there will be a trial, but the timing is uncertain.

The House impeached Trump Jan. 13, charging him with inciting the insurrection at the Capitol a week earlier. The Senate will decide whether to convict him.

But the case raises numerous legal challenges, including whether a former president can be tried after he leaves office. The Senate must also decide whether to call witnesses or hear other evidence.

Biden to sign 2 more executive orders Friday, more Cabinet confirmations possible

WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden's second day in office was focused heavily on COVID-19.

Biden stressed science and unity in his first briefing on the COVID-19 pandemic Thursday, giving Americans the ""brutal truth"" about the challenges the nation faces before signing a series of executive orders aimed at combating the pandemic.

Takeaways from Biden's COVID-19 executive orders: Experts celebrate plan, warn 'a lot of work' is left

On his third day as president, Biden will launch another front in his battle against COVID-19 by taking steps to provide economic relief to Americans still reeling from the effects of the deadly pandemic.

Biden is set to sign two executive orders that will give low-income families easier access to federal nutrition and food assistance programs and start the process for requiring federal contractors to pay their workers a minimum wage of $15 per hour and give them emergency paid leave.

Also on Thursday, a few of of Biden's Cabinet picks cleared a few hurdles.

The House removed a roadblock to the confirmation of Lloyd Austin, Biden’s nominee to be defense secretary, granting Austin a waiver from a law barring recently retired military officers from serving as the defense secretary.

Additionally, Pete Buttigieg, Biden's nominee to the lead the Department of Transportation, met a favorable reception and drew praise from both sides of the aisle Thursday during his confirmation hearing.

877,878,https://www.dailyrepublic.com/all-dr-news/wires/the-transition-from-trump-to-biden-is-already-being-felt-in-san-diego-the-san-diego-union-tribune/,"It’s only been a few days, and already the official transition of power in Washington, D.C., has touched San Diego in concrete ways.

A flurry of executive orders from President Joe Biden’s first 24 hours in office has halted construction on border wall projects, pledged further protection for the county’s 27,000 DACA recipients, and frozen deportation orders for an unknown number of local migrants.

The immediate changes, if only temporary, mark the sharp ideological contrast between the Trump and Biden administrations, and are just the beginning of more drastic changes expected in the coming days and weeks.

Yet for most San Diegans, the real-world impacts of a Biden presidency will come after he builds his cabinet in Washington and empowers his high-level lieutenants to carry out an ambitious agenda nationwide.

The 110,000 active-duty military in San Diego, and thousands of other federal workers who oversee everything from the border to postal service to forest land to transportation and more, are used to the uncertainty that comes every four to eight years with a new boss in the White House.

“That is part of the nature of federal work,” said Casey Dominguez, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of San Diego. “Research shows that people who work in the federal bureaucracy take that in stride. It’s part of their professionalism to serve whatever president and whatever party by administering the laws of the U.S.”

The vast majority of the federal workforce is made up of career employees rather than political appointees, and changes in leadership at the local level likely won’t happen soon, if at all, according to federal officials in San Diego.

Here are some of the ways that San Diego may be — and already has been — directly impacted by the transition of power in the short term.

CourtsThe most notable immediate change in leadership in San Diego could be in the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

U.S. attorneys — there are 93 of them nationwide — are appointed by presidents and confirmed by the Senate. A new administration often means existing U.S. attorneys are replaced with temporary ones while new appointments are processed.

In the Southern District of California, which covers San Diego and Imperial counties, the prosecutorial office under Trump had largely been run by acting and interim U.S. attorneys. Trump’s official pick for U.S. attorney, Robert Brewer, only took office one year ago after a lengthy confirmation process. He intends to stay on unless told otherwise.

“Mr. Brewer would be honored to continue his service at the pleasure of the new administration and has no plans to resign at this time,” said U.S. Attorney spokesperson Kelly Thornton.

If Brewer is forced out, the second-in-command would be automatically promoted in an acting capacity under the Vacancies Reform Act. That would be Randy Grossman, a longtime colleague of Brewer’s in private practice. Grossman joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office in March.

The Department of Justice could also install an interim U.S. attorney of its choosing, an appointment that could be renewed until a Biden nominee is confirmed.

Such nominations may move quickly with Democrats newly in power.

White House Counsel Dana Remus has already asked Democratic senators in a letter to send their recommendations.

It is also up to Biden to fill five vacancies on the San Diego federal bench. Former President Donald Trump had put forth four candidates but their nominations expired earlier this month without any action by the 116th Congress. And a fifth spot is opening up with the retirement of U.S. District Judge Larry Burns, who is going on senior status and will hear a reduced caseload.

Biden could reconsider any of Trump’s prior nominees, none of which appear controversial.

Shireen Matthews — a former federal prosecutor, now a partner at the prestigious law firm Jones Day — is the only among the four who has appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She could hypothetically move through the confirmation process fastest. The other three are local federal prosecutors Adam Braverman and Michelle Pettit and defense attorney Knut Johnson.

Judicial nominees are traditionally vetted by local commissions set up by home state senators, who then pass the short list of names onto the White House.

Remus has also asked Democratic senators for a list of judicial recommendations, with a focus on “nominating individuals whose legal experiences have been historically underrepresented on the federal bench, including those who are public defenders, civil rights and legal aid attorneys, and those who represent Americans in every walk of life,” according to the Dec. 22 letter obtained by HuffPost.

Border and immigrationPerhaps the most visceral impact of the transition in San Diego is the idling of construction equipment at the border.

In an executive order on his first day in office, Biden paused all border wall projects until the contracts can be reviewed.

“Like every nation, the United States has a right and a duty to secure its borders and protect its people against threats. But building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution,” the order states. “It is a waste of money that diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security.”

The 14-miles of international border that begins at San Diego’s coast has already visibly transformed under Trump, with deteriorating landing-mat fencing replaced by two rows of taller steel bollards topped with metal plates.

The new order would appear to affect at least four projects locally.

Work had just begun on replacing the short stretch of mesh fencing at Friendship Park with the same new-style steel bollard barrier.

On the other end of the city, construction was well underway to extend the fence-line 3 miles through the rugged Otay Mountain Wilderness. Farther east, bollards were also going up near Campo, a project that has been the source of litigation by Kumeyaay tribal members.

Another project called for a 0.2-mile section of fence to cut across the Tijuana River channel west of the San Ysidro Port of Entry near Las Americas Premium Outlets and was still in the planning stages.

Biden’s order does make exceptions to the pause “for urgent measures needed to avert immediate physical dangers or where an exception is required to ensure that funds appropriated by the Congress fulfill their intended purpose.”

Biden has already started undoing many of the Trump administration’s signature policies involving immigration, changes that are being deeply felt in San Diego.

“The Biden administration has already set a very different tone on the issue of immigration; one that reinforces the very American idea that immigration is essential to who we are as a nation,” said Andrew Nietor, a local immigration attorney, in an email.

The official reinstatement of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program that grants work permits and temporary protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children — frequently referred to as “dreamers” — means that tens of thousands of San Diegans will feel more stability in their lives. But it’s still not a permanent congressional solution.

Biden’s immigration bill proposes allowing beneficiaries of the program to get green cards immediately and creating a path for their parents to stay, as well.

A new 100-day moratorium on most deportations is meant to give the administration a chance “to rebuild fair and effective asylum procedures that respect human rights and due process,” according to the White House.

Lawyers are still worried about what will happen to people already enrolled in the “Remain in Mexico” program. Though the Biden administration announced that no new asylum seekers would be added to the program, it has not taken action to help those from Latin America who were forced to wait in Mexico for their asylum cases to proceed in the United States.

“We’re all waiting on pins and needles to see what’s going to happen with them,” said Maria Chavez, a San Diego-based immigration attorney. “Based on DHS’s statement, it seems like they’re not going to be allowed in to resume proceedings any time soon, especially since the border is still closed to non-essential travel.”

EducationThe transition of power also means San Diego Unified School District needs to find a new superintendent.

Cindy Marten, who has headed the state’s second-largest district since 2013, has been tapped by the Biden administration to be the deputy secretary of education. She must first be confirmed by the Senate, which district officials expect will happen next month.

The San Diego Unified School Board chose Area Superintendent Lamont Jackson to replace Marten in the interim. The board said it will meet in the upcoming weeks to decide the process for hiring a permanent superintendent.

As for higher education, college students and grads took notice on Inauguration Day when the president announced that he was extending the date on which people will have to resume paying their federal student loans.

The deadline had been scheduled to expire at the end of the month, and the executive order extended it to Sept. 30. The pause was initially put in place last March, when the pandemic began to inflict widespread financial devastation.

Longer term, it’s possible that Biden will grant additional relief and assistance. He says he supports the idea of forgiving $10,000 or more of federally-backed student loan debt run up by individuals. But he has not committed to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ idea of making public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition free to families that earn less than $125,000 per year.

Future outlookLonger term, many San Diego leaders are optimistic that Biden’s support of science and environmental stewardship will result in major funding opportunities locally. But nothing is guaranteed, and much will rely on acts of Congress.

Having a Californian as vice president may also help bring additional attention to the region.

County officials and healthcare workers are encouraged by Biden’s COVID-19 strategy but are waiting to see if it will translate into increased vaccine production and distribution, as well as reimbursement to state and local jurisdictions for vaccine administration. The county is spending some $100 million on its vaccine sites.

San Diego, a mecca in biomedical research, could also be a major draw for federal grants.

Schools like UC San Diego and companies like Inovio are already developing and testing COVID-19 vaccines. And institutions like Scripps Research, the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, the Salk Institute and the J. Craig Venter Institute are involved in studying everything from the onset of cancer to fighting diabetes and communicable diseases.

The region also now has an opportunity to attract significant federal funding for new transit projects — including a $177 billion high-speed-rail network — if San Diegans are willing to pony up new tax dollars, said San Diego Association of Governments leader Hasan Ikhrata.

“No question,” Ikhrata said. “It will be easier with this administration than any other we’ve worked with. The opportunity is to really reimagine the future of transportation in the nation and in San Diego.”

Imperial Beach Mayor Serge Dedina has high hopes the Biden presidency will mark a turning point in the decades-long battle to clean up sewage pollution in the South Bay.

Trump’s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency made some efforts to address the flow of tainted water that flows over the border from Tijuana, but Dedina expects that a “more proactive engagement on the environment and with Mexico will be helpful.”

Kevin Strong of California was charged with three crimes related to the attack, including knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. He confessed to breaching the Capitol in an interview with investigators and was arrested on Friday, according to the Justice Department. Strong told law enforcement he hadn’t done any damage or attacked law enforcement, according to the affidavit.

Strong works for the Federal Aviation Administration and is a follower of the QAnon conspiracy movement, according to court documents. A day after the insurrection, an employee in the FAA’s internal investigation branch contacted the FBI and reported Strong to law enforcement.

Prosecutors say a tipster told the FBI that Strong has been “stockpiling items and telling others to get ready for martial law.” Based on that report, the FBI opened an investigation into Strong on December 30, according to the affidavit. The FBI says it searched Strong’s home on January 16 and seized two guns owned by Strong’s uncle and multiple digital devices, and that investigators found QAnon items during a search of his home.

Andrew Ericson of Oklahoma, 23, was charged with two misdemeanors related to the attack. Prosecutors say he live-streamed himself entering the Capitol, walking into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office and taking “what appeared to be a beer out of a refrigerator in an office,” according to someone identified in court documents as “Witness 1,” who watched the footage and recognized Ericson from a previous professional relationship.

Investigators say they tracked down Ericson after Witness 1 watched his livestream on Snapchat and provided his name to the FBI. Ericson was arrested Friday, according to an FBI affidavit and the Justice Department.

881,882,https://www.swtimes.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/22/lloyd-austin-becomes-nations-first-black-defense-secretary/6661471002/,"WASHINGTON – The Senate confirmed Lloyd Austin on Friday as the nation's first Black defense secretary, the second nominee of President Joe Biden to be confirmed by the chamber.

Austin is a retired four-star Army general. He was the first Black general to command an Army division in combat and the first to oversee an entire theater of operations as the commanding general of U.S. forces in Iraq.

Austin's confirmation process wasn't without bumps. Controversy flared over a law barring recently retired military officers from serving as defense secretary, but top Democrats lined up behind Austin's nomination, citing the need for Biden to have his national security team in place after the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6. The law requires that an officer be retired for seven years before taking the post.

The House passed a waiver from the law for Austin on Thursday afternoon, and the Senate followed suit shortly after.

Some lawmakers expressed concern about granting another waiver after they had done so for Trump’s first defense secretary. Jim Mattis, but they ultimately supported Austin.

Meet the Bidens: A who's who of the new first family

The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, said on the Senate floor that Austin is an ""exceptionally qualified leader"" who pledged to uphold civilian control of the military during his confirmation hearing.

The committee's top Republican, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, said he could not ""think of a better person to take the helm than Gen. Austin."" The waiver was ""overwhelmingly supported,"" Inhofe added.

Austin cleared the Senate in a 93-2 vote: Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Mike Lee of Utah voted against his confirmation.

Wednesday – hours after Biden was inaugurated as president – the Senate approved Avril Haines as the nation's intelligence chief. Haines, who served as the deputy director of the CIA, is the first woman to serve as director of national intelligence.

Haines will oversee 18 U.S. spy and law enforcement agencies – from the CIA and the FBI to nine units under the Pentagon's purview, including the newly added Space Force.

Among a host of Biden's Cabinet positions to approve, senators said, those dealing with the nation's security and intelligence would be prioritized. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday afternoon he hoped to vote on treasury secretary nominee Janet Yellen and secretary of state nominee Antony Blinken this week.

883,884,https://thenationonlineng.net/amanda-akunne-modelling-for-fashion-tv-was-awesome/,"Amanda Akunne is a model, beauty queen and the current Miss Aura International. In this interview with , she opens up on her experiences, memorable encounters, inspiration, travelling around the world as well as having her mum as her manager.

HOW did you emerge as the queen?

Let me say that among all the 50 delegates from Nigeria, I was picked to represent Nigeria in Turkey. You had different people submitting their details to apply for the pageant.

That was the COVID year, was it easy preparing for a pageant during the period?

I was prepared for it a year before that year. It was actually supposed to hold much earlier in April and then July. They kept shifting it.

How were you feeling with the postponement?

I was sad. I didn’t know if it will still hold because I have never had any opportunity to go for an international pageant before. Then I had my second experience and it was a very huge and I was super glad to be picked for it. When they started postponing it was as if this would let me down.

Just before this I had another international pageant which was in February in India. I was also Miss Talent there. It was when I got back that the whole lockdown started. I tried my best to reach out to people out there. People who didn’t have resources for things like hand sanitizers, face masks and food. I was able to reach out to People and assist them which was quite fulfilling.

The two pageants that you participated in were international pageants; COVID was out there, were you scared at all?

I recall that before I went to India the whole thing had not started at all. So, there was no fear at all. When I came back there was a lockdown and I had never experienced a lockdown in my life. I was nervous, don’t tell me that the world is about to end. You heard people dying here and there. It was happening more outside the country and I was really pretty scared. Even some of the stories were scary, that it came China, Asia and all that. I was scared but I told myself, Amanda you are not going to get this virus. My belief also was that one day we will actually find the cure.

What do you think gave you the edge over the others?

My first pageant was an African pageant, Miss African Golden and I emerged winner in 2019. I was really determined to go for that. Instead of going for Nigerian pageant, I wanted something bigger and better. I also wanted to mingle with other African countries. It was a very great experience and when I went into that. Then I took another step and went for Miss Super Model Glow. It was quite challenging because it was my first international pageant but I was able to achieve what I set out for. I was able to represent Nigeria, not just that. I was able to make Nigeria proud.

One thing that comes to mind is that anytime you travel out, you feel down because of the stories you hear about us.

So, every time I keep telling them about the good part of Nigeria and they usually want to hear more. I also like to inspire other girls out there and give them advice on how to discover their skills and talents. I also tell them from experience that whatever happens in a competition, never give up. Even if you do not win, stay focused.

That is what I always tell the girls. Interestingly, I came late to my second pageant because of flight delay. At that point, our border had not been opened and I was just praying. I almost lost it. You know, we had to do the COVID test before you travel and I didn’t even know where to do the test at first. So, I had to travel to Abuja and I did the first COVID test. They said it was late and I had to do it the day before I travel, then I had to do it again. All I wanted at that point was to travel and a very great experience and when I went into that. Then I took another step and went for Miss Super Model Glow. It was quite challenging because it was my first international pageant but I was able to achieve what I set out for. I was able to represent Nigeria, not just that. I was able to make Nigeria proud.

They said it was late and I had to do it the day before I travel, then I had to do it again. All I wanted at that point was to travel and compete. So, I was able to travel to Turkey. This time around I traveled alone because my mum couldn’t make it there.

What does it mean having your mum as your manager?

When your mum is your backbone, you will actually succeed. It’s quite a pleasure for me.She has been so supportive from day one. I started participating in pageants from school. I went to Chelsea Primary school and then went onto Navy Secondary school.

Is your father in the Navy?

No! But my mum wanted me to join the Navy because when you are in the military, there is some respect. One thing I like is the neatness and the white uniform. Its really attractive and I kept admiring them as a young girl. The cadet is so amazing, it was fun and my mum felt it will be powerful if a woman is in the military. Apart from that we are all girls in the family, four girls.

What are your memories of school days?

I had to cut my hair which was the rule and it actually took me days and weeks thinking about it. It was the first time I will ever cut my hair, right from childhood. When we go for competitions, the other girls did their hair. Everyone was always looking gorgeous with different hairstyles but we had no hair.

What made you stand out?

We were African queens. In addition, people always loved our uniforms. We were actually always winning our competitions, either first or second position. The Navy School is filled with intelligent people and I am proud that I am from that school.

Where did you go after Navy school?

I went to Afe Babalola University and studied International Relations. It was the first time I was going far away from home. My mum was worried, she couldn’t even come to my matriculation. I was sad initially but I just had to do my own thing.

What are some of the things that you share in common with your mum?

My Secrets! It’s with mum and never goes out. Also my relationships and people always say that we look alike.

What plans for the future? Are you thinking of being a female president someday?

Yes. You read my mind. I always see myself as a leader. And sometimes, I see myself as someone who wants to help the Nation. I want us to be on top. I want us to be great and powerful. I also realise that anytime I am out there people always look up to mme.I mentor mostly young girls, they usually ask a number of questions that inspires me.

Tell us about some of the memorable moments?

After the pageant, I got a contract on Fashion TV, Turkey and I was modelling for them. They also have a pageant called Miss Fashion TV and they are inviting me to another pageant soon. Hopefully, I will make Nigeria Proud again. While I was working with them, we had a house where I stayed with other models to learn more and associate with other girls. There were so many lessons to learn and it was a real learning curve for me. Along the line, I had a group of younger girls who were being bullied by the older ones. I told them to be strong, outspoken and never allow anyone to look down on them. It worked and everyone was happy.",AMANDA AKUNNE: Modelling for Fashion TV was awesome,thenationonlineng.net

It plans to be able to vaccinate 16 million people a month. The initial phase of inoculations will target

1.3 million health workers and 17.4 million public workers nationwide during the first quarter of 2021.

The country will offer free vaccines to people. With about 13,000 community health centres and 9,000 hospitals across the country, the government says it will be able complete its targeted vaccination to achieve mass immunity.

The world’s fourth most populous nation is banking on both Western and Chinese vaccines, ordering 125.5 million doses from Sinovac, 50 million from AstraZeneca Plc and another 50 million from Novavax Inc, while developing 57.6 million of its own Merah Putih.

It is now requesting 108 million free doses from the Gavi alliance, after previously saying it was seeking 54 million from the global vaccine facility.

Talks are also on with Pfizer Inc for 50 million doses and loaned cold storage facilities for the vaccine.

Joko got his first dose of the Sinovac shot on Jan 13 along with public and army representatives, which kicked off Indonesia’s inoculation programme.

Indonesia gave the first dose to 60,815 people in the first week of its mass inoculation drive. As of Friday, more than 132,000 healthcare workers had been given shots.

China’s Sinovac Biotech shipped three million doses of vaccines to the country in December; the local food and drug regulator approved them for emergency use this month.

Even before the regulator’s approval, the government started distributing the vaccines to its 34 provinces spread across the world’s largest archipelago.

Many hundreds of protesters participated in the toppling of the Colston statue, and then dragging it to the harbour before sending Colston to swim with the fishes – the same fate as that experienced by so many enslaved Africans on the transatlantic slaving ships, a business the slave-trader and former Tory MP Edward Colston, and others, got very rich from.

What’s On?

Initial plans by campaign organisers & supporters for a solidarity protest on 25th January outside Bristol Magistrates Court (Court info) have been scuppered by covid-19. The risk of infection; the high likelihood of dispersal orders and fixed penalty notices (£200) or arrests for supporters; and fines of upto £10,000.00 for identified organisers; and the subsequent media frenzy about ‘illegal’ protests would distract from the Defendant’s case – it should be noted this is just a Plea Hearing, where defendants plead Not Guilty, or Guilty, and if Not Guilty a Trial is expected to follow, possibly as far away as 2022?! So events have now moved online:

9.30-10.00am: see this FB eve – a 30minute teach-in & spoken words on a livestream, with an 8 minute silence at 9.45am to remember the 84,500 people whose kidnap and enslavement Colston helped to fund and organise during his time with the Royal Africa Company. As well as taking time to celebrate the enslaved whose many rebellions brought about abolition.



9.30am-10.00pm – please share solidarity photos and post to the FB Event or to your social media using #GladColstonsGone, saying why you’re glad Colston’s statue is no longer on our streets. And keep checking back for updates/more details. Feel free to drop banners, paint murals/slogans, go chalking, or just do your thing – DIY.



7-10pm: Livestream of local films via the Cube Cinema from 7-9pm, then panel discussion 9-10pm with Lawrence Hoo, Michael Jenkins and Rob Mitchell – chaired by Councillor Cleo Lake.

Info & tickets (free but donations to campaign welcome!) via Cube Cinema or BRHG.

Background: Campaigners in Bristol have spent years trying to tell the truth about Colston, his kind, and their murderous business practices. They have worked to bring an end to the continued memorialisation of Colston in Bristol – the statue, paintings & other monuments, buildings, schools, pubs, street names etc promoting his name are a continued expression of racist oppression & exploitation, perpetuated by Bristol’s white wealthy elites. Because of their classist and racist beliefs, Bristol’s elites, led by the Society of Merchant Venturers (articles), have resisted attempts at change & ignored factual challenges – being forced into only minor reforms & adjustments…although since 7th June Closton’s name has disappeared at a rapid rate! The protesters on 7th June clearly decided Colston’s towering racist presence could continue no more, and pulled him down. Well done we say – We All Did It!

Her white veil was found snagged on the door. An open bottle of water was leaking onto the tiles.

In the corner of the room was an ax.

Officers discovered the crime scene, described in court documents seen by CNN, at St. Pius X Convent Hostel in southern India on March 27, 1992.

Later that day, they found Sister Abhaya’s body in a nearby well at the Indian convent, in the city of Kottayam, Kerala.

A post-mortem examination revealed she had nail marks on both sides of her neck and two lacerated wounds on her head. Her body had multiple abrasions and she had sustained a fracture to her skull.

Despite her wounds and the kitchen crime scene, no one was brought to court over Sister Abhaya’s murder for 27 years. Instead, what followed was years of dead-end investigations, plagued with allegations of corruption.

Finally, last December, guilty verdicts were handed down to a priest and nun who had gone to extraordinary lengths to protect their illicit relationship. The court found Sister Abhaya had walked in on them while they were engaging a sex act in the kitchen, and killed her to conceal their sins. They were sentenced to life in prison.

After nearly three decades of fighting for justice, her family have one overriding question.

“Why did it take so long?” asks Sister Abhaya’s brother, Biju Thomas.

When she died, Sister Abhaya was a student at a local college run by the Knanaya Catholic Church in Kottayam, then home to about 1.8 million people.

Among India’s Hindu-majority population, 2.3% follow Christianity — a figure that hasn’t changed in more than two decades. But Kerala has a sizable Christian community, around 18% of its people.

According to India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which prosecuted the case, Sister Abhaya woke up at about 4:15am on the day of her murder to study for an exam.

She went to the ground floor kitchen to fetch some water and it was there prosecutors said she found Father Thomas Kottoor and Sister Sephy performing a sex act. Father Kottoor taught psychology at the school and Sister Sephy was in charge of the convent hostel where the act took place.

Prosecutors said the pair “maintained an illicit relationship”.

The night before the murder, prosecutors said the priest snuck onto the convent grounds and stayed in Sister Sephy’s room, which was on the ground floor of the hostel, near the kitchen.

When they realized the young nun had seen them in a compromising position, the pair hit her on the back of the head with a small ax kept in the kitchen, then threw her body into a well on the hostel grounds.

The details of what happened that night didn’t come to light until years later, after immense pressure from activists and the young nun’s family. Her father, in particular, refused to give up.

The first investigation into Sister Abhaya’s death was opened by the Kottayam West Police Crime Branch on the day her body was found. A year later, it concluded the cause of her death was suicide.

But Sister Abhaya’s father, Matthew Thomas, refused to accept their version of events and urged the CBI, the nation’s premier investigation agency, to take over the case.

They picked it up in 1993, but for 12 years did not charge anyone for her death. Instead, between 1993 and 2005, the CBI filed four reports, including three closure petitions, urging the Chief Judicial Magistrate to drop the case.

In their first report, they agreed with Kottayam police that the cause of death was “suicide by drowning.” However, it was not accepted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, and the case was reopened.

Their second report, published in 1996, was inconclusive — they could not determine if it was suicide or homicide. Investigators once again urged the case to be closed. This was once again rejected.

Their third report, published in 1999, stated it was a homicide but didn’t nominate any suspects. This was rejected as “unsatisfactory” by the Chief Judicial Magistrate.

Yet another report was filed in 2005, reiterating the case was “untraced,” as they could not identify any suspects. And once again, it was rejected by the Chief Judicial Magistrate.

After this, the investigation was transferred from the CBI New Delhi branch to the CBI in the southern city of Cochin in Kerala.

Finally, in 2009, the CBI formally charged Father Kottoor and Sister Sephy with murder, as well as another priest, Father Jose Poothrikkayil, who police said was involved in the killing.

All three denied the charge, as well as allegations of conducting an improper relationship.

They filed a dismissal request to get the case dropped, and it took another nine years before a judge ordered Father Kottoor and Sister Sephy to face trial. Charges against Father Poothrikkayil were dropped due to lack of evidence.

Prosecutors argued that Father Kottoor and Sister Sephy went to remarkable lengths to cover up their relationship and crime.

According to the CBI, Sister Sephy underwent hymenoplasty, a cosmetic fix to restore or reconstruct her hymen, the day before her arrest in 2008, to make it appear that she was still a virgin.

In court, prosecutors accused police officers from the Kottayam West Crime Branch of tampering with evidence and destroying documents crucial to the investigation.

“It is reasonable to suppose that Father Kottoor had at his control the immense resources of the diocese in terms of money and material, and could command the obedience of priests, nuns, and laymen,” the prosecution said.

Prosecutors alleged lead investigators, including the Superintendent and the Deputy Superintendent of the police, were instrumental in the cover up.

The judge agreed with the prosecution’s assertions that early police investigators fabricated and destroyed evidence, including the plastic bottle, Sister Abhaya’s slippers, and her white veil.

He ordered the state’s police head to ensure that “such misdeeds on the part of the police” do not occur in future.

Only one charge was made against an investigating officer, but that was dropped in 2008 after he died.

At least one other lead investigator from the Kottayam West Police Crime Branch, who was accused of fabricating and destroying evidence, also died before the case concluded.

“I have done no wrong. God is with me,” he told local reporters as he arrived in court on December 23 for the sentencing hearing.

His lawyer said the case relied entirely on circumstantial evidence. “There is no conclusive evidence,” said Father Kottoor’s lawyer, B. Sivdas. “And there was a delay in the investigation, a delay in finding the accused, there were so many loopholes. The court convicted them because the case became a sensation.”

Sister Abhaya — born Beena Thomas — was a “polite and quiet child,” according to her brother, Biju Thomas. They grew up in Kottayam, and were “devout Catholics and followers of Jesus Christ.”

“I remember when she was about five or six, she began taking a huge interest in God and the Bible,” said Thomas, now 51 and living in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. “She would read the Bible religiously, and take comfort in its teachings. Everyone loved her. She was always laughing.”

Sister Abhaya was 19 when she was “called to a religious life,” according to Thomas. The family had relatives in Germany and Italy who were also nuns. Thomas said that his sister admired the respect they received, and the work that they did.

“She wanted to be respected also, and devote her life to Jesus,” he said.

Thomas was 24 when he was told that his sister had died by suicide. “I was so confused because she was happy, and she was following her dream. Why would she have killed herself?” he said.

Thomas traveled back to Kottayam town, from the state of Gujarat where he was studying, to be with his family and take care of his sister’s funeral arrangements. Several days later, he visited her body in the morgue and read the postmortem report that revealed his sister had head injuries and nail marks to her neck.

“These to me showed that something had happened to her before she was thrown in the well,” he said.

Sister Sephy filed an eight-page written statement stating that Sister Abhaya suffered from “psychological depression.” She claimed that Sister Abhaya came from an “economically weak family and was not good enough in her studies.”

Some other nuns were “staunch upholders” of the suicide theory, according to the final judgment. They “endeavored to give all support to the accused,” the judgment said.

“It was very hurtful to hear those things said about my sister,” said Thomas. “She didn’t kill herself. She was silenced.”

Sister Abhaya’s father — a low-wage farmer — fought tooth and nail for his daughter, Thomas said.

“We were poor people, we didn’t have much money,” said Thomas. “But my father would travel for hours a day by bus to probe the police to reopen the case and give us the truth.”

“He suffered a lot,” said Thomas. “He always said ‘someone killed my Beena. I am sure of it’.”

Days after news broke of Sister Abhaya’s death, the suspicious nature of the case piqued the interest of a young activist, Jomon Puthenpurackal.

“When I heard details about (Sister Abhaya’s) case — the overturned fruit basket, the ax in the kitchen, her slippers in different positions — I knew immediately that something bad had happened to her,” said Puthenpurackal, who said he was inspired by Kottayam-based freedom fighter, K E Mammen, to “do good in the world.”

“I knew she hadn’t committed suicide, like the police and the Church said,” he said.

Puthenpurackal soon formed an Action Council to get justice for the murdered nun. He took a signed petition, along with Sister Abhaya’s father, to the CBI, detailing all the allegations of corruption and listing key witnesses.

Every time the CBI filed a petition to close the case, Puthenpurackal kept the pressure on, using the Indian media to keep the case in the public eye, and urging investigators to dig deeper.

There was one witness, in particular, who had testimony Puthenpurackal felt was key to convicting the case. Adacka Raju was a “thief by profession,” according to court documents. He had trespassed onto the hostel campus on the night of the murder to steal copper plates from the terrace, which he planned to sell, according to court documents.

Raju had stolen copper plates from the hostel twice before. But on his third attempt — the night of the murder — he told the court that he saw two men approaching the staircase. He identified one of them as Father Kottoor.

During the trial, defense lawyers vehemently argued against Raju’s version of events and sought to discredit him, by branding him untrustworthy and a “man of no integrity.” They also alleged that he was a witness planted by the prosecution.

The prosecution, however, said Raju was taken into custody by the Crime Branch and kept in the station for 58 days. He was subjected to “inhumane torture” by officers there, who tried to extract a confession to pin the murder on him.

“He stood his ground and did not budge even an inch,” according to the prosecution. “He was offered a substantial monetary reward and a job for his wife and the meeting of the educational expenses of his children and a house to live in, but he did not succumb to these blandishments.”

The police even arrested an acquaintance of Raju’s, and tortured him for two days, according to court documents seen by CNN. The judge stated that the acquaintance’s brother was also arrested and tortured for six days. He was repeatedly told to testify that Raju had committed Sister Abhaya’s murder.

“Raju faced many difficulties in coming forward,” said Puthenpurackal. “(The defense) completely dehumanized him. But he was one of the only witnesses who stood his ground, despite the mounting pressure.”

“I dedicated my life to this case and I wanted to see it through the end,” said Puthenpurackal, who continued to pursue the case even when it endangered his safety.

Father Kottoor threatened Puthenpurackal at a protest for Sister Abhaya. According to court documents, Father Kottoor warned Puthenpurackal that he would be “handled in the proper manner,” also pointing out that “no one working against the church had ever been spared.”

Because religious authorities in India are held in such high regard, victims often find it difficult to come forward if their perpetrators are involved with the church, according to the former president of the All India Catholic Union, John Dayal.

However, in recent years a number of victims in Kerala have come forward to seek justice.

In April 2019, Catholic Bishop Franco Mulakkal was charged with raping a nun multiple times between 2014 and 2016. A group of nuns who spoke against his alleged abuse claimed the church attempted to transfer them to other parts of the country, in a bid to silence them. Mulakkal, who is now based in the northern state of Punjab, has denied all allegations.

Former Catholic priest, Robin Vadakkumchery was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2019 for raping a 16-year-old girl in Kerala. The incident came to light only after the victim gave birth in February 2017.

The victim and her parents attempted to redirect focus away from the priest. Her father went as far as telling the court that he was the one who raped his daughter.

Sister Abhaya’s parents died in 2015, before their daughters’ attackers were brought to justice.

“I just wish my parents could have been here to see it happen,” said Thomas, Sister Abhaya’s brother. “That’s all they ever wanted.”

Thomas said he “can rest in peace” and move on with his life, now that the case is finally over.

However, he said he still struggles to reconcile his sister’s love for the church with the horror of what happened that night — and the fact that those who purported to share her faith were the ones who “took her away.”","She was murdered for catching an Indian priest and nun in a sex act.

889,890,https://www.1049thewolf.com/2021/01/21/local-covid-roundup-1-21-nearing-phase-4-requirements/,"PEORIA, Ill. — Region 2, the region that encompasses Peoria, Tazewell and Woodford counties, continues to make progress on a return to Phase 4 of Restore Illinois.

The only requirement the region has been missing is being below a rolling seven-day positivity rate of 6.5% for three consecutive days.

As of Thursday, the rate is at 6.6%.

The Peoria City/County Health Department Thursday reported two new area deaths due to COVID-19. Both were from Peoria County as a male in his 50s succumbed to the virus as well as a female in her 90s who resided at Sharon Elms.

Overall, 213 tri-county residents tested positive between Wednesday and Thursday.

99 new cases came up in Peoria County, 90 in Tazewell and 24 additional cases were added to Woodford.

Hospital capacity did decrease yet again in area hospitals.

Maybe they’d run out of meds, or wouldn’t have a record of my appointment, or maybe I’d be in for a three-hour wait, like a colleague who got her vaccination at Dodger Stadium Wednesday afternoon.

As I and others have noted, it’s been a rocky rollout, with mixed signals from political leaders, frozen appointment websites and plenty of confusion, especially among those 65 and older who were given the vaccination green light by Gov. Gavin Newsom way before there was enough vaccine to go around.

On Tuesday, after my column about being able to easily make an appointment in Alaska, but not here, I got an email from a reader telling me he had just signed up for a vaccine on the county’s VaccinateLACounty.com website. “Type fast,” he said. “Spaces are filling up fast!”

OK, I thought, here we go again.

I’d spent hours on the Kroger.com site trying unsuccessfully to get vaccinated at a Ralphs supermarket. Type in the location. Choose a store and check available vaccinations.

This store has the COVID shot but no appointments. That store has the shingles vaccine but not the stuff you need. And then you get stores where now you see it, now you don’t, as if they’ve run out of COVID vaccine in the 10 seconds since you last checked.

So you try again, and again. Burbank, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Pasadena, Woodland Hills. No luck. It’s like chasing a squirrel, and I think someone’s playing tricks on us seniors.

But things went differently for me on the county website Tuesday afternoon. I was already too late for quickly vanishing appointments at three locations. But readers had told me not to give up. Scramble, resubmit, keep hope alive. I tried my luck with the L.A. County Education Center location and presto!

I felt like I’d hit the lottery. See you Thursday, said my emailed confirmation, for a 12:15 Pfizer injection.

Quickly, I emailed some readers who’d written me about their frustration and told them to get on the site, ASAP. I retweeted the website and phone number, too. But before long I was hearing from readers who said they had tried, but were too late. New appointments keep opening up, though, so it’s worth continuing to try.

Still, we must, very soon, advance to where getting this shot in the arm doesn’t require having a computer, having the time and ability to negotiate website obstacle courses, and then being able to sprint to the finish line. This is crazy.

Speaking of the finish line, I figured something had gone wrong Thursday when I approached the Downey vaccination site. Cones were set up entering the grounds, but there was no line of cars. At the entrance, a county employee asked to see my ID and appointment notification, and I was directed through the chutes.

Employees from county health, fire and emergency services were all about, along with traffic controllers my age and older who told me they were volunteers.

Someone checked my temperature. My ID was checked again. And then a young woman, a traveling RN from Miami, approached me with a digital tablet and asked my name. I worried when she seemed to be searching in vain, but she explained there were lots of Lopezes with appointments.

She soon found my name and waved me ahead. Then a traveling nurse from New Orleans came toward me. Like the first nurse, she was smiling and in good spirits. We exchanged pleasantries, then she reached in through the window and needled me the juice. I didn’t feel a thing.

I said thank you, they gave me a vaccination card with my name and inoculation information on it, and I was directed ahead to a 15-minute waiting area to make sure I didn’t have a bad reaction.

First one nurse and then another came by to check on me. Then I was approached by Dr. Julie Lam, an internist at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center, who told me she was volunteering on her day off.

“This is my community,” she said when I asked why. “This is the first positive sign of hope.”

Some healthcare workers were being vaccinated at the Downey site, but Lam said she had seen “a ton of seniors” coming through the line.

“It’s a lot of people driving their parents and grandparents here, including some fragile 80- and 90-year-olds,” Lam said.

They’re the lucky ones, I said, given how hard it is to get an appointment.

“I’m one of the people who’s up at night trying to make an appointment for my family,” Lam said.

I mentioned that I might be back in three weeks, the recommended Pfizer follow-up time, for my second dose. I was surprised to hear her say that vaccine might or might not be available, and if it’s not, someone’s going to have to make some tough priority decisions. Should people be able to get a second dose before others can get their first?

L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger was surprised to hear that tidbit from me. She said she was under the impression that optimal effectiveness was based on getting the second dose at the prescribed time, and she thought patients were being slotted to return to the same place, same time, on the designated follow-up day.

“I’m going to follow up on that,” Barger said.

As for the glitches on the county website, Barger said she has heard firsthand about the struggles many seniors have experienced, and the county can and must do a better job of simplifying the process. But she added that the state has controlled that scheduling site and the state also controls the distribution of the vaccine.

In short, without more vaccine, it doesn’t matter how effective the websites are. Limited vaccine means limited appointments, and more mad scrambling for residents fearful of becoming sick or worse.

I’ve also fielded complaints from exasperated residents of Orange and San Bernardino counties, and from Kaiser patients, too, all of them wondering why seniors can’t get vaccination appointments more than a week after Newsom told them to roll up their sleeves.

The answer, Barger said, is that there simply hasn’t been enough vaccine available to meet demand. True, and until we get enough people vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, we still need to social distance and wear masks — even after getting the shot, since the vaccine isn’t 100% effective.

“I truly believe in my heart,” Barger said, that President Biden’s call for 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days of office is not an empty promise.

I hope she’s right. But if so, then we have to hope Newsom and the state do one heck of a lot better job managing the pandemic and distributing vaccine than they have to date, with reports that some of the coveted supply has sat on shelves and even expired.

My experience Thursday proves that we can administer vaccinations efficiently. But with more hospitalizations and deaths daily, we need to pick up the pace in a big way.

892,893,https://kvia.com/news/business-technology/2021/01/23/got-a-package-you-didnt-order-it-could-be-a-scam/,"Most people who buy things online just have to worry about their deliveries being delayed or never arriving. But some people are dealing with a different problem altogether: getting weird stuff like hair clippers, face creams and sunglasses they never even ordered at all.

The Federal Trade Commission and cyber experts have been warning consumers about these deliveries, which can be part of something known as “brushing” scams.

Here’s how these scams work: Third-party sellers on Amazon, eBay and other online marketplaces pay people to write fake, positive reviews about their products, or do it themselves. To be able to post the reviews, these so-called “brushers” need to trick the site into making it appear that a legitimate transaction took place. So they’ll use a fake account to place gift orders and address them to a random person whose name and address they find online. Then, instead of actually mailing the item for which they want to post a review, the brushers will send a cheap, often lightweight item that costs less to ship.

Sending an item (even the wrong one) creates a tracking number, and when the package is delivered, it enables brushers to write a verified review. If you’re on the receiving end, you usually aren’t charged for the purchase and your real account isn’t hacked — but you are left in the dark as to who is repeatedly sending the mystery packages. In many cases, there’s no return address. You don’t need to worry that anything bad has happened to you or will happen to you if you get a package that might be part of a brushing scam, experts say. But we all need to be concerned about the scams affecting reviews we rely on when buying products.

Brushing scams reportedly took off on e-commerce sites in China around five years ago. They resurfaced in headlines last summer, when all 50 states issued warnings about mysterious, unsolicited packages of seeds that people across the nation received in the mail.

But it’s not just seeds. Unsuspecting recipients have also found boxes with goods ranging from dog pooper-scoopers to power cords to soap dispensers on their doorsteps.

Jen Blinn of Thousand Oaks, California, told CNN Business she has been receiving random packages since June, including most recently a briefcase, a backpack, a hair straightener and a coffee-cup warmer.

“Every two weeks…I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered,” she said. Blinn notified Amazon of the issue, but a customer service agent “didn’t really understand what I was saying. She obviously didn’t know about it,” she said. The agent looked at Blinn’s account and found nothing wrong with it.

It’s not illegal to send customers unordered merchandise. But “the [Federal Trade Commission] has long gone after marketers that use fake reviews,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection and a law professor at Georgetown University.

Amazon says its policy prohibits sellers sending unsolicited merchandise to customers, and that sellers can be removed from the site for doing so.

“Third-party sellers are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to customers and we take action on those who violate our policies, including withholding payments, suspending or removing selling privileges, or working with law enforcement,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email. Amazon would not say how how many brushing scams have been found on the site or how many sellers have been removed due to these scams.

An eBay spokesperson said in an email that brushing schemes “do not appear to be highly prevalent” on the site. It violates eBay policy to send unsolicited merchandise to customers or falsify reviews and can result in eBay restricting sellers’ accounts or suspending them from the site.

Experts also say it’s difficult to quantify the frequency of such scams because it can be hard for companies to know whether reviews are fake, and scams often go unreported by consumers.

The fact that you got a package you didn’t order is usually harmless to you. The harm is to people who rely on reviews when deciding on a purchase, said Chris McCabe, a former policy enforcement investigator at Amazon tasked with stopping scams and fraud. He is now a consultant to sellers on the site.

“The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews, or this artificial padding of reviews, because they might see 100 positive reviews, and then there may only be 60 or 70 of them that are legitimate,” he said.

The likelihood that a consumer will buy a product that has five reviews is 270% higher than the likelihood they will buy a product with zero reviews, according to a 2017 report by Northwestern University’s Spiegel Research Center.

Some fake reviews are also being driven by Facebook groups where sellers offer buyers money if they write positive product reviews, said McCabe. Amazon and Facebook should work together to crack down on these groups, he said.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the company analyzes more than 10 million reviews every week to try to keep fake ones from being published and that it provides details of its investigations to social media companies “so they can stop these bad actors from abusing their platforms.”

A Facebook spokesperson said in an email that when the company is told of groups that may encourage fake reviews, it reviews them and removes them if they violate its policies.

For consumers, the unexpected deliveries can be jarring. The packages Ashanté Nicole never ordered started arriving at her home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 2019.

iPhone and portable car chargers. An iPad case. A heated shiatsu massage. A nail cleaning brush and a blow dryer. Sheets. A mattress cover. A floppy fish toy.

They didn’t have return addresses, so Nicole wasn’t sure who was sending the packages. She reached out to Amazon to try to stop them from coming, but they still keep arriving at her doorstep.

“It was just kind of a little bit concerning because I don’t know who has my information,” she said. “I don’t know what they’re going to send me. Like they could send something illegal and then I’m in trouble because I didn’t know whoever that person was or what they were sending me.”

If you get merchandise you didn’t order, it could mean that scammers have created an account in your name or taken over your account, an FTC spokesperson said in an email. Scammers may have even created new accounts in other names tied to your address, allowing them to post lots of seemingly-real reviews.

“We recommend keeping an eye on your online shopping accounts. If you spot activity that isn’t yours, report it to the site right away, and think about changing your password for that site,” the spokesperson said.

Nicole feels she has done all she can by alerting Amazon each time unsolicited packages from the retailer arrive at her doorstep.

“There’s literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn’t really done much,” she said.

Amazon declined to comment directly on Nicole and Blinn’s accounts, but said if a customer receives a package that was unsolicited, they should contact Amazon’s customer service team.

Nicole said she hopes Amazon will do more to stop brushing and ban sellers who participate in the scams.

“I just think they need to be a little bit more concerned with shutting those stores down and making sure those sellers can’t use the platform.”",Got a package you didn't order? It could be a scam,kvia.com

895,896,https://www.newdelhitimes.com/bus-heading-to-grand-canyon-rolls-over-1-dead-2-critical/,"A Las Vegas-based tour bus heading to the Grand Canyon rolled over in northwestern Arizona on Friday, killing one person and critically injuring two others, authorities said.

A spokeswoman for the Mohave County Sheriff’s Office said the cause of the Friday afternoon wreck was not yet known, but a fire official who responded said speed appeared to be a factor. No other vehicles were involved.

“It was a heavily damaged bus. He slid down the road quite a ways, so there was a lot of wreckage,” said Lake Mohave Ranchos Fire District Chief Tim Bonney. “Just to put it in perspective, on a scale of zero to 10, an eight.”

None of the passengers was ejected from the vehicle but they were all in shock, Bonney said.

“A lot of them were saying the bus driver was driving at a high rate of speed,” he said.

A photo from the sheriff’s office showed the bus on its side on a road that curves through Joshua trees with no snow or rain in the remote area.

There were 48 people on the bus, including the driver, authorities said. After the crash, 44 people were sent to Kingman Regional Medical Center, including two flown by medical helicopter, spokeswoman Teri Williams said. All the others were treated for minor injuries, she said.

Two people were critically injured, said Mohave County sheriff’s spokeswoman Anita Mortensen.

The bus was heading to Grand Canyon West, about 2 1/2 hours from Las Vegas and outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park. The tourist destination sits on the Hualapai reservation and is best known for the Skywalk, a glass bridge that juts out 70 feet (21 meters) from the canyon walls and gives visitors a view of the Colorado River 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) below.

Before the pandemic, about 1 million people a year visited Grand Canyon West, mostly through tours booked out of Las Vegas. The Hualapai reservation includes 108 miles (174 kilometers) of the Grand Canyon’s western rim.

In addition to the Skywalk, the tribe has helicopter tours on its land, horseback rides, a historic guano mine and a one-day whitewater rafting trip on the Colorado River. Rafters who are on trips through the Grand Canyon also can get on and off the river on the reservation.

In a statement issued late Friday, the Hualapai Tribe and its businesses said they were saddened by the rollover and that safety is the highest priority for guests, employees and vendors.

“As a people, our hearts go out to those so deeply affected,” the statement read. “We wish speedy recoveries to those requiring medical attention.”

National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway said he didn’t immediately have more details about the crash. The agency doesn’t send investigators to all bus crashes.

Other, deadly crashes have happened before in the area.

Four Chinese nationals died in 2016 when their van collided with a Dallas Cowboys staff bus headed to a preseason promotional stop in Las Vegas.

In 2009, a tour bus carrying Chinese nationals overturned on U.S. 93 near the Hoover Dam, killing several people and injuring others. The group was returning from a Grand Canyon trip.

Federal investigators cited driver inattention as the probable cause of that crash. The bus driver was attempting to fix a problem with airflow through his door before the crash and became distracted, then veered off the road and overcorrected before crossing a median and overturning. Most of the passengers were ejected.","Bus heading to Grand Canyon rolls over; 1 dead, 2 critical - - India's Only International Newspaper",www.newdelhitimes.com

Adam Kinzinger.

Austin Scott Davies, who runs Midwest Legal Care in Rockford, plans to ask his fellow Republicans to censure and disavow Kinzinger at the executive committee’s next meeting, Feb. 9.

In a draft resolution he shared with party leaders earlier this week, Davies states Kinzinger’s actions and statements regarding the results of the 2020 presidential election, the Jan. 6 attack on Capitol Hill and impeachment of former President Donald Trump are not in line with the beliefs and values of local Republicans.

Kinzinger was the first Republican House member to call for the invoking of the 25th Amendment of the Constitution and Trump's removal from office and was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump.

One of those Republicans, Liz Cheney of Wyoming, was censured by the Carbon County Republican Party earlier this week.

Kinzinger, R-Channahon, represents much of Winnebago County and a large curved swath of northern Illinois. Calls to Kinzinger's office Friday were not returned, but the following statement was shared Friday with Rich Miller at Capitol Fax:

""The Congressman, along with his team, has enjoyed a long relationship with the Winnebago County GOP. Congressman Kinzinger looks forward to building on that solid foundation as they work together to navigate these next four years under a Democrat majority and through the course of this pandemic, keeping the focus on serving the community and the shared interests of the party.""

A censure is nothing more than a public and formal disapproval of a public official, but the disavowal, Davies said, carries consequences.

Disavowal, he said, means Winnebago County Republicans would no longer support Kinzinger's candidacy or election to office.

""I've spoken with different party members who have support for the resolution,"" he said. ""A lot of Republicans I know are in favor of some kind of censure.""

Winnebago County GOP chairman Eli Nicolosi called Davies' resolution ""much ado about nothing.""

""Only one person speaks for the party in Winnebago County — the chairman, which is me,"" Nicolosi said. ""That's in our bylaws. Austin actually shouldn't be speaking to the media. ... He overstepped his bounds.""

Nicolosi said he's getting a lot of feedback from Republicans these days.

""Yes, there are a lot of people who are angry. ... There's a lot of frustration, for sure,"" he said. ""But, of course, there are a lot of people who want to move forward and not divide the party so the Democrats can prosper from this.""

In his proposed resolution, Davies also makes reference to suggestions that the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 was carried out by Black Lives Matter or antifa, claims that have been widely debunked. The FBI has also said there's no evidence antifa played a role in the riot.

Others are reading:The feds told Illinois to leave Rochelle Foods alone. Then a second COVID-19 outbreak hit.

The resolution also calls on Kinzinger to attend a future committee meeting “to explain his actions to this body, the Illinois GOP and the entirety of the concerned Illinois electorate.”

Davies, who is running for Rockford Township trustee this spring, said the executive committee, which is made up of selected precinct committee members, will determine his resolution's fate.

One option, he said, is for the executive committee to write a private censure letter to the congressman.

A vote by the county's GOP would take months of deliberation, Nicolosi said.

""It would go to committee,"" he said. ""It's something we would take pretty seriously. ... We have a whole committee that needs to weigh in, and not just one person.""

At this point, Nicolosi said, Davies' proposed resolution could be causing more harm than good.

""I think it's going to hit upon raw nerves,"" he said. ""Folks are naturally upset with the election, but the reality is, we have a new president now. We need to move on. We need to focus on local elections.""",This Illinois Republican wants Rep. Adam Kinzinger censured for his Trump impeachment vote,www.pjstar.com

“I do think it is a true increase based upon holiday travel, family travel, and things of that sort. And in my office, absolutely yes. We saw an increase in that same time frame,” pediatrician Dr. Deborah Greenhouse said.

South Carolina is one of two states that sets the cut off for a childhood case at age 20. Most other states define a child as someone younger than the age of 18 or 19.

According to Greenhouse, kids in elementary school or pre-kindergarten are less likely to spread the virus than older children, but all kids, on average, get less severely ill than adults.

“More common symptoms in young children with COVID are going to be more typical cold or flu symptoms: congestion, runny nose, cough. They may or may not have a fever. Fairly frequently, they will have gastrointestinal symptoms: vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain,” she explained. “The problem if you are thinking, ‘gosh it can be anything,’ yes it can be anything,” she added.

The virus can also infect any child at any age. Greenhouse said recently one of her colleagues cared for a mother, father, and newborn who all tested positive for the coronavirus.

898,899,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/267626251/democrats-start-reining-in-expectations-for-immigration-bill,"WASHINGTON - It's taken only days for Democrats gauging how far President Joe Biden's bold immigration proposal can go in Congress to acknowledge that if anything emerges, it will likely be significantly more modest.

As they brace to tackle a politically flammable issue that's resisted major congressional action since the 1980s, Democrats are using words like ""aspirational"" to describe Biden's plan and ""herculean"" to express the effort they'll need to prevail.

A cautious note came from the White House on Friday when press secretary Jen Psaki said the new administration views Biden's plan as a ""first step"" it hopes will be ""the basis"" of discussions in Congress. Democrats' measured tones underscore the fragile road they face on a paramount issue for their minority voters, progressives and activists.

Immigration proponents advocating an all-out fight say Democrats' new hold on the White House and Congress provides a major edge, but they concede they may have to accept less than total victory. Paving a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, the centerpiece of Biden's plan, is ""the stake at the summit of the mountain,"" Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigration group America's Voice, said in an interview. He said proponents might have to accept ""stepping stones"" along the way.

The citizenship process in Biden's plan would take as little as three years for some people, eight years for others. It would make it easier for certain workers to stay in the U.S. temporarily or permanently, provide development aid to Central American nations in hopes of reducing immigration and move toward bolstering border screening technology.

FILE - Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., speaks during a news conference about the ""Dream Act"" on Capitol Hill in Washington, Dec, 18, 2010.

No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Richard Durbin of Illinois said in an interview this week that the likeliest package to emerge would start with creating a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers. They are an estimated 1 million immigrants who've lived in the U.S. most of their lives after being brought here illegally as children.

More than 600,000 of them have temporary permission to live in the U.S. under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Former President Barack Obama created that program administratively, and Durbin and others want to protect it by enacting it into law.

Durbin, who called Biden's plan ""aspirational,"" said he'd push for as many other elements as possible, including more visas for agricultural workers and others.

""We understand the political reality of a 50-50 Senate, that any changes in immigration will require cooperation between the parties,"" said Durbin, who is on track to become Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. He said Senate legislation likely ""will not reach the same levels"" as Biden's proposal.

The Senate is split evenly between the two parties, with Vice President Kamala Harris tipping the chamber to Democrats with her tiebreaking vote. Even so, passing major legislation requires 60 votes to overcome filibusters, or endless procedural delays. That means 10 Republicans must join all 50 Democrats to enact an immigration measure, a tall order.

""Passing immigration reform through the Senate, particularly, is a herculean task,"" said Senator Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who will also play a lead role in the battle. He said Democrats ""will get it done"" but the effort will require negotiation.

Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who's worked with Democrats on past immigration efforts, said ""comprehensive immigration is going to be a tough sale"" this year.

""I think the space in a 50-50 Senate will be some kind of DACA deal,"" he said.

Illustrating the bargaining ahead, Senator Susan Collins, R-Maine, a moderate who's sought earlier immigration compromises, praised parts of Biden's plan but said she wanted changes, including more visas for the foreign workers her state's tourism industry uses heavily.

Democrats' hurdles are formidable. They have razor-thin majorities in a House and Senate where Republican support for easing immigration restrictions is usually scant. Acrid partisan relationships were intensified by former President Donald Trump's clamorous tenure. Biden will have to spend plenty of political capital and time on earlier, higher-priority bills battling the pandemic and bolstering the economy, leaving his future clout uncertain.

Democrats also must resolve tactical differences. Sharry said immigration groups prefer that Democrats push for the strongest possible bill without concessions to Republicans' demands, like boosting border security spending. He said hopes for a bipartisan breakthrough are ""a fool's errand"" because the GOP has largely opposed immigration overhauls for so long.

But prevailing without GOP votes would mean virtual unanimity among congressional Democrats, a huge challenge. It would also mean Democrats would have to eliminate the Senate filibuster, which they may not have the votes to do, or concoct other procedural routes around the 60-vote hurdle.

""I'm going to start negotiating"" with Republicans, Durbin said. He added that a bipartisan bill would be better ""if we can do it"" because it would improve chances for passage.

Democrats already face attacks from Republicans, eyeing next year's elections, on an issue that helped power Trump's 2016 victory by fortifying his support from many white voters.

Senator Rick Scott, R-Fla., who heads the Senate Republican campaign committee, said the measure would hurt ""hardworking Americans and the millions of immigrants working their way through the legal immigration process.""

Democrats say such allegations are false but say it's difficult to compose crisp, sound-bite responses on the complex issue. It requires having ""an adult conversation"" with voters, Representative Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., said in an interview.

""Yeah, this is about people, but it's about the economy,"" too, said Spanberger, a moderate from a district where farms and technology firms hire many immigrants.

899,900,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/story/2021-01-23/san-diego-womens-march-dives-deep-into-social-justice,"Relegated to the virtual realm, the 2021 version of San Diego-area Women’s Marches may not have made the same type of visual statement as tens of thousands of people marching together for a similar cause. But organizers believe the events’ ever-present mission to inspire community activism can be equal or greater this year.

That’s because the online events, streamed Saturday morning, provided a platform to discuss in a more meaningful manner matters of human rights, social justice and police reform.

“This really was a very different event. We have not had opportunities at the live marches to get into any particular issue with any measure of depth. Because at a march you’re doing two-minute, three-minute rah-rah-rahs,” said Poppy Fitch, a founding board member with the Women’s March San Diego organization. “Today what you saw was real talk, real conversation about real issues, getting at a greater depth of understanding, which is exactly what we’ve been looking for.”

The local movement, like others across the nation, first formed in response to the election of President Donald Trump. The San Diego chapter acts as an advocacy group, promoting everything from respect for women to immigrants’ rights to race and gender equality.

The first Women’s March San Diego, held the day after Trump’s inauguration in 2017, started at San Diego Civic Center Plaza in downtown San Diego and drew an estimated crowd of between 30,000 and 40,000 people. Marches in subsequent years started at Waterfront Park and also included thousands of participants.

This year, because of the pandemic, San Diego organizers knew they would need a new approach, one that inspired marching of a different variety.

“With COVID being what it was, we had decided very early last year, no in-person events for all of 2020. Yet we could not ignore the significance of what this year means, what this past election year means ... and really how far we’ve come as a movement, as an organization,” said Sarah Bacerra, a board member with the volunteer-led group. “We are still marching even if it looks a little differently.”

The team crafted a two-and-a-half hour, all-digital program that included pre-recorded messages from community leaders and activists, as well as live and recorded panel discussions all tailored around this year’s theme, “Breaking Barriers.”

The event was streamed on both YouTube and Facebook to a live audience of around 400 people, although organizers believe the activist-driven content will garner even more attention in the days and weeks ahead. Video messages from state Sen. Toni Atkins, San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria and City Councilmember Monica Montgomery Steppe celebrated the shattering of glass ceilings, noting the historic election of Vice President Kamala Harris, but challenged viewers to keep working for more change.

“Although there’s glass everywhere, we still have brick walls of inequity to dismantle,” Montgomery Steppe said.

Panel discussions invited speakers to expound on lessons learned during a year of upheaval.

“As a public health professional ... I experienced and witnessed the intersection between racism and health outcomes for many years, so it’s not new to me,” Leticia Cazares, a board member for the Southwestern Community College District, said during a session on maintaining social justice momentum during the pandemic. “I think now is when people are actually waking up, the general population, (with) COVID revealing the depth to which (systemic racism and policies) have impacted our communities for hundreds of years.”

Similarly, a virtual production put on by the North County San Diego Womxn’s March was dominated by expressions of hope, pain and unity. The self-described grassroots organization, which is independent from the national Women’s March group, was also focused on specific calls to action with host Venus Johnson urging guests to “make your ask.”

Sue Alderson, a North County organizer, talked about the need to “end period poverty,” referring to the difficulty that many women, especially low-income women, have in affording feminine hygiene products.

“It’s incumbent upon us that along with food, housing and diapers that we make sure that women who need hygienic products can get them,” Alderson said.

Tiffany Boyd-Hodgson, a board member of the Vallecitos Water District, said, “It is a question of dignity and enables women to fully participate in society.”

Gender equity also received a lot of attention during the North County event, with organizers stating that although transgender people have received more visibility in recent years, they still face inequality and discrimination.","San Diego Women's Marches move online, deeper into activism",www.sandiegouniontribune.com

905,906,https://www.sundaynews.co.zw/mambo-in-the-city-of-kings-asaph-speaks-on-sound-prayer-and-mama-nomination/,"Bruce Ndlovu, Sunday Life Reporter

 WHEN he began the long journey towards stardom, Asaph says he never looked for a sound that distinguishes him from other rappers in the country.

Before he was nominated for big award shows, when the red carpet he ever walked was the one in his parents’ living room, Asaph was also just another rapper in search of his true self.

After all, while life is hard for a musician in Bulawayo, it is even harder for a rapper. Not only do they have to battle for crumbs with artistes from other genres, they also have to deal with the fact that their craft is often looked down upon. Hip-hop does not tell the Zimbabwean story, some critics say, and if it does, it does not do so as eloquently or authentically as Zim dancehall, and its army of rough-around-the edges chanters, does.

That quality, that authenticity, which critics say is lacking in the genre, is thought to even more pronounced in Bulawayo, whose wordsmiths are sandwiched between chanters in Harare and the house music beat smiths in South Africa.

It is from this environment that Asaph emerged. Now, after serving hit after hit, he is one who has come closest to what can be described as Bulawayo’s own unique hip-hop sound, a sound capable of propelling hits to the top of the charts and make an entire nation pay attention.

During the week in which he was nominated for a prestigious MTV Africa Music Awards (MAMA) in the Listener’s Choice category, the rapper says the sound and style that has defined his success over the last few years was not by design.

“To be honest, if it was a situation like that, I wasn’t consciously doing it,” he told Sunday Life in an interview. “I was literally just making music with the beats I was given. I’m a person who works with the beat first, once I get an instrumental that I like then I build off of that. Was I purposely searching for a sound? Maybe there were certain songs that I thought get more of a reaction from people.”

As distinctive as his music sounds, the rapper also believes his growing catalogue of hits is as diverse as it is lyrically rich. While bombastic, confident Mambo might have put him on the map, he has not tried to follow its proven formula, with each subsequent hit following a different style and sound. Despite that, the music still sounds and feels like it was made in Bulawayo.

“I really like to believe that most of my releases are different from the last one. Mambo is different from Good Times anthem, like it is different from Like So and it’s different from Asiphel’ Moya. I guess I’m just doing me and it’s just who I am.

If I was raised by the city and influenced by the city then I guess the music will sound like the city. It’s something that we want but I don’t think I was consciously striving for it. I’m just making music. People love what they love and I’m glad they’re saying, ‘okay, this is starting to sound like Bulawayo’. I love it when they feel like we have found a signature sound,” he said.

For Asaph, the vote-based nomination for Mamas was a chance for him to prove the support that he truly has. Sure, he has heard them shout his name during shows and scream their lungs out as he hoists a gong in the air after success at yet another city award show, but how would he do when pitted against the likes of Winky D?

“For me this means I’m now on the African stage, know what I mean? I’m now an artiste who can compete on an African platform. Hopefully, this will come with a lot of recognition and doors to a lot of regional and continental collaborations. As for the support, I’m really chuffed by the way that people came out for me.

It was a voting on Twitter thing so the Twitter community of Zimbabwe, not only people in Bulawayo but the whole Twitter community that follows me, came out with support. Now this final push that’s where we need everyone to come through. This is now going to be a real test of the support base that I really have,” he said.

Last year was perhaps Asaph’s most successful year. His single, Like So, reintroduced Zim hip-hop to international channels like Channel O while Asipheli Moya spoke of not only his own resilience but the stubbornness of Zimbabweans surviving against the odds.

It was the kind of song that the critics say Zim hip hop does not create: heartfelt and honest while touching on the daily realities of fellow countrymen. It is therefore bittersweet for the rapper that he achieved success in a year devasted by a raging global pandemic.

“It was a pretty interesting year because even though there was the whole pandemic happening and everything, there were a lot of things that I seemed to be doing well in. There was a lot of good news coming from me. A lot of good songs were put out last year, a lot of big collaborations and in as far as performances, I felt the difference in the sense that I missed being on stage.

“As for the revenue, that’s where we had to get creative and find other ways to make sure that money continues flowing in. That came with collaborations and also social media work because there we a lot of people doing awareness campaigns for Covid-19 or whatever else awareness campaigns because everyone was now online.

So, it became a matter of who has the following, who has the numbers to push such campaigns. Revenue can be made but it is all about thinking outside the box and seeing how best you can navigate the terrain. As artistes, we shouldn’t just look at ourselves as performing artistes only. We can do much, we can influence and do a lot more,” he said.

Over the years, the most common advice for a talented young artiste looking to achieve success in the music industry has been that they should move to Harare if they want to fully realise their potential. Bulawayo has a ceiling, industry insiders usually tell young artistes, and once your head hits it, one has to move to a bigger market.

Given his success, some thought Asaph had become a big fish in a small pond and the rapper acknowledges that he might have been tempted to change cities at some point.

“I did have those feelings (of moving to Harare). There was a time when I felt that maybe if I was in Harare the bookings would come more frequently. I would be right there where the decisions are being made. I would be able to land more collaborations. I have always loved being in Bulawayo and going out there because it keeps you special. I don’t want to move to Harare and then it becomes like here because the more you grow, the space that you’re in becomes smaller as well.

“I can move to Harare and eventually in a year or two I would have collaborated with everyone and I would have performed everywhere and it would be the same situation as here.

 THREE people died after being swept away by flooded rivers following heavy rains and strong winds that battered parts of Chipinge District on Friday evening, the Civil Protection Unit (CPU) has confirmed.

Cyclone Eloise made a landfall in Mozambique on Friday before drifting towards eastern Zimbabwe and dumping a deluge over parts of the Eastern Highlands.

Chipinge District CPU chairperson, Mr William Mashava, said authorities were monitoring the situation.

“The first victim was found upstream of Bangazaan (Budzi) Dam. His body was discovered by children who were fishing. We are looking for his relatives after locals failed to identify him. The second victim was swept away along Chiriga River when he was returning from drinking beer with friends at night. Another victim was an elderly woman coming from a funeral in Musirizwi communal lands and attempted to cross a flooded river.”

The cyclone has reportedly caused extensive damage in some areas, according to CPU. By yesterday afternoon, 15 houses had been damaged in Gumiro Village, Mapungwana area in Ward 14. A science laboratory block was damaged at Mt Selinda High School, while toilets at Green Valley Primary School were destroyed.

There was also a mudslide between Chipinge and Tanganda, with large boulders blocking some roads.

There are fears dams such as Watershed, Bangazzan and Mutakura, which were already full before the heavy rains, could spill and cause flooding.

“Some houses collapsed in Ward 14 and our teams are making frantic efforts to reach the area to assess the situation on the ground. We are facing challenges because most of the areas are inaccessible,” he said.

Several evacuation centres have been set up in Chipinge to accommodate those affected by the cyclone.",Cyclone-induced floods claim three lives,www.sundaynews.co.zw

 THE public has been warned that the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic being experienced in Zimbabwe is far from reaching its peak, hence there are high chances that more positive cases and deaths will be recorded in the coming few weeks.

Mpilo hospital acting chief executive officer, Professor Solwayo Ngwenya, who has been vocal over the possibility of mass infections and deaths because of the relaxed approach by the public, said there was a lot of misinformation about the pandemic, hence there was a danger of more mass infections and deaths.

“A virus has stages from having cases then moving to deaths, it kills a lot of people before weakening and returning again in stronger waves. So, of this second wave, I am afraid but we are just at the beginning of a very terrible crisis, we are nowhere near what you call a peak.

“Further, we are not just talking of a second wave but there will be many waves to come of this pandemic, this virus will flatten a lot of us, it will come in different waves and each time the wave will be stronger and deadlier than the previous one. I said it in October (last year) that there will be more waves and different variants but people took Professor Solwayo Ngwenya for a fool, now look at what is happening,” said Prof Ngwenya.

He said the public was so relaxed that some people were seeking treatment late after relying on home remedies. Prof Ngwenya said this was part of the misinformation which was threatening to hinder the country’s fight against the pandemic.

“People also come late for treatment because there is stigma, people are hiding their results, some are opting for home remedies as a form of treatment and when they are about to collapse, they then come to hospital, with some dying on admission. What they do not realise is they have to check the amount of oxygen there is in their lungs and bodies before they steam. They should not think steaming is a remedy when they are about to die.

“There is a lot of misinformation regarding this coronavirus, some people even don’t believe that there is coronavirus, as I have said before there is need for urgent attention to this pandemic.

Coronavirus is a serious global emergency, it should show that we are in an emergency,” he said.

Prof Ngwenya decried the status of people living in rural areas saying their situation was unique such that they risked being exposed to the pandemic more and their figures not captured because of a poor data capturing system.

“People in rural areas are in trouble when they go to pick up food parcels, buy at the shops and even when boarding public transport. Further, their situation is peculiar because their accessibility to health care facilities is very limited,” he said.

Meanwhile, in the past week as of yesterday, the country had recorded a total of 4 126 new cases, a drop from the 6 382 new infections, which were recorded in the previous week. On deaths the country had 291 deaths which replaces the previous week as the bloodiest week in the country thus far. In the previous week 200 deaths were recorded.

Harare had the highest number of new infections last week which were pegged at 1 649. The country has now recorded 31 007 cases, 21 377 recoveries and 974 deaths since March last year.",‘Expect more Covid-19 cases and deaths’,www.sundaynews.co.zw

Two more infected persons were in La Trinidad town, in Benguet province, just south of Mountain province, and in Calamba town, an hour’s drive south of Manila.

Both have not travelled abroad and had no contact with anyone who tested positive for Covid-19.

Two more were overseas Filipino workers who returned from Lebanon on Dec 29.

They were taken to government-run quarantine facilities and had already been discharged after they tested negative.

The Philippines reported its first case of the new coronavirus variant on Jan 13 involving a 29-year-old real estate agent living in the capital who went to Dubai for business from Dec 27 to Jan 7.

He tested positive a day after arriving back in the Philippines from Dubai. He had travelled there with his girlfriend, who initially tested negative but was later found to be positive for Covid-19, although it was not yet ascertained if she had the same variant.

The variant – officially known as VUI-202012/01, or lineage B117 – is believed to be 70% more transmissible than previously circulating coronavirus variants.

 AS the nation continues to mourn the passing on of Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Lieutenant-General (Rtd) Dr Sibusiso Moyo (SB), Sunday News reproduces an article it carried in August 2015 as part of a series to commemorate the historic Manama Mission School mass recruitment of January 1977.

To many January 1977 may be dismissed as just one ordinary day in the calendar. Even a quick search on the Internet draws blanks on historic events that occurred on this day. However, for villagers in Manama, close to 90 kilometres from Gwanda town, this is a day which they can hardly forget as that was the day when their otherwise quiet and little-known village, made its way into the history books of the country’s liberation struggle.

This was the day that saw hundreds (about 400) of children being taken away from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Zimbabwe-owned Manama Mission and guided by just three Zipra guerrillas into neighbouring Botswana before they voluntarily flew to Zambia where they trained as freedom fighters.

Many have regarded the Manama Mission recruitment as the turning point of the armed struggle especially on the Zapu side as it saw thousands more Zimbabweans crossing over to Zambia to train as freedom fighters to help fight colonial bondage.

Among prominent figures that were recruited were the late Lt Gen (Rtd) Dr Moyo (SB), his cousin, Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ) Commander Air Marshal Elson Moyo, (former minister) Chiratidzo Mabuwa, Cde Mercy Sibanda the wife of the Commander Zimbabwe Defence Forces General Phillip Valerio Sibanda, Beitbridge East legislator Cde Albert Nguluvhe, former Zimbabwe International Trade Fair public relations manager Cde Cecilia Bhebhe, and many others.

Sunday News senior reporter, Vusumuzi Dube visited Manama Village to relive the events of that fateful day, catching up with some of the people who were part of the group that was taken and villagers who witnessed the landmark event.

Below are the accounts:

 Cde Lazarus Nyathi (55), who by then was just a 17-year-old Form Two pupil at the school, said that he was among the first pupils who were engaged by the three freedom fighters a few days before schools opened on 12 January, to gather intelligence on the school’s schedule.

He noted that he was too old to be in Form Two but had once stopped going to school due to lack of funds, hence he was more mature and was eager to join the armed struggle. Unlike the majority of those who were recruited, he was aware of the planned action.

“You should understand that a majority of the students at Manama then were not from this district but had come for the boarding facility but as for me I was a local, which is why I believe these freedom fighters approached me. One of them, Cde Moses Hawelo Mguni, was actually from this district hence he knew me.

“There were just three of them, Cde Mguni, Cde Mdubane Ndlovu and another whom I forget, although they constantly claimed they were more than three. They briefed us on their mission and because we were talking of crossing the border as well, we co-operated, kept it a secret to everyone and eagerly awaited their coming. You should note that most of us looked up to the likes of the late Cde Lookout Masuku who came from the district,” said Cde Nyathi.

He said on the day, which was a day after schools opened, they each wore two pairs of trousers and shirts as part of preparations for the long journey that lay before them.

“I remember they jumped the school fence when I was in my dormitory but since I was expecting them, I did not panic. They ordered everyone to gather at the school assembly point. Some pupils and teachers, however, hid behind desks, in toilets or ran but the majority of the school came along.

“Since it was the second day of school, the bursar had huge amounts of money for fees. I had not paid after lying that my father had not given me money. The freedom fighters took the money in cash boxes and loaded some of it into pillow cases. The few of us who had met them earlier were entrusted with keeping the money. I was carrying a heavy cash box filled with coins, which I half emptied into Thuli river as we crossed,” said Cde Nyathi.

When they crossed into Botswana, the three freedom fighters who took them “disappeared”. However, by now most of them were determined to embark on the journey hence very few escaped but the rest marched on, now being escorted by police officers from Botswana.

“Along the way we would encounter Rhodesian spotter planes but these three had taught us basic combat skills hence we would take cover when these planes passed above us. We knew what we wanted and that was to join the liberation war. It is for this reason that I usually do not call that event an abduction as when we crossed the Botswana border we were now walking alone, which is why when Ian Smith sent buses to ferry us back home, we all refused insisting that we wanted to go train as freedom fighters,” he said.

Subsequently, Cde Nyathi, whose war name was Cde Ishmael Tsuro, trained in Zambia before moving to Russia where he trained for one year and nine months before being deployed under the Zipra special services wing.

“Yes, some people refer to it as an abduction, but it should be noted that at some point we were walking alone without these three freedom fighters, the majority of us wanted to be guerrillas and that is what we became. Up to now, that event ranks as one of the events that saw the heating up of the war, as thousands took this incident as a cue to cross over and join the struggle,” said Cde Nyathi.

Halisupi Village head Mr Kabelo Nyathi, who by then was working at Manama Mission Hospital, and witnessed the incident, noted that villagers were in shock for a number of days after that. Rhodesian forces visited the area and harassed villagers for working with the freedom fighters.

“It was so sudden, one minute there was noise with dogs barking and the next thing we saw was a single file of all those students, teachers and some nurses walking past the hospital. We could do nothing but watch as everything unfolded. That was a very tense period. The following day the whole road from Thuli to Halisupi was littered with clothes, shoes, socks and food items.

Rhodesian forces harassed us for a number of days but what they did not appreciate was that none of us knew of the events leading to the day. Actually, to this day, I believe it is the students themselves who arranged the abduction because when buses were sent to collect them in Botswana they squarely refused to come back,” said Mr Nyathi.

Another villager, Cde Frank Dube, claimed he crossed to Zambia soon after the Manama incident, adding that this had encouraged him to join the struggle.

“It was unfortunate that I was not anywhere close to Manama when it happened but if I was around I would surely have joined them because during that period this is what everyone was talking about — joining the liberation struggle,” Cde Dube said.",SB Moyo and the Manama mass recruitment…A walk back into history,www.sundaynews.co.zw

916,917,https://www.dailyrepublic.com/all-dr-news/wires/state-nation-world/triumph-and-heartbreak-as-thousands-line-up-desperate-for-covid-19-vaccine/,"LOS ANGELES — Patricia Reber walked out of the vaccine clinic at L.A.’s Lincoln Park pumping her arms overhead like a champion. A friend told the 80-year-old she had waited four hours for a shot at Dodger Stadium, but Reber was in and out within 30 minutes.

“This was wonderful,” Reber said from beneath a Kobe Bryant face mask. “I think they’ve done the best they can with the lack of federal help.”

But in the chaotic rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine, the triumphs were matched by heartbreaking disappointments and confusion as older residents struggled with appointment websites that crashed because of huge demand while workers waited for official information that never came.

Aria Shafiee, 53, was almost in tears because her attempt to enter the vaccination site at Crenshaw Christian Center in South L.A. had been flatly denied. Shafiee knew she was younger than the 65-year minimum for vaccination under California’s rules but hoped she could get an exception due to her health.

“I have preexisting conditions,” she said. “I have diabetes, and my daughter is a resident at UCLA and she lives with us, and they still wouldn’t let me in.”

In the days since California opened up the vaccine beyond health care workers and first responders, there has been a deluge of people trying to get their shots that has overwhelmed supplies and left officials warning they could run out soon.

Health leaders in counties across the state say they are getting only a fraction of the vaccines they are requesting from the federal government, and that is going to leave those eager to get inoculated disappointed.

Los Angeles County, for example, needs more than 4 million doses to provide the two-dose vaccine protocol to all health care workers and residents 65 and older, but to date has received only 853,650 doses. San Francisco feared it could run out Thursday but was able to keep going at least for now.

Some areas are doing better than others.

The city of Long Beach was among the first to allow vaccinations of older people last week, and is now expanding its distribution to food workers.

Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia said a key decision made early on was not to plan out multiple days of vaccine distribution, but instead to vaccinate as many people as possible with the doses on hand. He acknowledged it is a riskier strategy because it can lead to the supply drying up.

“I said, ‘If we run out, that’s a good problem to have. Don’t be worried about running out. Be focused on getting as many doses out as possible,'” Garcia said. “I’ve been hearing about a lot of the horror stories in other places. That is not happening in Long Beach.”

Things have been less smooth in Los Angeles. On Thursday, the city became so overloaded that its vaccination registration website briefly shut down to new appointments.

Part of the confusion in Los Angeles began when the county said it could not move to residents 65 and older because it had not yet finished vaccinating some 500,000 health care workers who remain at the top of the priority list. After pushback, L.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis issued an executive order late Monday directing officials to move ahead with expansion.

California has 61 local health departments, all with different operations that are currently tracking vaccine data differently. The state is working on a data tracking system, but so far, without a comprehensive assessment of how many doses each county has been allocated, how many each has received and how many each has administered, it has been difficult to compare the progress at a county-by-county level.

According to the California Department of Public Health, providers reported administering nearly 1.6 million doses statewide as of Tuesday (reporting is delayed, the department said). More than 4.2 million doses had been shipped to local health departments and healthcare systems that have facilities in multiple counties.

San Francisco issued a new health order this week requiring providers to report how much vaccine they receive and administer. Local health officials throughout the state have complained they had no way of knowing how well their communities were being vaccinated because they lacked information from the providers.

The confusion led some, like 34-year-old Art Gamboa, to give up on official sources of information altogether and rely on word of mouth.

One of about a hundred people in a quickly moving line at Lincoln Park on Thursday, Gamboa, an in-home healthcare provider, said he first learned from a friend that he was eligible for the vaccine. He navigated a “not very well-made interface” online but was ultimately able to secure a next-day appointment, he said.

“It looks like a mess from the outside, but it’s actually moving pretty fast,” he said as more and more people queued up under the palm trees.

A few paces behind him, Joe Ford, 59, said that his employer told him he was eligible for the vaccine about three weeks ago, but that it took him a good deal of time to navigate the system and secure an appointment. Several locations in the appointment portal showed no availability until March.

A child and family services worker, Ford said he was “fortunate enough and privileged enough to have access to the web” to even make his appointment.

“I’m thinking about people here across the street who don’t even have a cellphone,” he said, motioning toward homeless encampments near the outskirts of the park. “It’s another area of our society that just points out the disadvantages for the marginalized folks in our community.”

Others, like Holo Au, took Gov. Gavin Newsom at his word when he announced that Californians 65 and older could get the vaccine. A retired postal worker, Au, 71, was wearing gloves, mask and shield for protection, and although he had a medical walker with a seat, the Lincoln Park line moved so quickly that he couldn’t rest for more than a few seconds at a time.

It took him about two days to get an appointment online, he said, and he was eager to do so.

“I want to protect myself,” Au said. “All year I stay home. I have nothing to do.”

Although Los Angeles is still technically working its way through seniors and healthcare workers, few in line at the Crenshaw Christian Center seemed to work in hospitals: chiropractors, in-home caregivers and nursing students were among those waiting for their shot.

Many said they had just learned they were eligible and came to the site at the first opportunity.

“I’ve just been waiting for my chance,” said Silvia Vasquez, 49, as she exited the outdoor lot with a bandage on her arm. Vasquez works as an in-home caregiver, she said, so she couldn’t rely on a hospital system employer to administer her vaccine.

A group of four chiropractors who work together were among those waiting. Beth Mulhall, 38, said it’s been a difficult year for their practice and their patients, particularly since they’ve had to reduce capacity and gauge who needs care most urgently.

Mulhall said that their boss was the one who notified them they were eligible for the vaccine, and that he championed them as “groundbreakers” for being among the first in L.A. to get it.

Her co-worker, Fabian Martin, said they were “more like guinea pigs.”

“The biggest fear is that it’s new,” Martin said, noting that while concerns about the vaccine’s safety crossed his mind several times, he ultimately decided to go through with it.

“However inconvenient it is to get here,” Mulhall chimed in, “it’s less inconvenient than being in a hospital dying.”

But several in line Wednesday weren’t health care workers at all. Two nannies, a teacher and even a marketing associate came to Crenshaw Christian Center because they had heard they might be able to get a vaccine if there were leftovers at the end of the day.

Max Costello, a 42-year-old house flipper, has multiple construction projects in the area and decided to try his luck. Several of his crew members have had Covid-19, he said, and it’s challenging to maintain social distancing at a construction site without keeping teams small. He found a place in the hot sun where he could wait it out and see.

But despite the abundance of “leftover shot” rumors floating around, guards at the site said they couldn’t confirm them. David Ortiz, a spokesman for the LAFD, said via phone that he didn’t think there would be any leftover vaccines, and that if there were, they would be taken to Dodger Stadium.

Still, the rumors were enough to bring Shafiee, the 53-year-old on the verge of tears, to the site. After her request for entry was denied, Shafiee said she wasn’t sure what to do next. Out of work for more than a year because of the pandemic, she had been hoping that receiving the vaccine would be the marker of better days to come.

As it stands, she and her husband have to wear face masks inside their Redondo Beach home whenever their daughter comes in from her job at the hospital.

“I’m very angry,” she said, wiping her eyes above her mask. “It’s an awful situation. . . . It has been a tough year.”

The city of Los Angeles is also offering the vaccine to anyone in Los Angeles County who is 65 or older, through a different online portal. That website connects patients to sites including Dodger Stadium, San Fernando Recreation Park, Lincoln Park, Hansen Dam and Crenshaw Christian Center.

Orange County residents can sign up using the Othena app. Information for Riverside County residents can be found at the Riverside University Health System, while San Bernardino County residents can find vaccine information on the county’s website. Ventura County is offering vaccinations to residents 75 and older, who can sign up for appointments online.","Triumph and heartbreak as thousands line up, desperate for Covid-19 vaccine",www.dailyrepublic.com

918,919,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/some-california-businesses-go-underground-during-lockdowns,"Ever since California went into lockdown to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19 last March, many of the state's ""non-essential"" businesses have taken their chances operating underground to try to stay above water.

Dozens of businesses in Los Angeles alone have been charged with violating Mayor Eric Garcetti's ""Safer at Home"" order.

Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer has charged dozens of businesses with violations, including car washes, tobacco shops, beauty supply stores, massage parlors, nail salons, pet groomers, and an Egyptian artifact store.

CALIFORNIA LOSES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS IN 2020

The owners of one Bay area massage business made the decision to reopen underground after 93 days on no income, telling Cal Matters that it came down to either paying ""the fine or we can’t pay our mortgage,”

Business owners who made the decision to go underground have turned to discreet measures to stay off the radar of authorities.

A California pet groomer told Politico in November that she meets clients in a back alley, then leads their dog through an entrance that reads ""closed due to coronavirus.""

A tattoo artist told Politico that he has reverted to appointment only in his parlor, and keeps the lights off and the curtains drawn when working with a client.

It's not just fines that these underground business owners face. The Los Angeles Mayor said in a recent ""Safer at Home"" decree that ""individuals, businesses, and properties which fail to comply with this Order may be subject to having their utility services shut off by the Department of Water and Power.""

Small businesses have received some help from the government.

The Treasury Department just revived the Paycheck Protection Program nearly half a year after funding first ended. Businesses with less than 300 employees that suffered at least a 25% drop in quarterly revenue can borrow up to $2 million, and the loans can be forgiven if 60% of the money is used for payroll.

That aid only went so far for many businesses though.

“That amount of money came in and covered the costs of one month,” the massage business owner told Cal Matters. “With the PPP loan, you had eight weeks that you had to use those funds for payroll and utilities… It looked like I gave myself a big raise, but it just kept me afloat for those months that I was behind.”

Gov. Tony Evers authorized the CARES Act funding for broadband expansion in September and the PSC awarded $5.3 million to 12 projects who applied for the funding in October.

""The need for broadband internet will not go away after the pandemic, but this funding is connecting folks to this critical service when they need it most,"" said Gov. Evers. ""The pandemic has shown us that broadband is not a luxury, it’s a necessity.""

In October 2020, the PSC voted 2-1 to approve 12 projects expanding high-speed broadband internet to underserved locations in Dodge, Fond du Lac, Jefferson and eight other counties. Grant recipients were required to submit to the PSC final reports of their projects by January 15, 2021, unless granted an extension.

According to the reports from awardees, these 12 broadband expansion projects exceeded the initial number of locations expected to be reached by the end of 2020, as they provided new or improved access to service for more than 20,000 homes, businesses, and farms across the state.

Since 2019, the PSC received more than $112 million in requests to fund broadband infrastructure through the state's broadband expansion grant program.

The 2019-2021 biennial budget, which Gov. Evers signed in 2019, allocated $48 million over the biennium for broadband expansion grants. While the Governor's original budget proposal included over $78 million for broadband, $48 million remains a historic investment.

In 2020, the PSC's State Broadband Office awarded 72 grants totaling $24 million to extend high-speed broadband internet access to as many as 3,182 businesses and 46,537 homes, including 39,778 locations currently unserved. The PSC is expected to award the remaining $24 million of the 2019-2021 biennial budget by the spring of 2021.

920,921,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-nimrods-made-with-local-contest-1.5885395,"At least two businesses in the Maritimes have had their online contests hijacked by scammers in the past week.

The businesses, Nimrods' restaurant in P.E.I. and the snack-food company Made with Local in Nova Scotia, are warning customers not to be fooled by scammers telling them they won a contest and asking them to provide personal information such as credit card numbers.

Nimrods' began a contest recently in conjunction with the Facebook group P.E.I. Good News Only. Facebook users would like and share a post, and be eligible to win a $100 gift certificate.

But soon afterward, people were notified by scammers with a fake Nimrods' account saying they had won, and linking to a page where they were asked to provide credit card information.

""We started receiving messages from people saying, 'Is this fake or is this real?' and so then we knew there was an issue,"" said Nimrods' co-owner Mikey Wasnidge.

Nimrods' and the administrator of P.E.I. Good News Only quickly posted a message warning of the scam.

Sheena Russell, who is from P.E.I. and founded Made with Local in Dartmouth in 2012, said something similar happened with her company last week.

Made with Local, a company that creates food bars and baking mixes using local ingredients, was running a giveaway on Instagram offering a one-year supply of food bars, worth about $600.

""About 24 hours in, we started seeing fake accounts trying to lure people in to entering their personal information in exchange for their prize, which is clearly not how this actually works, so that was pretty upsetting,"" Russell said.

Wasnidge and Russell said they would contact the winners privately or post the name of the winner, and not ask for personal information.

Neither business owner contacted the police about the scam, and say they are relieved that, to their knowledge, nobody lost any money.

However, they are disappointed and discouraged that someone would target their company that way.

""We spent most of the day on Friday talking to people about how this wasn't us and please don't click the link, like trying to essentially protect people from getting duped into this which you know definitely kind of take the fun out of what we were trying to do.""

Russell said they have run many contests in the past with no issues, but thinks the early success of the Instagram contest might have caught the attention of the scammers.

Wasnidge said it makes him wonder how far scammers are willing to go, and will make the company rethink how it does contests in the future.

""It's a little unnerving,"" he said. ""It kind of hurts us that people are using the name Nimrods', you know, taking advantage of the recognizability and the familiarity and the support that that name has, and using that to trick people and make money.""",'Upsetting' and 'unnerving': Maritime businesses warn of contest scam | News,www.cbc.ca

From email, SEO, and social media, to paid ads and websites, business owners have a variety. However, have you considered reaching your customers through one of the most used tools available? Consider using mobile phone texts, as the majority of the population owns a cellphone. SMS text marketing is among the many marketing strategies you can leverage for increased sales and business growth.

As the name suggests, SMS or Short Message Service marketing involves sending promotional and transactional text messages to previous and potential clients. There are now multiple SMS Marketing Platforms you can use. Messages could contain various time-bound offers, deals, or product updates. Any size business can benefit significantly from SMS marketing as it provides a direct avenue for business owners to reach their clients. However, ensure that you only send messages to individuals who have consented to receive them. Spam texts are damaging to your business brand and reputation.

Using this marketing strategy enables businesses to reach clients 24/7 and helps to build and maintain strong relationships. Before you send text messages to clients, ensure that you formulate an effective SMS marketing strategy to capture your business needs. Also, don’t limit your texts to business content only. Send your customers a happy anniversary or birthday message annually and simple greetings randomly.

Like any other marketing strategy, you should evaluate the effectiveness of SMS marketing before using it. The effectiveness of SMS marketing becomes apparent if your customers get the message and take action. That said, nearly everyone currently owns a phone. Approximately 4.78 billion people worldwide use mobile phones, with 3.5 billion using smartphones. This makes it easier than ever to reach customers through texts.

Unlike email marketing, where messages may be directed to spam folders, texts go straight into your customer’s inbox. Texts are also short and easy to read. Other reasons why SMS marketing is effective include:
• You can easily reach many people, especially when using a text message service provider.
• Mobile sent coupons have a higher redemption rate than coupons sent through other avenues.
• You can reach customers in areas with poor internet connectivity.

With the estimation that 3.8 billion people will have smartphones by the end of 2021, SMS marketing and SMS Marketing Platforms should be a consideration for your business.

SMS marketing and email marketing share several elements. For instance, you should get your customers’ contact information, create a contact list database, integrate SMS marketing service providers, create marketing content, and send the content to contacts and subgroups. However, telephone carriers can block your marketing efforts if you market incorrectly. To avoid this, observe the following marketing tips;

Ensure that your clients and target customers opt-in for SMS marketing. Otherwise, they can report your messages to carriers leading to carrier filters. This will mean you can not send messages to people using that carrier.

Use shortcodes — most SMS marketing tools send messages with a 10-digit number. However, such numbers are prone to be blocked by carrier filters unless your clients have opted in and your sender ID is whitelisted. Nonetheless, consider using apps that use shortcodes, usually between 5 and 6 numbers that are pre-approved by carriers.

Don’t only send offers — you should market your products and build a community with your clients. Offer valuable content, such as special discounts, deals, and educational content.

Keep your messages short — they should be easy to read and straightforward.

SMS marketing remains one of the underutilized marketing strategies. To reach a large audience, work with premium SMS marketing service providers. Such providers maximize the delivery of the messages while reducing lag time. This is crucial for businesses that need to update their clients on ongoing promotions in real-time, such as flash sales.",TECH TALK WITH MIKE: SMS marketing can improve business in 2021,www.goshennews.com
922,923,https://www.nola.com/opinions/stephanie_grace/article_031149f2-5cd9-11eb-a497-93f49fa7d216.html,"The candidacy of 5th Congressional District Republican Allen Guillory got off to an inauspicious start Wednesday, when he questioned an opponent’s very ability to serve.

The target of his obnoxious remark was Julia Letlow, a top University of Louisiana at Monroe administrator whose husband Luke was elected to the seat but died from COVID-19 complications days before he would have been sworn in, leaving her to care for their two young children without him.

“I asked her to please think about this,” Guillory told journalists covering qualifying. “Those kids could lose two parents.”

Those watching the busy political day unfold on split screen might have noticed that the scene unfolded around the time the nation’s first female vice president of the United States was being sworn in. And that Kamala Harris joins a new president who spent his formative years in the U.S. Senate as a single dad, taking the train home to Delaware each night to be with his young sons after they lost their mother and sister, suddenly and tragically. And maybe even that Joe Biden is accompanied at the White House by his wife Jill, who, like Julia Letlow, has earned the title of “Dr.” before her name.

All those steps forward, and still pushback.

Letlow, of course, can make her own decisions about what’s best for her family, thank you very much. When she showed up to file her papers the next day, she shrugged off suggestions to the contrary.

“I absolutely do not see it as a problem for raising kids, in fact, I think it’s a positive,” she said. “There’s no better example you can set for them, to see you in that role. ... And you know what? They’re going to be along for the ride, and they’re going to be better for it.”

That’s hopefully the last we’ll hear of any preconceptions about what a mother can and can’t — or should and shouldn’t — do.

But it shouldn’t be the end of the conversation about why these questions still come up. Could it be because politics is still so lopsidedly male?

It certainly is in Louisiana these days.

Fifteen years ago, the state’s governor and senior senator, Kathleen Blanco and Mary Landrieu, were women. But now, every statewide office is held by a man. The eight-member Congressional delegation has been all male since Landrieu lost to Bill Cassidy in 2014; Louisiana is one of just 11 states — most of them much smaller — with no women in Congress. And last year the state ranked among the nation's lowest in terms of female representation in the Legislature, at just 18.1%, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

One notable storyline in the two March special elections for Congress — the other in the 2nd Congressional District to replace Cedric Richmond, who has joined the Biden administration — is that both feature major female candidates. Among the best-known hopefuls for Richmond’s old seat is state Sen. Karen Carter Peterson, the former head of the state Democratic Party. So after the runoff in April, it’s possible that at least one or possibly even two women could be joining the delegation.

This is not meant as an endorsement of any particular candidates, just an observation that having diverse representation not only signals what’s possible — think about the message that Harris’ position sends to little girls, and boys — but also brings issues facing people like them into the policy conversation.

Let’s circle back to Guillory’s assumption for a moment. While he’s got no business judging, it is true that our government policies offer precious little support to parents of young children, certainly when compared to the rest of the industrialized world. Even paid parental leave, which has picked up long overdue traction in both parties, remains a long way from becoming reality.

Maybe one reason is that most of the people who represent us haven’t faced these challenges personally. And perhaps one way to change that isn’t to sideline the people who have, but to ask them about their experiences on the campaign trail.",Stephanie Grace: Congressional races put female candidates at center stage,www.nola.com
923,924,https://www.news957.com/2021/01/23/judge-kenosha-shooter-cant-associate-with-supremacists/,"KENOSHA, Wis. — An 18-year-old Illinois teen charged with fatally shooting two people during a protest in southeastern Wisconsin last year is prohibited from associating with known white supremacists under a judge’s recently modified bail conditions.

Kyle Rittenhouse was 17 during the Aug. 25 demonstration in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as hundreds were protesting the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man. Rittenhouse has been charged with multiple counts, including reckless and intentional homicide, endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm.

Prosecutors allege Rittenhouse, who is white, left his home in Antioch, Illinois, and travelled to Kenosha to answer a call for militia to protect businesses. Kenosha was in the throes of several nights of chaotic street demonstrations after a white officer shot Blake in the back during a domestic disturbance, leaving Blake paralyzed.

Rittenhouse opened fire with an assault-style rifle during the protest, killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, authorities said. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to all counts and argued he fired in self-defence. Conservatives have rallied around him, generating enough money to make his $2 million cash bail.

According to online court records, a Wisconsin judge modified Rittenhouse’s conditions of release on Friday to note Rittenhouse “shall not knowingly have conduct with any person or group of persons known to harm, threaten, harass or menace others on the basis of their race, beliefs on the subject of religion, colour, national origin, or gender.”

He is also barred from possessing and consuming alcohol and from having firearms.

Prosecutors had requested the modifications after Rittenhouse was seen drinking at a bar in the southeastern Wisconsin city of Mount Pleasant, about 25 miles (40 kilometres) south of Milwaukee, earlier this month. The legal drinking age is 21, but in Wisconsin, Rittenhouse could legally drink alcohol because he was with his mother.

According to WMTV, prosecutors wrote in their request that Rittenhouse also posed for a photo outside Pudgy’s Pub with two men as they made the “OK” sign with their hands, a symbol used by white supremacists. Prosecutors also alleged five men at the tavern serenaded Rittenhouse with a song that has become the anthem of the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist group.",Judge: Kenosha shooter can't associate with supremacists,www.news957.com

The theft was reported on Thursday, Comox Valley RCMP said in a news release. Sometime after 8 p.m. Wednesday night, a suspect or suspects cut the lock on the gate at a construction site near Maple Lake in Courtenay and stole the trailer-sized generator, police said.

The stolen item is a Wacker Neuson G50 38kw mobile unit, and police believe the suspects used a truck to pull it off the property. They may have travelled south onto the Inland Island Highway, police said.

“We are hopeful someone saw them in the area, since they would have required some time to pull over and cut a chain off one of the tires” said Const. Monika Terragni, media relations officer for Comox Valley RCMP, in the news release.

“This unit would cost approximately $50,000 to replace and is integral to the operation of one of our local businesses,” she added.

Police said the generator theft may be related to another break-in that occurred during the same general time period. The other break-in happened in the 4000 block of Minto Road in Courtenay, and the suspect or suspects in that incident cut a chain-link fence and stole some welding goggles, a Milwaukee impact driver and an acetylene bottle, according to police.

Anyone with information about either of the break-ins should contact the Comox Valley RCMP at 250-338-1321, police said, adding that tips can also be provided anonymously via Crime Stoppers at 800-222-8477.","Generator stolen in Courtenay would cost $50,000 to replace, RCMP say",vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca
926,927,https://www.castanet.net/news/Letters/322841/They-are-being-misled,"Out of curiosity, I put my mask on and travelled into downtown Kelowna last Saturday, to bear witness at the anti-mask rally. I wandered through the platform above the toilets across from City Hall and observed the signs on display as the organizers set up.

From previous reports, there have been up to 150 people in attendance. There were only approximately 40 -50 in attendance this time. I did not want to be associated with, (or in the proximity of) the protesters, so I sat across the street in front of City Hall. A few others joined me as the rally began. Unfortunately, we couldn’t hear most of what the speakers said because they kept sending men from the rally over to harass, take photos and film us. They aggressively confronted the people holding signs, demanding that they “show the science- there is no science”.

I’m thinking, what? I am not in the habit of reading science or medical journals and I don’t expect any of “the masked” do either, but I feel confident that the experts in those fields have the experience and knowledge to make decisions based on scientific FACTS. They are asking us to stay home, wash our hands, keep our distance, and wear a mask when we’re out. I don’t get how anyone can believe that they’re just making it all up.

I have seen facts about Covid-19’s death toll: over 2 million globally, nearly 400,000 in the US, 18,000 in Canada and over 1,000 in BC. What restrictions have done is prevent the medical system from becoming overwhelmed ahead of the development, approval, and distribution of vaccine. As the development of treatments emerge, deaths are less common, but cases continue to increase in many places. The protesters obviously believe that their perceived loss of freedom is more important than protecting our vulnerable populations.

One woman held up a sign with a big red heart saying “LOVE – not fear” and It made me realize that some of these people, not the organizer to be sure, but probably most of the devotees believe that they are “the Good Guys”. Do they realize that their leader, David Lindsay is not a lawyer and a vexatious litigant? And do they realize that he is associated with notorious white supremacist Paul Fromm? Fromm is in the news lately for making political contributions to a conservative politician who has now been thrown under the bus by Conservative leader Erin O’Toole. They are scrambling to distance themselves from the Proud Boys etc. since the fascist insurrection down south.

But I honestly don’t believe that masks and restriction are the real issue of the organizers. My suspicion is that they are hoping to radicalize some angry white folk into their fascist cell, from incels to anti- abortion activists, anti-feminists to gun control activists, Qanon and followers of false prophets.

I just hope and pray that these innocent people will realize that they are being misled now and stop showing up to the rallies. We all want to get through this with as few deaths as possible and unless everyone gets on board, we will see more deaths than we need to. Mr. Lindsay does not deserve the attention and support, it’s time for him to crawl back into his cesspool of hate and deception.",They are being misled - Letters,www.castanet.net

It comes after repeated calls for her to resign amid a number of scathing reportsbringing the Ministry into question.

Moss has been under pressure since a Newsroom investigation into attempts by social workers to remove a week-old baby from its mother in Hawke’s Bay sparked multiple inquiries and reports.

Not having to listen to Grainne Moss’s thick Irish accent lecture us about why the State needs to steal Māori children will be the first relief we gain from her ‘leaving’ as head of Oranga Tamariki.

The extraordinary reality is that she is of course simply being shuffled over to another branch of the Wellington bureaucracy…

Public Service Commissioner Peter Hughes said Moss was a dedicated public servant and leader who had made a number of significant improvements in what was one of the biggest and toughest roles in the public service.

“I commend Mrs Moss for doing what is, at this time, in the best interests of the agency,” Hughes said.

“What she has done today is selfless.”

She has accepted a new role as the chief executive leading the public service’s pay equity work.

“Mrs Moss led the successful pay equity claim for social workers at Oranga Tamariki- Ministry for Children and was also part of the team which developed and delivered pay equity to aged care workers. As such she has significant experience and expertise,” Hughes said.

…that’s the same Peter Hughes who used secret spies to spy on victims of State abuse in a 2007 case so that the MSD didn’t have to pay huge amounts in damages…

Hughes was the boss at MSD when the Crown defended the White case in 2007. The civil case was about many things but it was essentially a test case about the Crown’s liability for abuse of children in state welfare institutions. Crown Law and MSD chucked millions of dollars at defending it because they knew if they lost there were thousands of other victims they’d be paying out substantial damages to.

…the same Peter Hughes who then decried the very use of secret spies he had used when the State got caught doing it again in 2018…

…so fuck anything Peter Hughes has to say in defence of a Wellington Neoliberal Experiment in welfare.

Moss is being reshuffled because ultimately she was simply following orders and they protect their own.

The way they protected their own over the State House meth scandal.

The way they protected their own when MSD took solo mothers to court over welfare debt they should never had been given.

The way they protected their own when the NZDF lied about Afghan civilian deaths

The way the protected their own when beneficiaries are queuing at 2am in the morning because the staff are so toxic.

The way they protected their own when prison riots break out due to inhumane conditions.

The way they protected their own when Oranga Tamariki lied and manipulated when stealing that baby.

The way they protected their own when MPI bent over backwards for commercial fishing interests.

The way their protect their own when Police illegally searched Nicky Hagers house.

The Left in NZ have to understand the first enemy of any progressive revolution is the neoliberal Wellington bureaucracy.

Oranga Tamariki is a neoliberal experiment in Welfare. The argument is that by moving in early and removing children automatically from pre-decided risks, that the cost down stream won’t be as high.

Oranga Tamariki IS NOT about the welfare of the child, it is about the welfare of the State!

The idea is to use big data to create automatic uplifts. No nuance of social worker intuition or insight, National removed parental legal rights and stopped parents from gaining legal aid to fight uplifts.

This is a system with no check or balance other than the Children’s Commissioner releasing reports.

We have allowed a neoliberal welfare experiment to have powers we fought wars to stop other nations gaining over their citizens.

To steal an infant from a mothers arms is the most fascist expression of power there is.

How dare we allow this abomination to stand.

But Moss won’t be held accountable for implementing this cruelty, National won’t be punished for creating it and Labour are too frightened of the PSA to demand actual reform.

In the world of the Wellington neoliberal bureaucracy, black lives matter, but white middle class feminism matters more.

Prosecutors provided that information Saturday when a first-degree murder charge was formally lodged against Sanders over the death of Ellison, 50.

Bail was set at $1.5 million, and Sanders remained in the Peoria County Jail on Saturday afternoon, online jail records showed.

Sanders, 42, was dating Ellison, and was seen carrying large, stuffed bags out of a residence he frequented and getting into a taxi with them, Peoria County State's Attorney Jodi Hoos said Saturday afternoon.

Police spoke to the driver of the cab, who positively identified Sanders, Hoos said, and led them to the wooded area in East Peoria in the 100 block of Woodrow Drive near East Peoria Community High School where he dropped off Sanders.

That's where Ellison's remains had been found on Thursday morning. Tazewell County Coroner Charles Hanley said Saturday afternoon that an autopsy showed she died of blunt force trauma.

Police clashed violently with protesters in Moscow and arrested more than 2,500 in cities across the country Saturday as Russians took to the streets to denounce Kremlin rule and demand the release of Navalny.

""The United States strongly condemns the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists this weekend in cities throughout Russia,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.

Navalny being taken into custody and the arrests of his supporters were ""troubling indications of further restrictions on civil society and fundamental freedoms,"" he added.

""We call on Russian authorities to release all those detained for exercising their universal rights and for the immediate and unconditional release of Aleksey Navalny,"" Price said, using an alternative spelling.

""We urge Russia to fully cooperate with the international community's investigation into the poisoning of Aleksey Navalny and credibly explain the use of a chemical weapon on its soil.""

In Russia tens of thousands nationwide answered Navalny's call to rally, which he issued after he was detained at a Moscow airport on arrival from Germany, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal poisoning with a nerve agent.

Saturday's protests took on an unprecedented geographic scale, spanning more than 100 cities across the country. Previous large-scale opposition demonstrations in 2012 and 2019 were largely centered in Moscow.",US condemns Russia's 'harsh tactics' against Navalny protesters,www.bangkokpost.com

“Today shame is switching sides” from victims to perpetrators, Macron said in a video posted to Twitter, welcoming the fact that “people feel free to speak everywhere in France”.

The flood of testimony under the social media hashtag #Metooinceste followed the early January publication of a book, “La familia grande”, by Camille Kouchner.

In it she accused her step-father, prominent political commentator Olivier Duhamel, of having abused her twin brother.

Macron did not directly address that case.

But in a short video posted to Twitter, he promised those speaking out online: “We are here. We’re listening to you. We believe you. And you will never be alone again.”

And he added: “We have to adapt our laws to better protect child victims of incest and sexual violence.”

Promising to “punish criminals for their acts in the past and prevent them from ever reoffending”, Macron said the law would be updated.

In 2018, France already pushed back the statute of limitations for sexual crimes against minors to 30 years.

But some people have argued such acts should never fall beyond the reach of the justice system.

“No-one can ignore these experiences any longer,” Macron said. “We have to hear and gather victims’ testimonies even years, decades afterwards.”","Macron vows to update France's laws on sex abuse, incest",www.freemalaysiatoday.com

The main issues will evolve around the handling of Covid-19.

While Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha is the prime target of the upcoming debate, the opposition is said to be training their guns on 10 cabinet members from three coalition parties: the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP), the Democrat Party and the Bhumjaithai Party.

The opposition parties are scheduled to meet on Sunday to review and finalise their targets and charges before submitting the no-confidence motion along with the details of the accusations to House Speaker on Monday.

In the previous debate in February last year, Gen Prayut and four ministers faced a grilling and all comfortably survived a vote of no confidence.

Move Forward Party (MFP) leader Pita Limjaroenrat said the upcoming debate will zero in on Gen Prayut and Gen Prawit and will cover the government's failure to tackle economic, social and political problems as well as corruption.

Mr Pita said it does not matter if the government will survive the no-confidence motion, as the opposition's objective is to ""open the people's eyes"" and reduce the government's legitimacy.

However, a source close to the opposition camp said the opposition parties are not on the same page when it comes to who should be grilled and there seems to be some mistrust which they must overcome.

The MFP, a reincarnation of the dissolved Future Forward Party (FFP), and the Seri Ruam Thai Party are reportedly setting their sights on Gen Prayut, Gen Prawit and Mr Suchart over the smuggling of illegal migrant workers who are blamed as the source of the new Covid-19 outbreak.

However, they are concerned the main opposition Pheu Thai Party may not be committed to grilling Gen Prawit who was spared from the intense questioning in the previous debate.

At that time, the FFP accused Pheu Thai of shielding Gen Prawit by hogging most of the debate time and leaving the FFP members without any chance to question the targeted ministers.

Mr Pita, however, assured that he and the opposition leader will see to it that the incident will not be repeated.

According to the source, Pheu Thai is focusing on Gen Prayut over his alleged mismanagement involving illegal migrant workers and illegal gambling dens that led to the new virus outbreak.

The interior minister, the labour minister and Gen Prawit, who supervises the Labour Ministry, will also face the grilling over this. Capt Thammanat Prompow is said to be a target but the allegations against him are not clear.

Mr Jurin, leader of the Democrat Party, is likely to be grilled over the alleged hoarding of face masks in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic while Mr Niphon, also a Democrat minister, will face questions over the controversial Chana industrial complex in Songkhla that faces strong resistance from a coastal community.

Mr Anutin, the Bhumjaithai leader, is being targeted for his role as public health minister while Mr Saksayam has caught attention due to his role in the City Hall-Transport Ministry dispute over a fare increase and concession under the BTS skytrain system.

The MFP wants to grill Mr Anutin over the handling of Covid-19, but Pheu Thai argues that Gen Prayut should be grilled alone because he has invoked the emergency decree and put himself in charge.

Adul Khiewboriboon, chairman of a support group for relatives of the Black May 1992 victims, called on the Pheu Thai Party to use the no-confidence debate for the public good, not as a political tool for self-gain.

""I feel uncomfortable with reports about the party negotiating with those in power as to who will be grilled and who will be spared. I'm begging the opposition to do their job and maintain the public trust in the checks and balances system,"" he said.",Opposition takes aim at 10 ministers,www.bangkokpost.com

939,940,https://www.pjstar.com/story/news/2021/01/23/naacp-calls-sheriffs-facebook-post-inflammatory/6689072002/,"GALESBURG — A Facebook post attributed to Knox County Sheriff David Clague was posted and then quickly deleted Friday, Jan. 15, over language that some community members have called divisive and potentially racially insensitive.

House Bill 3653, passed by the Illinois House and Senate and spearheaded by the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus, and awaiting approval from the governor, could bring big changes to law enforcement, leading to negative reactions about its passage from state law enforcement agencies and organizations.

After its passage, a Facebook post attributed to Clague drew criticism from community members and the Galesburg NAACP branch.

""We have a job to do and that is to protect and serve the citizens of Knox County who have shown their support for us,"" he said. ""Hold your head high and be proud! Resigning is not acceptable and by doing so, it shows the Black Caucus that they won. We are better than that!""

This last statement, with its mention of the Black Caucus, caught the ire of members of the community and brought a denunciation two days later from the Galesburg NAACP, which called it ""inappropriate and inflammatory at best, and carry(ing) racist undertones at its worst.""

The post went on to say that this was especially true in the wake of last summer’s protest movement spurred by the police killing of George Floyd.

“Legislation should not be about who wins or loses; it should be about creating a better democracy. We need a sheriff that will unite and not one that will create unnecessary rifts,” the NAACP post went on to say. “Apologies are simply words that let us know of the acknowledgment of wrongdoing. We want action that is reflective of equity for all people, particularly people of color.”

Answering Register-Mail questions Friday, the NAACP said it spoke out about the statement because it was divisive and pointed specifically at a group composed of people of color.

“The Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police made various statements, no one to my knowledge naming the Illinois Black Caucus,” NAACP President Brittany Grimes said in an email. “Instead, they spoke about the policies. We hope Sheriff Clague can reflect on his statements and understand why it is offensive.”

By the time the NAACP had made its statement, the original post had already been deleted from the sheriff’s office’s page. In its place was a different statement, also attributed to Clague, regarding the earlier post.

“To those who I have offended, I apologize. This was not my intent,” he said, saying that his goal was to “ensure all the men and women of the Knox County Sheriff’s Department shall continue to protect and serve as they have done in the past.”

The Democrat said that he always believed that Knox County citizens support law enforcement, and that he is confident the support would continue.

“I do agree with portions of the reform bill, however my concern is of mandating on some issues with no funding from the state,” Clague said. “We will continue in keeping Knox County a safe community for all. Thank you.”

Clague declined Register-Mail requests to comment on this matter.

While legislators representing the area, the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police, Galesburg police Chief Russ Idle and Clague have been critics of the new bill, the Galesburg NAACP favors the bill.

“(The House bill) does things like eliminate cash bail, which would help reduce systemic inequalities and diminish the cycle of poverty,” Grimes said.

She said the bill will also expand detainee and prisoner rights. Fifty-six percent of Illinois’ prison population is Black, she noted, even as only 15% of those who live in the state are Black.

Grimes also said that the bill expands police transparency and accountability, bans chokeholds and introduces body camera requirements.",NAACP calls Knox County sheriff's Facebook post 'inflammatory',www.pjstar.com

941,942,https://mb.com.ph/2021/01/24/new-warning-on-vaccine-supplies-sparks-eu-concern/,"A warning from AstraZeneca that initial supplies of its Covid vaccinations to Europe will be lower than expected has sparked fresh concern over the rollout of inoculations, forcing some countries to plan for a sharp drop in deliveries.

Friday’s announcement by the British pharmaceutical firm followed another last week by Pfizer, which said it would delay shipments of its vaccine for up to a month due to works at its key plant in Belgium.

The companies’ warnings come amid deepening concern over new Covid-19 variants, particularly one that emerged in Britain and which is believed to be more infectious than the original strain.

Overall, Europe has now recorded more than 692,000 deaths and nearly 32 million infections.

The European Union has so far approved vaccines from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech as well as from US company Moderna. It has not yet approved the vaccine from AstraZeneca and its partner the University of Oxford, but is expected to make a decision by January 29.

AstraZeneca said in its statement that if EU approval was granted, the “initial volumes will be lower than anticipated”, although the start would not be delayed.

The company blamed “reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain”.

It would in any case supply the EU with “millions of doses” while ramping up production in February and March, it added.

The announcement led to “deep dissatisfaction” from EU member states, which “insisted on a precise delivery schedule”, said European Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides.

Austrian Health Minister Rudolf Anschober called it “very, very bad news” and said his country would receive in February only slightly more than half the 650,000 AstraZeneca doses it had expected.

Lithuania said it was expecting an 80-percent reduction in AstraZeneca doses in the first quarter.

Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said of the delay. “It will disrupt our plans.”

Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte meanwhile said in a post to his Facebook page that the government was considering legal action against AstraZeneca’s “unacceptable” announcement.

“If the 60 percent reduction in doses that will distributed in the first quarter should be confirmed, that would mean that 3.4 million doses would be delivered to Italy instead of eight million doses,” he wrote.

Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke, speaking on public television, said the government had a contract with AstraZeneca for 1.5 million vaccine doses in the first quarter.

Now “AstraZeneca says it will be half, instead of 1.5 million there will be 650,000,” he said, calling it “very bad news” while conceding that there can be production problems given the complicated process.

Some government officials however sought to reassure their countries — weary and battered by months of the pandemic and already on edge over slow vaccination rollouts.

“We have new vaccines on the way. We have Pfizer, which is increasing its production capacities,” French industry minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told French radio.

Prime Minister Jean Castex announced on Saturday that France had now passed the one-million vaccination marker.

The EU initially ordered up to 400 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and in total has secured contracts for more than two billion vaccine doses for a total population of 450 million.

The AstraZeneca vaccine has the advantage of being cheaper to produce and being simpler to store and transport than its rivals.

German Health Minister Jens Spahn said that after the jab’s expected approval in a week’s time “there will be AstraZeneca deliveries in February”.

But he added: “How much, we must still clarify with AstraZeneca and the European Union in the days ahead.”

Sweden’s national vaccination coordinator Richard Bergstrom said he expected his country to receive around 700,000 doses in the first month after the vaccine was authorised compared to one million expected initially.

Norway, which is not an EU member but which follows decisions made by the bloc’s EMA regulator, expressed “disappointment”.

Its health authority now expects to receive only 200,000 AstraZeneca doses in February — far less than the 1.12 million initially expected.

Meanwhile, the Pfizer delay announced last week was continuing to cause criticism.

Pfizer said on January 15 that modifications at its Puurs factory were necessary to ramp up vaccine production capacity from mid-February.

“We believe that Pfizer is currently at fault,” Domenico Arcuri, Italy’s special commissioner for the pandemic, told La Stampa newspaper on Saturday, confirming the country planned to pursue legal action against the company.

“The 20-percent reduction in Pfizer vaccine supplies is not an estimation, but a sad certainty,” he said, adding that Italians’ health was not “negotiable”.

943,944,https://kroc.com/scientist-claims-loch-ness-monster-is-actually-an-ancient-sea-turtle/,"Scotland's most infamous creature's mystery may have recently been solved, as a scientist described it as some kind of undiscovered sea turtle that became trapped in Loch Ness.

Professor Henry Bauer's research suggests that a turtle could have been trapped in the Loch when water levels reduced at the end of the most recent Ice Age.

That time period was around 12,000 years ago.

The US scientist worked at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and doesn't believe Nessie was a type of dinosaur.

He thinks all the sightings seem to describe turtle behavior, such as breathing air but living underwater.

Bauer is 89 and retired but had his research published in a respected scientific journal, according to the Daily Record.

The publication said creatures in Loch Ness are yet to be discovered and there could be evidence down there of a large, unknown turtle similar to ones that leave in the oceans today.

""The most popular idea is that the Loch Ness Monster has a relationship to extinct plesiosaurs,"" he explained. ""But this is difficult to square with the rarity of surface sightings, let alone occasional sightings on land.""

""On the other hand, everything described for Loch Ness Monsters is known among the many species of living as well as thought-to-be extinct turtles such as air-breathing but spending very long periods in deep water, ventures onto land, very fast movement in water, ability to be active in very cold water and relatively long necks.""

944,945,https://news.yahoo.com/happen-anybody-virus-claims-36-234411336.html,"LEXINGTON, SC — To those who knew her best, Ashley Bennett was put on this world to be a mother.

At 36, Bennett was a mother of 10 children, ranging in age from 18 years to 2 weeks old. Her older sister, Courtney Bucknam, described her to WLTX as ""amazing.""

“Her world circulated around her children,” Bucknam said during a separate interview with WIS. “She absolutely loved them.”

Bennett was 34 weeks pregnant and preparing for the birth of her youngest child when she, her husband Darryl, and all their children tested positive for coronavirus. 



After an emergency delivery of daughter Eliza on Jan. 1, Bennett's children lost their mother to COVID-19 just seven days later.



Bucknam told WLTX that Bennett had a blood clot that led to a stroke. She was intubated and underwent surgery, but passed on January 8.

She never got to hold Eliza.

“She was an amazing person,” Bucknam told WLTX. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help offset expenses for Bennett's husband and kids.

“If we can learn anything from this, it’s that COVID is so serious, and we need to truly take precautions because she was only 36. She had no underlying conditions, and she was gone basically within 10 days,"" Bucknam said. ""It can happen to anybody.""

As the weekend comes to a close, the United States has reached 25 million confirmed cases of coronavirus. Totals from Johns Hopkins University show the country reached the number late Sunday morning.

With about 4 percent of the world's population, the United States has accounted for about a quarter of the confirmed coronavirus cases across the globe.

Cases and deaths continue to climb, and one public health expert called the milestone an ""incredible scale of tragedy.""



It took the United States about nine months to hit 10 million cases — that milestone was passed on Nov. 8 — but a post-Thanksgiving surge prompted infections to climb at an unprecedented and overwhelming speed.

By the last day of 2020, just seven weeks later, the country had added another 10 million cases.

As the caseload climbs past 25 million, more states are reporting their first cases of the B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant that was first discovered — and now spreading — in the United Kingdom.

All athletic games and practices have been canceled indefinitely at the University of Michigan after the variant was found in five athletes. Washington state is among the other states to have reported its first variant cases in recent days.

In many areas, hospitals remain strained due to the virus.

An Associated Press analysis of federal hospital data shows that since November, the share of U.S. hospitals nearing the breaking point has doubled. More than 40 percent of Americans now live in areas running out of ICU space, with only 15 percent of beds still available.



In the White House, President Joe Biden is spending the first days of his presidency trying to get the virus under control and lessen the toll it's taking on pandemic-weary Americans.

On Friday, Biden signed two more executive orders aimed at curbing the economic damage inflicted by the coronavirus crisis and feeding those suffering from pandemic-induced hunger.



One of the orders calls for a 15 percent increase in benefits received by low-income students through the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer program. It also calls for expanded eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps.

""The American people can't afford to wait,"" Brian Deese, the National Economic Council director, said during a Friday news conference. ""And so many are hanging by a thread. They need help, and we are committed to doing everything we can to provide that help as quickly as possible.""

In Friday's actions, Biden also called for the Office of Personnel Management to develop recommendations to pay more federal employees at least $15 per hour.

Biden is moving with lightning speed to address the pandemic that has infected more than million Americans and claimed more than 415,000 lives in the United States.

Possibly among those hundreds of thousands was legendary broadcaster and talk show host Larry King, who died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 87 years old.

A statement issued by Ora Media, the company he helped found in 2012, did not specifically cite the cause of death for the Brooklyn native and longtime nationally syndicated radio host; however, he was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai last month after testing positive for coronavirus.

King, host of ""Larry King Live"" on CNN, conducted an estimated 50,000 on-air interviews, according to The Associated Press. He was an enduring on-air personality who set himself apart with the curiosity be brought to every interview.

Meanwhile, at least 150 National Guard members sent to Washington, D.C. to provide Inauguration Day security following the deadly Jan. 6 riot on the U.S. Capitol have tested positive for coronavirus, according to a report by Reuters.

In a statement to Reuters, the National Guard said it would not discuss the cases, though a source who spoke to the publication said as many as 200 guard members could be infected and that the number could very likely grow.

More than 25,000 National Guard members were deployed to D.C. in the days leading up to Biden's inaugural. About 7,000 are expected to remain in the city through the end of the month.

In the South, Texas is becoming the latest state to run out of coronavirus vaccines, according to a Times report.

Dr. Esmaeil Porsa, the chief executive of Harris Health System, which treats thousands of mostly uninsured patients, warned on Friday that its entire vaccine supply could be depleted by midday Saturday. 



The problem is not capability, he told the Times — it's availability.

Health officials in Texas and other states are struggling to get answers, growing desperate as inoculation sites cancel thousands of appointments due to long-anticipated vaccines that are suddenly in short supply.

In South Carolina, a hospital in Beaufort had to cancel 6,000 vaccine appointments after it received only 450 of the doses it had expected. In Hawaii, a Maui hospital canceled 5,000 first-dose appointments and placed 15,000 additional requests for appointments on hold, according to The Times.

In other news, Dr. Anthony Fauci is back.

In truth, the nation's leading infectious-diseases expert never really went away. But after enduring nearly a year of darts and undermining comments from now-former President Donald Trump, Fauci now speaks with the authority of the White House again.

During a news conference Thursday, he called it ""liberating"" to be backed by a science-friendly administration that has embraced his recommendations to battle COVID-19.

""One of the new things in this administration is, if you don't know the answer, don't guess,"" Fauci said in one pointed observation during a White House briefing. ""Just say you don't know the answer.""

Also in Washington, D.C., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday quietly changed its immunization guidelines, specifically targeting the second dose of the long-awaited coronavirus vaccine.

According to a New York Times report, the CDC altered guidance to allow those receiving the shot to switch from one vaccine to another in ""exceptional situations."" This means if someone received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, in some cases, they may be able to receive a second dose produced by another pharmaceutical company.

At least 839 deaths and 79,141 new cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States on Sunday as of 2 p.m. ET, according to a Washington Post database. The Post's reporting shows that over the past week, new daily cases fell 21.1 percent, new daily deaths fell 7.4 percent an COVID-19-related hospitalizations fell 9.3 percent.

Currently, 113,609 people are hospitalized with a coronavirus-related illness in the United States, according to the Covid Tracking Project.



As of Sunday, 42 states and U.S. territories remained above the positive testing rate recommended by the World Health Organization to safely reopen. To safely reopen, the WHO recommends states remain at 5 percent or lower for at least 14 days.

As of Sunday afternoon, the United States had reported more than 25 million cases and more than 418,300 deaths from COVID-19-related illnesses, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Police say they arrested Charmille Vincent 18, of Land O' Lakes, on five counts of attempted homicide and one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle, after he was identified as the shooter in this case. An additional suspect, Okeese Shuriah 17, identified as the driver of the vehicle was also arrested in Hillsborough County. He is also charged with five counts of attempted homicide.

The shooting left two Land O' Lakes High School students with minor injuries.

They say the shooting happened early Saturday morning in the Lake Padgett Estates area. PCSO says the shooting involved multiple Land O' Lakes High School students, and they believe all parties involved were juveniles known to each other.

The sheriff's office released surveillance footage from a home in the Lake Padgett Estates neighborhood which shows a vehicle they believe is involved. They say it appears to be a black BMW four-door sedan.

Sheriff Chris Nocco says the two students who were shot did not require hospitalization, and that they are recovering.

Sheriff Nocco also says that while this investigation is ongoing, Land O’Lakes High School will see an increased law enforcement presence.

“We are going to work diligently to make sure that nobody dies because of this violence,” said Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco.

The vaccine, developed with Oxford University, has not yet been approved by the EU regulator but even when the expected green light comes at the end of the month, progress is set to be severely hampered.

AstraZeneca had initially promised to deliver 80 million vaccines to the 27 nations by March, but the order has reportedly been reduced to 31 million – a cut of 60 per cent – in the first quarter of the year.

The pharmaceutical giant said only that ‘initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated’ because of ‘reduced yields’ at one of its manufacturing sites.

EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said there was ‘deep dissatisfaction’ at the news while Ireland’s Taoiseach Micheal Martin said it may have to slow its rollout.

The EU has come under fierce criticism for its laboured rollout of vaccines, with smaller nations accusing the bloc of failing to order enough doses.

According to the most recent data, France has given a first vaccine dose to just 1.4 people per 100, compared to 8.8 per 100 people in the UK.

Meanwhile, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Matt Hancock was involved in a high-stakes, behind-the-scenes battle to stop President Trump’s administration from diverting supplies of the Oxford University vaccine to the US.

The drama took place in April when the university was in talks about joining with the US firm Merck & Co to manufacture the jab.

The talks broke down after the Health Secretary demanded a written guarantee that the US would not be given priority for the supplies – which was not forthcoming.

 FIRST Lady Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa has urged Zimbabwean youths to be responsible and disciplined in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases and deaths by heeding Government call to minimise movement in order to reduce the risk of spreading Covid-19.

In a statement to thank Zimbabweans for heeding the three-day prayer and fasting call, Amai Mnangagwa said most youths were very mobile and have the energy to move around looking for money to fend for their families oblivious of the risk of contracting Covid-19.

“I want to deliver a special message to our youth. It is common knowledge that you carry the greatest energy to hustle and fend for the families. But you have seen your brother, your sister, your parent and grandparent, family friend succumbing to the deadly coronavirus.

“We can only reduce infection by being disciplined and heeding the call to stay at home as much as we should compel ourselves to practising the other measures that keep us safe with utmost determination,” she said.

Amai Mnangagwa said the country has been bedevilled by the pandemic which has taken a heavy toll on Zimbabweans irrespective of position, political affiliation, status, race, tribe, sex or age.

“The pandemic is among us and is taking a heavy toll on us irrespective of position, political affiliation, status in society, race, tribe, sex or age.

“I thus call upon all to rise above things that divide us and unite to conquer. Calamities come but when united we mitigate suffering because the strength of unity so generated will help us through the difficulties we face,” she said.

 The First Lady called for unity of purpose in order for the country to overcome the ravaging pandemic.

“Allow me to reiterate that the solution to win against the pandemic is to unite behind the measures that have been set by Government.

“Let us stay at home, let us mask up properly, let us practise utmost hygiene and observe social and physical distancing, meanwhile testing and isolating when positive, those that get sick being accorded community support and according our dead the dignity possible under the circumstances.

948,949,https://kvia.com/news/us-world/2021/01/22/astronauts-prepare-for-2-upcoming-spacewalks/,"HOUSTON, Texas — Astronauts Mike Hopkins and Victor Glover Jr. are preparing for two upcoming spacewalks that will help to upgrade and maintain the International Space Station. The NASA astronauts will conduct spacewalks on Wednesday, January 27, and Monday, February 1.

It will be the first spacewalk experience for Glover, who is a few months into his first spaceflight on the station.

This will be the third spacewalk for Hopkins, who previously completed two spacewalks during his first six-month venture to the space station from September 25, 2013, to March 10, 2014.

Hopkins, Glover, NASA astronaut Shannon Walker and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Soichi Noguchi flew to the station in November aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon Resilience spacecraft. They joined NASA astronaut Kate Rubins and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, who were already on the station after launching in October.

Both spacewalks will be broadcast live on the NASA website, with coverage beginning each day at 5:30 a.m. ET. The spacewalks are scheduled to begin at 7 a.m. ET and are expected to last for six and a half hours. They will be the 233rd and 234th spacewalks in support of the space station.

For both spacewalks, Hopkins will wear the spacesuit bearing red stripes as crew member 1 and Hopkins will wear the spacesuit with no stripes as crew member 2.

The astronauts will focus on completing the installation of Bartolomeo, the newest payload hosting station outside the European Space Agency’s Columbus module, on January 27. They will complete antenna and cable rigging to hook up power and data connections.

The Bartolomeo platform, named after the younger brother of Christopher Columbus, is the first instance of a European commercial partnership that offers a place to conduct science and technology demonstrations outside of the space station, according to the European Space Agency.

The Columbus module will also be upgraded with a terminal that provides an independent high-bandwidth communication link for European ground stations.

The astronauts will install the final lithium-ion battery adapter plate on February 1. This installation wraps up work to complete the replacement of aging batteries outside the station that began in January 2017.

During both spacewalks, Rubins will operate the robotic arm from inside the space station to assist the astronauts as they work outside.

They will focus on other upgrades, like replacing an external standard camera with a new high-definition camera on the Destiny laboratory, and will replace camera and light assembly components needed for the Japanese robotic arm’s camera system, located outside of the Kibo module.

“We’ve been talking about these two EVAs (extra-vehicular activities) for the better part of a year, so we’re excited to see them executed,” said Kenny Todd, deputy manager for the International Space Station Program at NASA during a press conference Friday.

There are more spacewalks planned for the crew near the end of February and beginning of March.

Glover and Rubins will pair up for the third spacewalk to prepare the station’s power system for installing new solar arrays, which will increase the station’s power supply.

During these long spacewalks, the astronauts go through alternating cycles of day and night every 45 minutes, operating against the hot, bright light of the sun as well as the cold darkness of space. This happens because the space station is orbiting the Earth at 17,500 miles per hour.

While the astronauts don’t feel the direct impacts of extreme cold and heat, there is the potential for a chill, so there are heaters installed in the astronauts’ gloves to keep their hands warm, said Vincent Lacourt, spacewalk flight director at NASA for the February 1 spacewalk.",Astronauts prepare for 2 upcoming spacewalks,kvia.com

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has said he isn't feeling the pressure ahead of the FA Cup game against Manchester United on Sunday (live at 1 p.m. ET on ESPN+) after his side's poor run of form.

The 2019-20 champions broke a 68-game unbeaten record at Anfield on Thursday when they lost 1-0 to Burnley and have now gone 438 minutes in the league without scoring.

Despite the results not going Liverpool's way, Klopp said he isn't feeling any pressure yet.

""I don't feel the pressure from outside. I deal with the pressure I put on myself my entire life already so I am kind of used to that,"" Klopp told a news conference on Friday.

""I know myself I am good enough. It is pretty happy to make me really happy in the long-term. Short-term I am quite easy to excite but long-term is not easy.

""When you had the success we had, there are two directions. One is you keep going exactly on the same level which is difficult with the challenges you have around and the other one it [performance] gets a little bit less. So in the moment it feels a lot less and that is what we have to change.""

Liverpool are in fourth position while their nearest rivals, Tottenham and Everton, both have games in hand over them.

United on the other hand are top of the Premier League table with 40 points, six clear of Liverpool.

However, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has said that, despite Liverpool's injury list, they are still a top team and beating them won't be an easy task.

""Yeah, [Virgil] Van Dijk is not there but everyone's got an injury or two here or there,"" Solskjaer said on Friday. ""[At Anfield on Sunday] they had five midfielders there to play out plus a keeper who is very capable.

""We played against a top Liverpool team. It's not easy.

950,951,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9180435/MAIL-SUNDAY-COMMENT-spectacular-public-spirited-offer-Boris-Johnson-accept.html,"To the dismay of those who will never forgive him for Brexit, Boris Johnson is again demonstrating his ability to achieve success where others fail or will not dare.

The mass vaccination against Covid, itself the fruit of brilliant British science, is now bringing hope and comfort to millions – hope for those who long for release, comfort for those who fear the virus.

It turns out that it is perfectly possible, under strong leadership and intelligent direction, for the Government machine to deliver a major project, on time and efficiently.

Let us hope that the lessons are learned for the future, and that other state projects will follow this example.

It is, of course, absolutely right that the vaccination programme has targeted the most vulnerable first, and this should certainly continue until all these categories have been given protection.

But that moment will provide an opportunity for a new and ingenious initiative, which The Mail on Sunday today urges Mr Johnson and his colleagues to consider actively.

A group of top schools in the private and state sector have come together to make a spectacular, public-spirited offer.

They are suggesting that the Government uses their premises and trained staff to set up dozens of extra vaccination centres. And then, once medical priority cases have been dealt with, they propose a bold programme to immunise teachers and other school staff in time for the second half of the current term. At the very least this should make it possible to reopen primary schools and the examination years of secondary schools. At a stroke, it would sweep aside many of the objections to school reopening and restore one of the most important parts of our national life.

Surely the teachers’ unions, who rightly proclaim the importance of their profession to our economy and society, would welcome this recognition that they are correct?

In truth there are few more urgent tasks than to find a way to get the schools – and then the universities – to open up again.

Schools perform many more functions than simple education. They provide routine and early experience of good work habits to their students. They provide the social interaction that makes the difference between life and solitary existence. They provide proper meals to children from homes where such things are sadly rare. They sometimes allow teachers to spot serious problems at home that might never otherwise come to light. And, of course, they free parents to go out to work during school hours.

Many schools have coped extraordinarily well with the challenge of remote learning, and this newspaper congratulates those who have.

But others have done less well – not least because of the grave shortage of computers in poorer homes, which make the idea of distance learning more or less impossible for some youngsters.

But in general it is true that the lockdown of schools has hit the children of the poor far harder than the children of the well-off middle classes.

In 21st Century Britain, which the Prime Minister is publicly committed to levelling up, this gap is intolerable and needs to be closed. One of the most effective ways of doing so is to get the schools fully open again, as soon as reasonably possible.

In the same spirit with which he has tackled the vaccination programme, Mr Johnson should now accept this generous and thoughtful suggestion.",MoS: A spectacular and public-spirited offer Boris should accept,www.dailymail.co.uk
951,952,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2021/01/24/us-demands-more-data-on-uk-variant-amid-vaccine-efficacy-concerns/,"WASHINGTON: The US is closely watching the more infectious variant of Covid-19 after British officials warned that it may also be more deadly, two top US health officials said on Saturday, cautioning more data is needed.

Officials are somewhat more worried about a separate variant from South Africa, although it has not yet been identified among US cases of the novel coronavirus, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins and Dr Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s top Covid-19 medical adviser, also said.

Collins noted the UK’s data was preliminary, and said it was unclear why those with the UK variant faced a higher risk of death, whether by changes in the virus itself or other external causes such as pressures on the healthcare system.

“Let’s take this as something to watch closely,” he told MSNBC in an interview.

Fauci separately told MSNBC that he needed to see the raw data from the UK before fully assessing the mortality risk and that US officials were weighing how the two new strains could impact vaccine efficacy.

“These are serious situations that we are following very closely and, if necessary, we will adapt to it,” Fauci said, adding vaccines could be altered in coming months if needed.

Their comments come as Democratic President Joe Biden takes the reins of the nation’s Covid-19 response, seeking to re-energise the fight against the highly infectious disease and urging a war-like stance.

In a flurry of actions since taking office Wednesday, Biden unveiled a new US strategic plan to curtail the outbreak and signed numerous executive orders to boost vaccines and increase mask use, among other measures.

The US is the nation hardest-hit by Covid-19, with 24.70 million cases and 413,775 deaths by midnight Friday. Over the past week, 3,089 Americans have died of the disease on average, while 20 US states reported record deaths this month.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday warned that the UK variant was associated with higher levels of mortality.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week warned the UK variant, already circulating in at least 10 US states, could become the dominant variant in the US by March.

The variant, known as B.1.1.7, is believed to be twice as contagious as the current one circulating nationwide.

“At the moment we are not alarmed about that,” Collins said, given that vaccines still appeared effective against it. “We are somewhat more concerned about a South African variant.”

Fauci, US top infectious disease expert, echoed his concerns, calling data on the South Africa variant a bit more “ominous” even as current vaccines still appeared to protect against both variants.

Scientists on Wednesday said the South African variant may reduce the efficacy of current vaccines, which also raises the prospect of re-infection.

Britain has banned travellers from some African countries in an attempt to stop the spread of that strain in the UK and is weighing further restrictions.

Biden has moved to impose a mandatory quarantine for air passengers arriving in the US, although details have not yet been released. He is also requiring US-bound passengers to have a negative Covid-19 test starting on Tuesday.

Even without a greater mortality risk, more contagious variants increase the pressure on officials to vaccinate the population – a campaign many state and local officials have said has been slow and chaotic and one Biden has pledged to improve.

“When you get more cases, you’re going to get more hospitalisations. And when you get more hospitalisations, you’re ultimately going to get more deaths,” Fauci told reporters at the White House on Thursday.",US demands more data on UK variant amid vaccine efficacy concerns,www.freemalaysiatoday.com

The British company has told European Union officials that production problems will mean a cut in deliveries of its COVID-19 vaccine to the bloc by 60 per cent to 31 million doses in the first quarter of the year.

“AstraZeneca was going to be the catalyst to be allowed to move from low level to mass vaccination,’’ Martin told Irish broadcaster RTE in an interview.

He said that delivery delays would “put us in a problem’’.

Ireland has focused its inoculation campaign on care home residents and frontline healthcare workers so far.

But Martin said the government still aimed to achieve mass vaccination by the end of the second quarter.

Deaths in the country due to COVID-19 are currently at their highest level since the pandemic began, with 44 per day on average in the past week, a senior health official said on Thursday.

The infection rate, however, has fallen sharply from a peak registered earlier in January.

As of Thursday, there was an average of 2,430 new cases over the past five days, down from a five-day average of 4,473 reported a week ago.

Still, Martin said it was still too early to consider easing strict restrictions on movement and economic activity.

He said reopening schools would mean “mobilising a million people at one time’’, with the government leaning towards a staged return to the classrooms that could keep some schools closed until mid-March.

 PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has reaffirmed his commitment to save the people of Zimbabwe from the agony brought about by Covid-19 declaring that the country will spare no effort and no resource to save the lives of the country’s citizens.

He said the Government will however, prioritise healthcare workers and other frontline personnel in the vaccination against Covid-19 which the country will soon roll out after making representation with countries that have developed the vaccine.

Addressing the nation yesterday, President Mnangagwa said Government experts were finalising their researches and assessment on the most appropriate vaccine with no detrimental effects on people’s bodies. The President said the country was expecting to receive the vaccine soon.

“We will spare no effort, spare no resource to save the lives of Zimbabweans. We will spare no effort to protect our frontline staff who have served us remarkably well under very challenging conditions in these trying times. They are the heroes and heroines of our nation and should receive priority protection so they in turn protect you, me, all of us.

“Once we receive the vaccine and it will be quite soon, they will be the first ones to be inoculated. Government has and is engaging countries which have developed vaccines. Help and relief are on their way. Our experts who have been assessing different vaccines are very close to finalising the course to recommend to our nation.

A course which brings relief and which we will roll out across the length and breadth of our nation so we do not lose more lives than has become inevitable. A course which ensures that the vaccines we introduce in our bodies are both safe and effective,” he said.

President Mnangagwa said the Covid-19 situation in the country required collective effort as well as widening the scope in responding to the increasing cases.

“Our recovery rates are once more beginning to creep up. While we are facing increasing number of cases requiring hospitalisation and close professional care there is scope for increasing our capacities to respond in order to cope with the likely upsurge. Our frontline continues to give their very best and we owe them greatly for their huge sacrifices,” he said.

President Mnangagwa said Government was ready to put in place more stringent measures if need be in order to minimise the possible spread of the virus. He said law enforcement agencies were out in full force to ensure lockdown compliance.

“On the ground, the lockdown is holding, with more and more Zimbabweans voluntarily taking measures that are necessary to protect themselves, their families, their friends and their fellow countrymen and countrywomen. Our law enforcement agencies are active manning all key points. We are ready with more deployments and ready to prescribe stronger measures should that become necessary.”

President Mnangagwa said the pandemic was not sparing anyone regardless of social standing, political affiliation, race, gender or creed.

“The pandemic has been indiscriminate in its grim harvest. Zimbabweans from all walks of life, all stations, all tribes, all races, all religions, have succumbed to it. We have all lost loved ones, we have lost ministers of Government and other officials. We have lost more across the political divide. The danger we face meets us as Zimbabweans, whatever our station, colour, creed or politics,” he said.

The President said people should abide by the guidelines prescribed by World Health Organisation and the Ministry of Health and Child Care in the fight against the pandemic.

“We must mask up, wearing our masks properly, making sure we cover our mouth and nose. We must stay at home only leaving our homes when it is absolutely necessary and unavoidable. We must practise maximum hygiene at all times in all places. We must practise social distancing as individuals, families and communities.

We must stop going to private parties and gatherings. We must report suspicious cases of returnees. Once we feel unwell, exhibiting symptoms adjudged suggestive of Covid-19 we must seek help and get tested. Should we turn positive we must isolate until we recover fully and are safe to resume normal lives,” he said.",We’ll spare no effort to save lives: President…Experts assess different Covid-19 vaccines,www.sundaynews.co.zw

956,957,https://www.register-herald.com/news/dark-money-helped-pave-joe-bidens-path-to-white-house/article_9deb62dc-5dd8-11eb-bb65-7b456baeb590.html,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden benefited from a record-breaking amount of donations from anonymous donors to outside groups backing him, meaning the public will never have a full accounting of who helped him win the White House.

Biden's winning campaign was backed by $145 million in so-called dark money donations, a type of fundraising Democrats have decried for years. Those fundraising streams augmented Biden's $1.5 billion haul, in itself a record for a challenger to an incumbent president.

That amount of dark money dwarfs the $28.4 million spent on behalf of his rival, former President Donald Trump. And it tops the previous record of $113 million in anonymous donations backing Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012.

Democrats have said they want to ban dark money as uniquely corrupting since it allows supporters to quietly back a candidate without scrutiny. Yet in their effort to defeat Trump in 2020, they embraced it.

For example, Priorities USA Action Fund, the super political action committee that Biden designated as his preferred vehicle for outside spending, used $26 million in funds originally donated to its nonprofit arm, called Priorities USA, to back Biden. The donors of that money do not have to be disclosed.

Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, was unapologetic. ""We weren't going to unilaterally disarm against Trump and the right-wing forces that enabled him,"" he said in a statement.

Campaign finance laws, in theory, are supposed to limit the influence big money has over politicians. But the system has gaping loopholes, which groups backing Biden and other candidates have exploited.

""He benefited from it,"" said Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission.

A Biden spokesman did not immediately respond to attempts to seek comment.

His campaign called for banning some types of nonprofits from spending money to influence elections and requiring that any organization spending more than $10,000 to influence elections to register with the FEC and disclose its donors.

Biden raised more than $1 billion for his campaign, which can accept donations of up to $2,800 per election from individuals. That included $318.6 million from donors who gave less than $200 each. The rest of the money Biden raised came from donors with pockets deep enough to give as much as $825,000, with that money being divided among the Democratic National Committee and 47 state parties.

Dark money is not the biggest source of cash to campaigns. Wealthy donors can write eight-figure checks to super-PACs, Noble pointed out. Joint fundraising committees that raise money for campaigns and parties can bring in chunks of $830,500.

Donors who want to avoid disclosure can give to political nonprofits, like Defending Democracy Together, which spent $15.6 million backing Biden, and aren't required to disclose their contributors to the FEC. Donors can also give money to a nonprofit that in turn gives the money to a super-PAC, like Priorities USA did. Candidates and their campaigns can't coordinate spending with such groups under federal law.

And that lack of disclosure worries reform groups.

Big donors — individuals or corporations — who contributed anonymously will have the same access to decision makers as those whose names were disclosed, but without public awareness of who they are or what influence they might wield.

""The whole point of dark money is to avoid public disclosure while getting private credit,"" said Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, which advocates for reducing the influence of money on politics. ""It's only dark money to the public.""

Overall, Democrats in this election cycle benefited from $326 million in dark money, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That was more than twice the $148 million that supported Republican groups. Some of the Democratic groups that relied on dark money in whole or in part spent heavily on early ads attacking Trump in critical battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The groups started spending while Biden's relatively cash-poor campaign was struggling to raise money for the primaries.

Future Forward PAC, a super-PAC that spent $104 million backing Biden, got $46.9 million from Facebook Inc. co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, $3 million from Twilio Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Lawson and $2.6 million from Eric Schmidt of Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google. But its biggest source of funds was its sister nonprofit, Future Forward USA Action, which contributed $61 million. The names of those who put up the $61 million don't have to be disclosed.

The Sixteen Thirty Fund, a nonprofit that sponsors progressive advocacy, donated a total of $55 million in the 2020 election cycle to Democratic super-PACs, including Priorities USA Action Fund and Future Forward PAC, FEC records show. That total was much more than the $3 million it gave in 2018.

Amy Kurtz, executive director of the Sixteen Thirty Fund, said the surge of money to the group, which doesn't disclose the names of its donors, included people who previously gave to Republicans or had not been engaged in politics.

The flood of dark money to Democrats and progressive groups has complicated their effort to reform the system.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, has blamed dark money for persuading Republicans to block legislation to address climate change and assuring judges who share their views are appointed to the courts.

""Dark money is toxic to democracy — period,"" Whitehouse said in a statement. ""The fact that progressive groups have learned to fight back using similar tactics is no excuse for continuing the plague of dark money in America.""

Kurtz says her group would prefer rules that eliminated dark money.

""We have lobbied in favor of reform to the current campaign finance system,"" she said, referring to H.R. 1, an election reform measure Democrats have proposed that includes more rigorous disclosure of donors to political nonprofits, ""but we remain equally committed to following the current laws to level the playing field for progressives.""

Even Cecil, who runs the super-PAC supporting Biden, said the group supports reform.

Xiyue Wang, who spent more than three years in an Iranian prison before being freed by the Trump administration in 2019, raised numerous concerns about reports that President Joe Biden is set to tap Robert Malley as his new envoy to Iran. Malley, a veteran foreign policy hand, was fired from former president Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign after it was revealed he held unauthorized talks with Hamas, the Iranian-backed terror group that has murdered Americans. Malley was hired by the Obama White House in 2014 and is now being considered as the new administration’s top Iran envoy, which would put him in charge of conducting diplomacy with Tehran.

Malley’s possible appointment in the new administration has drawn widespread criticism from Republican hawks in Congress but has been praised by former Obama administration officials, such as Ben Rhodes, the onetime White House National Security Council member who helmed the Obama administration’s self-described pro-Iran ""echo chamber,"" which was used to push the Iran nuclear deal. Rhodes, on Twitter this week, dismissed concerns about Malley’s appointment, saying that prominent Iran hardliners like Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) and others should not have a say in the matter.

Wang, in response to Rhodes, accused him and other Malley allies of ""dismissing the concerns of former political prisoners and U.S. hostages,"" calling it ""unprofessional and offensive.""

""As my own story illustrates, not everything is about partisan D.C. politics,"" he said.

Wang claimed that Malley did nothing to secure his release when he was abducted by the Iranians in 2016, a year after the Obama administration inked the landmark nuclear accord, which provided Tehran with sanctions relief and billions in cash windfalls.

""During my imprisonment Mr. Malley was a senior White House official,"" Wang wrote. ""He played no positive role in facilitating my release, a view shared by present and past hostages and their families. If he is appointed, it’d suggest releasing U.S. hostages from Iran won’t be a priority.""

Wang said he has a unique understanding of the hardline regime in Iran: ""I’ve likely had more intensive contact with Iranian hardliners than most Iran watchers in the U.S., especially U.S. government officials like Mr. Rhodes and Malley.""

Navalny had called on his supporters to protest after being arrested last weekend as he returned to Russia from Germany for the first time since being poisoned with a nerve agent he says was slipped to him by state security agents in August.

The authorities had warned people to stay away from Saturday's demonstrations, saying they risked catching COVID-19 as well as prosecution and possible jail time for attending an unauthorised event.

But protesters defied the ban and, in at least one case in temperatures below -50 Celsius (-58 Fahrenheit), turned out in force. Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally, called on them to do the same next weekend to try to free Navalny from what he called ""the clutches of his killers"".

In central Moscow, where Reuters reporters estimated up to 40,000 people had gathered in one of the biggest unauthorised rallies for years, police were seen roughly detaining people, bundling them into nearby vans.

The authorities said just some 4,000 people had shown up, while the foreign ministry questioned Reuters' crowd estimate.

""Why not just immediately say 4 million?"" it suggested sarcastically on its official Telegram messenger channel.

Ivan Zhdanov, a Navalny ally, put turnout in the capital at 50,000, the Proekt media outlet reported.

Some protesters chanted ""Putin is a thief"", and ""Disgrace"" and ""Freedom to Navalny!""

Navalny's wife Yulia was briefly detained at the rally before being released. Some of Navalny's political allies were detained in the days before the protest; others on the day itself.

At one point, protesters surrounded a sleek black car with a flashing light used by senior officials, throwing snowballs at it and kicking it. A group of policemen were also pelted with snowballs by a much bigger crowd.

The OVD-Info protest monitor group said that 3,134 people, including 1,201 in Moscow and 471 in St Petersburg, had been detained at rallies in around 100 towns and cities.

The United States condemned what it described as ""harsh tactics"" used against protesters and journalists and called for Navalny's ""immediate and unconditional"" release.

""We call on Russian authorities to release all those detained for exercising their universal rights,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.

The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a post on Twitter that he deplored the authorities ""disproportionate use of force"", while Britain's foreign minister, Dominic Raab, condemned the ""use of violence against peaceful protesters and journalists"".

Navalny, a 44-year-old lawyer, is in a Moscow prison pending the outcome of four legal matters he describes as trumped up. He accuses President Vladimir Putin of ordering his attempted murder. Putin has dismissed that, alleging Navalny is part of a U.S.-backed dirty tricks campaign to discredit him.

Some protesters marched on the prison, where police were waiting to arrest them.

Images of protesters with injuries such as bloodied heads circulated on social media.

The scenes were reminiscent of the months-long unrest in Russia's neighbouring ally Belarus where anti-government protests flared last August over allegations of voter fraud.

One Moscow protester, Sergei Radchenko, 53, said: ""I'm tired of being afraid. I haven't just turned up for myself and Navalny, but for my son because there is no future in this country.""

There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, which had previously called the protests illegal and the work of ""provocateurs"".

State prosecutors opened criminal cases into alleged violence against police officers by protesters.

In Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, nearly 1,000 people demonstrated against Navalny's arrest. Small demonstrations were also held in Bulgaria and some 200-300 people protested in Paris.

Police in Siberia's Yakutsk, one of the coldest cities in the world, where the temperature was -52 Celsius (-62 F) on Saturday, grabbed a protester by his arms and legs and dragged him into a van, video footage showed.

In Moscow, some journalists covering the protests were detained, drawing a rebuke from the U.S. Embassy.

""Russian authorities arresting peaceful protesters, journalists,"" spokesperson Rebecca Ross said on Twitter. ""Appears to be a concerted campaign to suppress free speech, peaceful assembly.""

There were outages on mobile phone and internet services, the monitoring site downdetector.ru showed, a tactic sometimes used by authorities to make it harder for protesters to communicate among themselves.

In a push to galvanise support ahead of the protests, Navalny's team released a video this week about an opulent palace on the Black Sea they alleged belonged to Putin, something the Kremlin denied. As of Saturday the video had been viewed more than 70 million times.

Navalny's allies hope to tap into what polls say are pent-up frustrations among the public over years of falling wages and economic fallout from the pandemic.

But Putin's grip on power looks unassailable for now and the 68-year-old president regularly records an approval rating of over 60%, much higher than that of Navalny.

(AP) - Mississippi's top health official criticized the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine within the state's long-term care facilities Friday, calling the plan made by the federal government and pharmacies contracted to give the shots “faulty” and ”frustrating.""

“We gave them too much vaccine too soon,” State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said during a virtual briefing with the Mississippi State Medical Association, adding that the situation is now a “daunting problem” for health officials.The Department of Health is now having conversations with CVS and Walgreens about whether some of the doses allocated to them need to be pulled back, Dobbs said.

CVS and Walgreens were allocated 47,000 doses of vaccine in December to inoculate long-term care residents, per the federal government. As of Friday, only about 14,000 doses have been administered. Mississippi has about 36,000 residents living in nursing facilities and 25,000 living in other long-term care settings.

That's compared with 150,786 doses that have been administered statewide, according to the Department of Health. The state is using 19 drive-thru facilities, clinics and hospitals to complete vaccinations for those 65 and older, health care workers and those who are at least 16 and have health conditions that might make them more vulnerable to the virus.

Overall, Dobbs said, the state is doing “remarkably well” at vaccinating people who are not long-term care residents — the state had used 75% of its allocation for first doses as of Friday. Still, officials at the drive-thru sites and other facilities offering vaccinations have not been able to come close to keeping up with the demand.

“If we could have given them 4,000 a week like they're using, then we could have used that other vaccine,"" Dobbs said of long-term care facilities.

The state health officer said it's been a “real challenge"" as his team tries to plan for the future.

""We expected them to be done a couple of weeks ago, like maybe last week, with everybody,"" Dobbs said.

Officials with CVS and Walgreens have assured the Department of Health that vaccinations will be 95% done by the end of January, Dobbs said. Department of Health officials are meeting with representatives from the pharmacies again on Monday.

Dobbs said the delay has been partially due to slow rollout by CVS and Walgreens and also to “sluggish” uptake of the vaccine, especially among staff at long-term care facilities.

The department reported Friday that Mississippi had 2,050 new confirmed cases of the virus as of Thursday evening. The department also reported 45 deaths Friday, 27 of which happened between Jan. 16 and Thursday. The state has reported about 261,000 cases of the virus and 5,713 related deaths since the start of the pandemic.

 PRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday sent condolence messages to the Matiza and Zimondi families following the passing on of Minister of Transport and Infrastructure Development Dr Joel Biggie Matiza and former Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) Commissioner-General, Retired Major-General Paradzai Zimondi.

Both Dr Matiza and Maj-Gen Zimondi succumbed to Covid-19 related complications on Friday aged 60 and 74 respectively.

“It was with profound shock and sadness that I learnt of the death yesterday of our Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development and Zanu PF Provincial Chairman for Mashonaland East Province, Dr Joel Biggie Matiza, after succumbing to Covid-19 related illness.

“The death of Dr Matiza adds to the pain and anguish in Government, the ruling party, and more so to our nation, following last week’s deaths of prominent public figures including two government ministers one of whom, our late national hero and Cabinet colleague, Retired Lieutenant General Dr S B Moyo, still awaits burial.”

President Mnangagwa said the sudden death of Dr Matiza created a void in Government which would be difficult to fill.

“As we mourn his sad departure, we commit ourselves to honouring him by taking forward the infrastructural projects which he championed with such extraordinary passion.

“On behalf of the ruling party, Zanu-PF, Government, my family, and indeed on my behalf, I wish to express my sincere condolences to the Matiza family, especially to his wife Lilian and the children who have lost a loving husband, father and a shoulder to lean on. May they be rest assured in the knowledge that the nation joins them in this hour of grief.”

President Mnangagwa said the nation had lost a pillar of strength in consolidating the gains of Independence.

 “Soft-spoken, cheerful and a workaholic, the late Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development had helped in re-awakening the otherwise dormant construction industry into a vibrant sector.

“Under his leadership, the sector and our engineers were beginning to tackle bigger projects, executing them to world standards. The results have been evident, most notably, the rehabilitation of our national highways under the first phase of the National Rehabilitation Programme.”

The President said Maj-Gen (Rtd) Zimondi’s death conjured pain and sorrow as he had only recently started his retirement.

“Major General (Rtd) Zimondi’s death evokes pain and sorrow as two months ago, he had started a well-deserved rest from public service following his retirement from long, meritorious service to his nation. He had set his sights on fulfilling his long-delayed passion for full-time commercial farming.

“A decorated soldier and veteran of the liberation struggle, the late Retired Major General Zimondi Tonderai Nyika will forever be remembered for his immense contribution to the freedom and independence of Zimbabwe, and for defending the gains of that freedom, initially as a senior officer in the Zimbabwe National Army.”

President Mnangagwa said the passing on of Maj-Gen Zimondi robs the country of the remaining crop of brave cadres who transformed the armed liberation struggle from the front.

“His record in combat operations were nothing short of legendary. On behalf of the ruling party, Zanu-PF, Government, my family, and indeed on my behalf, I wish to express deep heartfelt condolences to the Zimondi family for the loss of their beloved son who was a father figure and family mentor. May they take comfort from the knowledge that we share in their great loss as he was no longer theirs alone, but ours together.”","President mourns Matiza, Zimondi",www.sundaynews.co.zw
966,967,https://blackdoctor.org/spreading-the-word-on-vaccine-distribution-in-mississippi-to-increase-black-numbers/,"Mississippi vaccination numbers are improving, but the number of African Americans receiving the vaccine is not.

As of Thursday, a total of 85,829 Mississippians have been vaccinated, 77,223 have received the first dose and 8,606 have received the second dose.

A breakdown of that number by race, reveals only 15% of vaccinations have been Black people while 63% are white.

Mississippi State Department of Health’s Dr. Thomas Dobbs says 15% is very low.

“This is actually worse than it was a couple of weeks ago, so this is a huge challenge,” said Dobbs. “We are going to try to make sure we open more locations in areas where there is a need.”

Dobbs said drive-thru vaccination sites will be opened in Hinds, Warren, Scott, and Alcorn Counties along with others.

“But that’s not enough because we have a lot of outlying areas where people don’t have access to the drive-thru and they can’t drive, and that’s one of the things we’re struggling with now is that we equitably distribute the vaccine under this new paradigm,” Dobbs said.

Surgeon General Jerome Adams says vaccine disparities are due to a long history of distrust, and in order to move forward, those reasons need to be acknowledged.

But he is not just a medical professional whose inoculation inspires public confidence: the 47-year-old has undergone kidney transplant twice and says the related comorbidities he suffers from didn’t stop him.“As a dentist, there is risk of Covid infection as we deal with saliva and aerosols during dental procedures and hence it is better to be protected,” said Nirmal. “In addition, with me being a kidney recipient twice, and on immunosuppressant medication, I’m even more vulnerable. I consulted doctors and they said the Covid vaccine does not interfere with the drugs that I am on. Covid is here to stay and the vaccine is a necessity.”Nirmal heads the department of prosthodontics at Theerthankar Mahaveer Dental College and Research Centre in Moradabad . He took the vaccine on January 16, the day the nationwide drive was launched.Nirmal underwent the first kidney transplant in 2008 and his mother was the donor. In 2014, symptoms of renal failure resurfaced. From 2015 to 2018, he was on dialysis and in March 2018, he underwent kidney transplant for the second time, through a cadaver donor.Like all others, Nirmal admits, he too initially had doubts about taking the vaccine. “I went ahead with the vaccination after thorough consultation with experts in the field. The vaccine does not interfere with the medicines renal patients like me take and does not aggravate comorbidities,” said Nirmal, adding that he has not experienced any side-effects so far.Nirmal’s talk post-vaccination is now getting traction on social media pages. “Dr Nirmal taking the vaccine is an encouragement for many,” said Sundar Nirmal said the perception among kidney patients and organ recipients who have not been infected is that they are safe and it is better without the vaccine. “During the lockdown, when several parts of India reported increasing Covid cases, everyone was at home. But now, everyone is out for work or studies. That’s why there is a need to take the vaccine and be safe,” he explained.Most dialysis patients are on heparin, an anticoagulatory drug, and caution needs to be taken, said Sundar. “Heparin must be avoided a day prior to the vaccination, on the day of vaccination and a day after that. So, for three days in all. Those who are on heparin should avoid any intramuscular injection on the days of dialysis, not just Covid vaccine. Any kidney patient must consult their doctor before going for Covid vaccination.”","Bengaluru doctor with double kidney transplant takes jab, recommends it | India News - Times of India",timesofindia.indiatimes.com
968,969,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9180395/Were-rushing-lot-younger-patients-hospital.html,"In a devastating dispatch, one paramedic working in south-east England reveals the chilling reality of life on the Covid front line.

As hospitals see a dramatic rise in younger patients needing treatment, medics are still having to deal with other emergencies, including heart attacks, births and accidents…

MONDAY: CANCER PATIENT IS SCARED TO GO TO HOSPITAL

I've wanted to be a paramedic since I was seven years old but nothing could have prepared me for this. Every day is like New Year's Eve on steroids.

Queues outside hospitals are now measured in hours instead of minutes. The word 'unprecedented' has almost become a cliche but we've really never seen scenes like this before.

My 12-hour shift starts at 6.30am. While the driver, an ex-police officer, checks the lights, I give our equipment the once over: defibrillator, oxygen canisters, airway kit, canulas, drugs, stretcher, PPE and a grab bag filled with essentials.

Immediately, we're sent to relieve another crew who are attending an elderly woman at risk of a heart attack because of her extremely high blood pressure.

It's easy to forget but coronavirus is not the only medical condition around.

People still suffer strokes, asthma attacks and accidents, but often leave it longer before seeking help because they are afraid of being exposed to the virus in hospital.

We wait in line outside the hospital for two hours, doing our best to keep her comfortable, before heading out on our next call.

A woman battling cancer has collapsed at home. She doesn't remember the fall but refuses our request to take her in. She is terrified she will catch the virus in hospital. I don't blame her.

'Baby has been born' flashes up on the monitor. When we arrive, the mother is cradling her healthy son on the bathroom floor.

I clamp the umbilical cord and allow the father to do the honours. A nice end to the day – even if we finish an hour late.

TUESDAY: I CAN'T EVEN GIVE MY LITTLE BOY A HUG

I'm exhausted yet wake at 4am and clock-watch until I need to get up at 6am. The first two patients are eerily similar: men in their late 40s and early 50s with no underlying health conditions who have rapidly deteriorated ten days after testing positive for coronavirus.

It's the same every time – shortness of breath, fever, cough and extreme lethargy around eight to ten days after a positive test. Their oxygen levels plummet.

Unlike the first wave, when it was mostly elderly people, we are now rushing a lot of younger patients to hospital.

The 45-year-old's young son is still asleep. The man tells his wife not to wake him to say goodbye, refusing to contemplate the very real risk he might never come home.

The 54-year-old's wife is panicked, explaining her husband has never missed a day's work in his life.

I try to reassure her he's in safe hands but it's hard when you are head-to-toe in PPE. We are denied even the humanity of a smile.

That afternoon we attend a young woman who is being sectioned by police under the Mental Health Act for threatening to kill herself.

There are nine ambulances waiting outside the hospital and we are told it will be a minimum of a four-hour wait.

It all has a knock-on effect: the longer we wait outside, the fewer people we can help. Thankfully, we are only there for three hours.

I finish just 45 minutes late. It's a blessing – two weeks ago I worked a run of 15-hour shifts.

As I walk through the door, my 20-month-old son toddles over for a hug. I feel guilty but I've got to avoid him until I've stripped off my uniform, washed it at 60C and had a shower. We spend a blissful 15 minutes together before his bedtime.

WEDNESDAY: NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR ALL PATIENTS

It's my wife's turn to get up at the crack of dawn. She's a part-time A&E nurse so is often treating the very patients I drop off.

We both know there's not enough space for the sheer volume of patients – they just keep coming – and question how long it can continue like this.

I'm on a night shift so spend quality time with my son during the day. Usually my mum will help out but she's shielding as she has diabetes and lung disease.

I haven't seen my parents since last year and I'm terrified they'll catch it before having the vaccine.

My wife returns at 8.45pm, so we have just 15 minutes together before I leave for my shift.

I'm driving a rapid-response vehicle tonight which means I'll be sent out ahead of ambulances for category one cases – the most serious.

THURSDAY: NO AMBULANCE TO DO MY SHIFT IN

It's a quiet start but around 1am I'm dispatched to a cardiac arrest. My adrenaline surges as I fly down rain-slicked streets with my blue lights flashing and siren blaring.

I'm there in minutes but just as I'm donning an FFP3 surgical mask and hazmat suit, I'm stood down. It was a 'Do Not Resuscitate' order and an ambulance is dealing with it. The same thing happens three times that morning.

I seem to spend hours donning and doffing PPE and wiping down surfaces, before returning home to catch some sleep as the sun is rising.

I leave for another night shift at 6.30pm but no ambulance is available as the day crew are stuck in a queue outside a hospital.

When one does arrive, we are immediately dispatched to a 'flagged' address – meaning the caller has a history of abuse to paramedics.

We are on high alert in case things turn nasty but there's no cause to call the police. The patient is suffering abdominal pains but is still, I notice, able to drink four cans of extra-strong lager.

I've been to the next caller's house countless times. He has leg pain but we can't rule out a clot so take him in. Both calls take nearly six hours. It's going to be a long night.

FRIDAY: I THINK OF FOUR MATES KILLED BY THE VIRUS

At 2am we attend a man in his late 30s suffering from a post-Covid cough and chest pain. He says he doesn't want to come in and will call his GP on Monday morning if his symptoms worsen. What if it's too late by then?

Just before 4am, I'm playing midwife again. Another perfect little boy, this time born on the bedroom floor. But just 90 seconds before our shift is due to end we are diverted.

A man in his early 80s has died of a suspected heart attack in his sleep. His distraught wife attempts CPR but I have to tell her it's over. I fill out a Recognition of Life Extinct Form and wait for the police.

On the way back to the station my colleague is quiet. He tells me that he feels there is no end in sight.

I don't reply. There's only so long that you can run on adrenaline.

Most of my colleagues are burnt-out. Four of them have sadly died with the virus and there will probably be more.",'We're now rushing a lot of younger patients into hospital',www.dailymail.co.uk

Commissioner Mah Weng Kwai said the Suhakam Act gave the commission the mandate to make such investigations on its own accord or in response to complaints.

“In other words, we don’t have to wait for a report to be lodged with Suhakam before an inquiry can start,” he told FMT. “As long as an allegation has come to our attention, we can start.”

He said the only time the commission could not do so would be when a matter was already before a judicial inquiry.

“So, if during our inquiry the matter being probed comes up before a court, then by law we have to suspend our inquiry,” he added, citing Section 12 (2) of the Suhakam Act.

M Visvanathan, who leads a group called EDICT (Eliminating Deaths and Abuse in Custody Together), had said earlier that inquiries into allegations of custodial death did not come under Suhakam’s purview.

Responding to Suhakam’s recent release of a report on deaths in police lock-ups and detention centres, Visvanathan said investigations into custodial deaths were solely within the purview and functions of the coroner’s court under the Criminal Procedure Code.

In the case of G Jestus Kevin, who was found dead in a Bentong police station lock-up last year, Suhakam said the victim succumbed to meningoencephalitis (brain inflammation) with multiple blunt force trauma.

Visvanathan, who is a lawyer representing Kevin’s family in an ongoing inquest in Kuantan, said he had sent a letter to the commission.

Another Suhakam commissioner, Jerald Joseph, told FMT the commission’s inquiry into the case ended last April, months before the commencement of the inquest.

It was therefore not in breach of the Suhakam Act, he added.

(AP) – A Pennsylvania woman accused of stealing a laptop from home speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office during the assault on the Capitol will be released from prison, a federal judge decided Thursday.

Judge Martin Carlson of the United States Magistrate ordered that Riley June Williams be released with travel restrictions under her mother’s custody and ordered her to appear in federal court in Washington on Monday to continue her case.

“The seriousness of these violations is great,” Carlson told Williams. “It cannot be stressed enough.”

Williams, 22, of Harrisburg, is charged with theft, obstruction and trespass, as well as violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. Carlson noted that Williams has no criminal record.

Walking with attorney Bryan McQuillan, Riley June Williams will be released from Dauphin County Prison, Thursday, January 21, 2021, in Harrisburg, Pa.

(Dan Gleiter / The Patriot-News via AP)

The FBI says an unknown former Williams romantic partner tipped them off that she appeared in a video of the January 6 riots and the tipster claimed she had hoped to sell the computer to Russian intelligence.

Williams’ attorney, Lori Ulrich, told Carlson that the tipster is an ex-boyfriend who insulted Williams and that “his accusations are exaggerated.”

Video of the riot shows a woman who matches Williams’s description urging intruders to “go up, up, up” during the attack, which momentarily disrupted President Joe Biden’s certification of election victory.

“It is a pity that Mrs. Williams took the bait from the president and entered the Capitol,” Ulrich told the judge.

Williams surrendered on Monday to be charged. She was due to leave Harrisburg prison later Thursday and will be electronically monitored pending trial.

She did not respond to questions when a federal marshal handcuffed her out of the courtroom.

Referring directly to the attack on the Capitol, Carlson said a howling mob tried in vain to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.

“It has been honored by generations of Americans for 232 years,” said Carlson. “It has become so common that we often think very little about it.”

Adding to the theft-related charges on Tuesday, a Virginia-based FBI agent said Williams was recorded on closed-circuit cameras in the Capitol entering and exiting Pelosi’s office.

The agent’s affidavit, in a cellphone video likely taken by Williams, featured a gloved hand of a man lifting an HP laptop from a table, and the caption read, “They’ve got the laptop.”

Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, has said that a laptop used only for presentations has been taken from a conference room. The current location of the computer has not been disclosed in court documents and was not discussed in court on Thursday.

Ulrich said Williams even got a restraining order against the man and changed her phone number – not to evade federal authorities, but to escape the abusive ex.

According to the FBI, the unidentified tipster in the case suggested that Williams planned to sell the laptop to Russia.

“I don’t think it’s as clear as the government makes it in their affidavit of probable cause,” said Ulrich, according to WHP-TV. “There are allegations to be investigated in this case.”

Williams’ ex-boyfriend, Michael Prodanov, declined to comment on The Post on Thursday, except to say he would present evidence “that will disprove her claims.”

Williams acknowledges she was part of a crowd that stormed the Capitol after a fiery speech by then-President Donald Trump before Congress voted to confirm his election loss to Joe Biden.

Ulrich said her client “took the president’s bait” to join the rioters.

Williams was released on Thursday after a hearing before US magistrate judge Martin Carlson in federal court in Harrisburg.

Ulrich did not immediately answer a call for comment.

Weekly new COVID-19 cases were down 20 percent, the lowest number of new cases for a non-holiday week since mid-November, according to the tracking project.



WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- The rates of new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths across the United States are on the decline this week, though some areas are still reporting wrenching death rates, according to a latest report of The COVID Tracking Project.

Weekly new cases were down 20 percent, the lowest number of new cases for a non-holiday week since mid-November, according to the tracking project.

After 16 straight weeks of increases, average weekly hospitalizations dropped 4 percent this week, a modest improvement, but a good sign, said the report.

The number of people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 declined by more than 10 percent from a week ago in 24 states. Hospitalizations are declining or flat in every state but New York, according to the tracking project.

States reported 21,301 COVID-19 deaths this week, the second-highest number of deaths of the pandemic to date.

However, the situation in U.S. long-term care facilities remain alarming. For the second week in a row, long-term care facilities across the nation reported the highest death toll since May last year, more than 7,000 residents and staff, according to the tracking project.

Week-to-week comparisons show new deaths and new cases are on the decline nationwide, according to a ABC News report, citing an internal memo of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Thirty-one states and territories are in a downward trajectory of new cases, according to the memo. Twenty states and territories are in an upward trajectory of new cases while five jurisdictions are at a plateau.

A total of 191,799 new cases and 3,895 deaths were reported across the country on Friday, according to the data updated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Saturday.

California, the most populous state in the United States, once again reported its highest daily rise in COVID-19 deaths at 764 on Friday.

The state, home to around 40 million residents, became the first in the United States to register more than 3 million COVID-19 cases earlier this week.

The United States has recorded more than 24.95 million COVID-19 cases with over 416,700 related deaths as of Saturday afternoon, according to the real-time count kept by Johns Hopkins University.",U.S. key COVID-19 metrics show decline this week,www.bignewsnetwork.com
977,978,https://yourblackworld.net/2021/01/23/congressmans-proposal-requires-mandatory-covid-19-vaccine-before-receiving-1400-stimulus-check/,"In lieu of the underwhelming amount of total COVID-19 vaccines, which have been administered on the U.S. populace, federal government officials are reconvening to come up with ways to substantially increase vaccinations as soon as possible.

According to the Alabama Media Group, a statewide news agency, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives recently conducted a controversial interview with a national financial news source. U.S. House Rep. Steve Sivers (pictured), a Republican from Ohio, believes the new Biden Administration should consider mandating COVID-19 vaccinations.

Rep. Sivers said that receiving a vaccine should be mandatory for all future recipients who will receive $1,400-dollar stimulus checks in the coming months.

“I hope the [Biden] administration will look at [my] option because we actually buy something with our $1,400 — and that’s herd immunity,” Sivers told Yahoo Finance Live.

“The quickest thing we need to do if we really want to help the American people is getting this economy turned back on — get people back to work, get kids back in school, get ourselves some herd immunity, get the vaccine distributed as quickly as we can and get the uptake rate up. That’s why I’d be willing to accept a $1,400 stimulus check if people are willing to take the vaccine.” he continued.

There is bipartisan consensus on Capitol Hill when it comes to this idea. However, on the Democratic side of the aisle in Congress, a U.S. House Representative suggested “incentivizing” rather than mandating.

Late last year, Congressman John Delaney, a Democrat from Maryland, said that increasing stimulus check amounts to $1,500 for verified vaccination recipients is an ideal approach to increasing the number of vaccinations that are administered to the U.S. public. Rep. Delaney’s suggestion also came as he was conducting an interview with a financial news source.

“The faster we get 75% of this country vaccinated, the faster we end COVID and the sooner everything returns to normal. We have to create, in my judgment, an incentive for people to really accelerate their thinking about taking the vaccine,” said Delaney in an exclusive interview with CNBC.

Regardless of either side’s partisan stance on this issue, both proposals violate the public’s right to choose by either not giving citizens a choice or financially influencing their choice in order for the federal government to have its way.

Incoming U.S. President Joe Biden has already revealed details publicly about his forceful commitment to ratcheting up the number of needles stuck into arms.

John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the U.S., laid the foundation of his living and posthumous legacy on a firm establishment of human rights. Protecting consumers was a key benchmark in this chapter of Kennedy’s playbook on responsible government and vigilant citizenship.

There were four basic aspects in the Kennedy-backed U.S. Consumer Bill of Rights:

—The Right to be Informed

—The Right to be Heard

Kennedy further emphasized the importance of these rights during a speech he delivered to the U.S. Congress on March 15, 1962 (now celebrated as the World Consumer Rights Holiday). The former president quoted the following:

“If consumers are offered inferior products, if prices are exorbitant, if drugs are unsafe or worthless, if the consumer is unable to choose on an informed basis, then his dollar is wasted, his health and safety may be threatened, and the national interest suffers.”

However, the real responsibility goes into the enforcement of such rights. The current federal government has much to learn from the present Commander-In-Chief’s late presidential predecessor.","Congressman’s Proposal Requires Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccine Before Receiving $1,400 Stimulus Check",yourblackworld.net

Andrew Martin, founder of #LightsOnLuxembourg, expressed his hope that 'the government will reconsider its decision to open every type of business and leave bars and restaurants closed,' labelling the decision 'not logical and not fair on the Horesca sector.'

From Happy Gilmore to 50 First Dates, it comes as no surprise that Sandler is one of the wealthiest men in the movie business. While audience members have diverse opinions on Sandler’s work, none can deny his overall success. Still, his years on-screen are riddled with “might have been” — movies that could have changed the course of his career and perhaps even have earned him that elusive Oscar nomination.

RELATED: Fans Want a ‘Sandlerverse’ Movie That Unites Adam Sandler’s Films and He Says He’s Interested

Sandler was born a New Yorker and grew up in New Hampshire. He returned to his home state to attend NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts and began taking on small roles before he had even graduated. He caught the eye of Dennis Miller while dabbling in stand-up comedy, whose connections took Sandler’s career to the next level.

Miller presented Sandler to the producer of Saturday Night Live, earning him a five-year stint as a writer for the show. His work on the comedic skits made for a natural transition to humorous movie roles and Sandler was off and running. He held significant roles in seven movies throughout the 90s including The Waterboy, which grossed $186 million from a $20 million budget.

Despite its financial success, The Waterboy still saw many negative reviews — a pattern that would emerge among Sandler films in the coming years. Although Sandler has amassed a strong fan base over the years, many movie-goers are beginning to find his characters and acting style formulaic. This leaves many wondering if Sandler’s loyalty to laughter stifled his career.

Sandler came close to landing many career-defining roles

Sandler has an impressively high output of movies, seeming to always have a new project in the works. It’s understandable that in his nearly four decades of acting, he’s had to make some hard decisions between roles. Casting directors have faced tough choices, as well, with big-budget hits offering them their pick of Hollywood’s top names. As a result, Sandler has come incredibly close to portraying some of cinema’s most iconic characters.

According to Nicki Swift, Sandler was considered for the cast of 2005’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory remake. He would have starred as Willy Wonka, a quirky role that was eventually taken on by Johnny Depp.

Although “aloof chocolatier” doesn’t seem too far out of Sandler’s wheelhouse, some roles were more surprising. ScreenRant reports that Sandler almost starred alongside Tom Cruise in Collateral, though this role ultimately when to Jamie Foxx. While Sandler’s career isn’t completely devoid of dramatic performances, it’s hard to imagine him as a terrified cabbie. Still, the part may have been his chance at an Oscar nomination.

Perhaps most shockingly, Sandler rejected the role of the Bear Jew in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds — a part that was written specifically for him. The incredible success of the film makes it hard not to view this decision as a mistake, but Sandler still seems to be doing just fine.

Sandler’s screen time is far from over

The 54-year-old actor seems to be expertly adapting to the viewing tastes of fans. In the past years, he’s had many full-length projects released in partnership with Netflix, including Sandy Wexler and Murder Mystery. The success of the latter earned Sandler an additional four-film deal with the company, according to The Verge.

It would appear that Hollywood’s most polarizing comedy star isn’t leaving the screen any time soon.","Adam Sandler's Life Would Be Totally Different If He Hadn't Turned Down Roles in 'Collateral,' 'Inglourious Basterds,' and More",www.cheatsheet.com
980,981,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2021/01/24/how-to-start-a-reading-habit-and-stick-to-it/,"If there is a sure way to achieve more career success, it’s reading. If there is a single habit to keep you content, it’s reading.

Yet, we neglect reading because scrolling Facebook seems more entertaining.

If you have time to browse the Internet, you will surely have time for actual reading. What you read and how you read directly affect your personal growth – especially your career.

It’s time to cultivate a reading habit that will change your life for the better. Here’s a practical guide to help you get started.

Find a purpose: why do you want to read?

Besides the fact that reading is essential to your career growth, what else motivates you to read? With a more personal (and concise) purpose to pick up the reading habit, you will be more likely to stick to it.

You need to identify the possible results that you want to achieve from reading in order to set up a reading plan.

Is it to have a discussion about an interesting subject with your peers at work? Is it to write your own reviews of the book?

Or is it simply to share a quick takeaway from an article on your LinkedIn profile? Whatever it is, incorporating consistent activities after reading is the key to developing the habit.

Start small: read every day, one article at a time

For those who rarely pick up a new book every now and then, it is best to start consuming online content before committing to a concrete reading list. You can choose to read anything that matches your preferences.

Choose a good content site to subscribe to and start reading their fresh articles to kick-off your day instead of running through all your social media accounts.

While there are millions of websites worth checking out, save your time by visiting news and content aggregators like Flipboard, Medium or LinkedIn Pulse.

You can literally search for the most-read articles of your preferred topics, from business updates, trending news, latest innovations to self-help articles – everything you need to cultivate a reading habit is right at your fingertips!

Learn to read: make the most of your reading

One of the reasons why people dislike reading is because they get bored of the words easily. In order to read more, one must learn how to enjoy reading first.

Any book or article can be as fascinating as Harry Potter as long as you immerse yourself in it.

Don’t just read to acknowledge, read to understand. Imagine yourself having a conversation with the author about the subject matter, interpret what he or she is trying to convey in every sentence, analyse the points given, and then ask yourself questions to justify the message.

With a more personal approach, anything that you read is “filtered” to reflect your own perception of certain things. Over time, you will find reading more pleasant as you learn how to read with both your heart and mind.

The trick to reading more books is to read only a number of pages in a day, and usually, a 30-minute read every day is all it takes to complete a book within weeks. But first things first, you need to curate a reading list that works for you.

The easiest way is to seek recommendations from your friends or even strangers.

From Google search, Quora posts to Online Book Clubs, you can look up countless worthy titles to indulge in throughout the year.

You can categorise the genres for each month to ensure the diversity of your “library” (also to keep your mind fresh).

Depending on the length of the book, you can schedule your reading time appropriately. You can test your average reading speed here.

Don’t forget to carry a book (paper or digital) wherever you go so that you wouldn’t waste any second reading. Try to also apply critical reading skills while reading books as well.

Unwind and reflect: take a break after each book

No one is keeping score of your reading habit; so don’t force yourself to read as many books as possible.

After finishing one book, allow yourself to take some time off before picking up the next one (while still maintaining the regular website content consumption).

Try sharing your favourite parts (or quotes) from the book on social media sites, or even blog about it so that more people will be inspired to read.

As you learn more from each time you read, the habit of reading will surely stay without any agenda needed.

There are an estimated 250 eagle hunters in the area, which is located in the Altai Mountains in western Mongolia and takes five years to finish training with eagles to become an eagle hunter or berkutchi.

With the younger generation moving away to cities and preferring the comforts of modern living, the modern Kazakh eagle hunters are a dying breed. Despite this, many eagle hunters still pass on their skills to their sons and daughters.

Zay Yar, a 36-year-old photographer, spent some time in western Mongolia documenting the life of these incredible people, capturing their traditions as the tribe hunt on horseback and care for their eagles.

Zay, from Mayanmar, says: “I'm interested in the culture of eagle hunters. How they live, how they train and hunt with their golden eagles and how this tradition is going on. I was happy and amazed to meet these wonderful people and their ancient tradition.

“The images represent the culture of eagle hunting and how the tradition is being passed to young eagle hunters.”

Governor Narong Woonciew said the decision to ease Covid-19 restrictions for visitors travelling from Bangkok and Samut Prakan, two provinces with high infection rates, follows calls from the business community seeking to lure visitors to Phuket.

On Friday, Phuket businesses met provincial authorities and proposed an end to the mandatory quarantine period for people travelling from certain high-risk areas in hope of stimulating the tourism industry as Chinese New Year is approaching.

The cabinet has recently approved eight special holidays for this year, including Feb 12 for Chinese New Year.

Phuket has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic due to the absence of foreign tourist arrivals. The strict precautions, which were introduced after a fresh round of the outbreak, have kept local visitors away.

Kongsak Khoopongsakorn, president of the association of Thai hotels in the southern region, said the business operators urged the provincial authorities to ease some Covid-19 restrictions to allow the local economy some room to breathe.

""The private sector was asking for a relaxation [of the rule] because the economy is stagnant. The 14-day quarantine [requirement] for people from at-risk areas is tantamount to a lockdown of the province,"" he said.

Sarayuth Mallum, president of the Phuket travel industry council, however, said strict disease control measures remain necessary to protect local people and tourists from contracting the virus.

Dr Thanit Sermkaew, chief of the provincial public health office, said health volunteers will be told of the latest easing of restrictions while stressing that all visitors must register on gophuget.com ahead of their visits.

A video advertising the main event featuring Eminem’s music made the rounds on social media, after being posted by both the UFC and the rapper himself.

However, Eminem appeared to have beef with UFC president Dana White during a joint interview on ESPN SportsCenter.

‘Slim Shady’ took shots at White telling the veteran MMA promoter his opinion does not matter before cursing him out and exiting the interview.

“The best part about your opinion is that it doesn’t matter. And if every fighter that you had listened to your opinion when you doubted them, you wouldn’t have a f*cking league. So, you’re an assh*le and I’m out.”

In an interview with Farah Hannoun, White seemed unfazed by the altercation and suggested all is not what it seems.

“Yeah,” White said with a smirk. “There’s something going on. You’ll have to wait and see.”

Eminem dropped the music video for his new single “Higher” today. In the video, the full footage of the rapper’s interaction with White is played and shows that the confusing diss was all just for fun. It appears White was trying to drum up even more interest in UFC 257 by engineering a fake beef between him and the rap superstar.

In the UFC 257 main event, former dual weight UFC champion Conor McGregor will look to propel himself back into title contention when he takes on Dustin ‘The Diamond’ Poirier.

As he held her hand, he reflected on the ordeal his mother went through when she left the royal family.“I’m just really relieved and happy to be sitting here talking to you with my wife by my side,” he said. “Because I can’t imagine what it must have been like for her [Diana], going through this process by herself all those years ago.“It’s been unbelievably tough for the two of us, but at least we had each other.”In a second clip Winfrey said to Meghan that no subject was off limits and at one point tells the couple “you have said some pretty shocking things here.” Oprah also asks Meghan if she was “silent or silenced.”Winfrey appeared to reference a comment made by Meghan when she said that the trolling she received was “almost unsurvivable.”The conversation was flagged as the first TV interview to be given by the couple since they made California their home last year, but Harry rather spoiled Winfrey’s exclusive when he taped an open air bus-top interview with another old friend, James Corden, which was broadcast last week. Prince Harry Tells Friend James Corden He Left the Royal Family Because It Was Destroying His Mental HealthIn that interview, Harry said he was more concerned about the intrusions of the media into his family’s life than the Netflix show The Crown, which he said was “obviously fiction.” His friend Corden did not ask whether Harry’s sympathetic attitude to the show was influenced by the reported $100m fee the couple have received from Netflix to produce content.Harry told Corden that the British press created a “difficult environment” that was destroying his mental health but insisted he “didn’t walk away” from the royal family. “It was stepping back rather than stepping down.”He said: “I did what any husband, what any father would do. It’s like: ‘I need to get my family out of here.’ But we never walked away.” He added: “I will never walk away. I will always be contributing.”The spate of interviews come after Buckingham Palace announced the couple would not be returning to their former roles as working members of the royal family.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

987,988,https://www.salon.com/2021/01/23/the-uncanny-genius-of-walking-on-thin-ice-yoko-ono-and-john-lennons-poignant-final-collaboration/,"Along with ""Give Peace a Chance"" and ""Imagine,"" ""Walking on Thin Ice"" holds a vaunted place among the collaborative works of John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Indeed, it would be the final, poignant act in the story of their remarkable artistic association.

Composed by Ono, ""Walking on Thin Ice"" began to take shape for Yoko during one of the Lennons' car trips between their estate in Cold Spring Harbor and New York City's Dakota apartment building. After writing the song's ethereal lyrics, Yoko challenged herself to concoct an ambitious new sound to bring the composition's music to fruition. ""I wanted to push it a little further, experimentally,"" she later recalled. ""So I was thinking about Alban Berg, in one of his operas, you know, where a drunk is going 'ahaahaahaa.' Just sort of saying things, but in such a way that the emphasis is all wrong, distorted"" (Madeline Bocaro, ""Just a Story: 'Walking On Thin Ice,'"" December 8, 2016).

""Walking on Thin Ice"" was originally attempted during Lennon and Ono's August 1980 recording sessions at the Hit Factory. Recorded in seven takes, the song featured some wicked guitar runs from Earl Slick, backed by Tony Levin's galloping bass and Yoko's dance-club vocal turn. After one of the takes, John suggested that guitarist Hugh McCracken restrict his playing to the backbeats. ""That's great, really funky,"" said Yoko, and the guitarist tried out the new playing style.

For his part, John was jazzed about Yoko and the band's progress on the song, which was still relatively simple at this juncture, save for Slick's ambient guitar sounds. When Yoko and the group finished the last take, John couldn't wait for her to join him in the control booth for the playback. ""Come and listen before I break your neck!"" he said to his wife, anxious for her to hear what he had been experiencing in the booth with producer Jack Douglas. After they listened to the most recent run-through, John couldn't contain himself any longer. ""I think you just cut your first number one, Yoko,"" he announced, borrowing the phraseology, if not the intuition, of George Martin's proclamation to the Beatles nearly 18 years earlier. On that day back in November 1962 at EMI's Abbey Road Studios, Martin activated the studio PA and announced, ""Gentlemen, you've just made your first number-one record"" after witnessing the band's performance of ""Please Please Me"" (George Martin with Jeremy Hornsby, ""All You Need Is Ears,"" 1979).

But for all of the Lennons' excitement, ""Walking on Thin Ice"" didn't make the final cut for their November 1980 ""Double Fantasy"" album release. Undeterred, John and Yoko returned to the studio — in this case, New York City's Record Plant — during the first week in December. ""We're going back. Again. I feel like I just don't want to leave the studio,"" John told Douglas. ""Just you and me and Yoko. That's all I want. Get an assistant, get an engineer, and produce"" (Ben Yakas, ""Record Producer Jack Douglas Opens Up about Working with John Lennon,"" Gothamist, July 18, 2016).

Douglas met the Lennons in a small 10th-floor studio, where they began hatching plans to remake ""Walking on Thin Ice."" As Douglas later recalled, ""We only had a germ of that record, so we made a loop of I think eight bars. It's just loop-based. And a loop then was just a tape machine, I had it on a two-track spinning back to a multitrack, cutting bars together."" With the tape loop in place, Jack and John were able to begin overdubbing voices and instruments to the song. On that first night back in the studio, Yoko remade her lead vocal, while also recording a spoken-word middle section: ""I knew a girl who tried to walk across the lake,"" she said in an intentionally nonchalant, even disconnected voice. ""'Course it was winter, when all this was ice."" As Jack remembered, ""Yoko was great,"" and her poetic interlude was the turning point for the song. ""John knew that Yoko was onto something with that one — especially with that spoken-word"" (Yakas).

On Thursday, December 4, John enjoyed one of the finest moments of his storied career when he overdubbed a sizzling guitar part onto ""Walking on Thin Ice."" When it came to the guitar that John used, Jack didn't have any doubt about the instrument's identity. ""It was the Capri,"" he recalled, referring to John's fabled 1958 Rickenbacker 325, the very instrument that Lennon had played on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" back in February 1964. For the solo, John simply wailed on the guitar, executing a series of power chords as Douglas, sitting nearby, reached over and worked the instrument's Bigsby tailpiece. As with a whammy bar, the Bigsby tremolo arm allowed the producer to manipulate the vibrato sound and heighten the eerie ambience they had been creating for ""Walking on Thin Ice"" (author's interview with Douglas, August 2018).

By Monday, December 8, the song had evolved into a discothèque-friendly six-minute opus, complete with Yoko's eerie vocal sound effects, spoken-word poem, and Lennon's seering guitar solo. John was ecstatic as he listened to the mix in all of its glory. ""From now on,"" he told Yoko, ""we're just gonna do this. It's great!"" — adding that ""this is the direction!"" After listening to the latest mix of ""Walking on Thin Ice"" with record executive David Geffen, the couple agreed to release it after the Christmas holidays to allow for a full media blitz (Ken Sharp, ""Starting Over,"" 2010).

As history well knows, John wouldn't live to see the song's 1981 release. But as he had predicted, ""Walking on Thin Ice"" eventually topped the charts. Following through on the couple's plans, Yoko released the single in February 1981. ""Getting this together after what happened was hard,"" Yoko wrote in the liner notes. ""But I knew John would not rest his mind if I hadn't. I hope you like it, John. I did my best."" In its initial pass at the Billboard charts, ""Walking on Thin Ice' landed a number-58 showing. But even more impressively, it fell into heavy rotation in the dance clubs. But the song's fate hadn't been sealed just yet. In the new century, ""Walking on Thin Ice"" enjoyed new life through a series of dance club remixes and cover versions by the likes of the Pet Shop Boys. And in 2003, John's prophecy came true when the track notched the number-one spot on the US Hot Dance Club charts.","The uncanny genius of ""Walking on Thin Ice,"" Yoko Ono and John Lennon's poignant final collaboration",www.salon.com

The 48-year-old Cruel Intentions actress was seen tenderly placing her head into Carlson's chest as they socially-distanced from fellow patrons outside a brick and mortar store.

Later on during their couple's outing, Selma locked arms with Ron to enjoy a leisurely stroll down the sidewalk.

Blair was seen wearing a black shirt underneath knitted cardigan sweater worn to keep her nice and cozy in the unusually cold Southern California weather.

She contrasted her top with a set of light brown jeans that had been partially cuffed at the bottom along with a pair of black leather boots.

Her short brunette hair was allowed to stay loose for the shopping trip.

Carlson wore a plaid button-up shirt underneath a sleeveless hooded puffy jacket in addition to a pair of tan shoes and a set of blue jeans.

He also wore a beanie to ensure that his head stayed warm in the downpour.

The couple both wore facial coverings to reduce the chances of contracting COVID-19 during their shopping trip.

Blair and Carlson have had an on-again off-again relationship over the past few years, and it appears that the two are currently enjoying each other's company.

In 2018, the Legally Blonde actress announced that she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and Carlson has apparently been instrumental in lifting her spirits since then.

In January of last year, the actress made a post to her Instagram account to commemorate her relationship with Carlson and express her love for him.

She partially wrote in the caption for the photo: 'This is the person I want to lean on as well as hold up. For good.'

The actress was previously married to musician Ahmet Zappa from 2004 until 2006 and was also linked to her Kath And Kim costar Mikey Day.

In 2011, she welcomed a son with fashion designer Jason Bleick; the two were in a relationship from 2010 until 2012.",Selma Blair shares a tender moment with beau Ron Carlson in LA,www.dailymail.co.uk

The Yamhill County Sheriff’s Office has identified her as Mariah Diane Lindgren, 31, of Humbolt County, California.

According to the YCSO, Lindgren had been seen in the Grand Ronde and Willamina areas in recent weeks.

Capt. Chris Ray said her remains were found about 9 a.m. by a citizen, who reported a suspicious object at the entrance to the park. Deputies responded and soon requested the agency’s Special Investigations Unit, which then identified the contents in the object as remains.

The remains were taken to the Oregon State Medical Examiner’s Office, which the following day confirmed they were from an adult female who was later identified as Lindgren.

The Oregon State Police and the West Valley Fire District assisted with the case.

The YCSO is asking anyone who may have had contact with Lindgren or who noticed suspicious activity in the area of the park to contact the sheriff’s office at 503-434-7506.

Ray said his office hopes to release more information later this week to possibly include a cause and manner of death and how the victim was identified.",Woman's remains found at Stuart Grenfell Park,newsregister.com
990,991,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2021-01-23/arizona-republicans-reelect-fervent-trump-ally-as-chair,"Arizona Republicans voted Saturday to censure Cindy McCain and two prominent GOP officials who have found themselves crosswise with former President Donald Trump.

The censures of Sen. John McCain’s widow, former Sen. Jeff Flake and Gov. Doug Ducey are merely symbolic. But they show the party’s foot soldiers are focused on enforcing loyalty to Trump, even in the wake of an election that saw Arizona inch away from its staunchly Republican roots.

Party activists also reelected controversial Chairwoman Kelli Ward, who has been one of Trump’s most unflinching supporters and among the most prolific promoters of his baseless allegations of election fraud.

The Arizona GOP’s combative focus has delighted Trump’s staunchest supporters and worried Republican insiders who have watched the party lose ground in the suburbs as the influence of its traditional conservative establishment has faded in favor of Trump. A growing electorate of young Latinos and newcomers bringing their more liberal politics from back home have further hurt the GOP.

“This is a time for choosing for Republicans. Are we going to be the conservative party?” said Kirk Adams, a former state House speaker and chief of staff to Ducey. “Or is this a party ... that’s loyal to a single person?”

It’s a question of Republican identity that party officials and activists are facing across the country following Trump’s 2020 loss, and particularly after a mob of his supporters laid siege on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

Nowhere is the question more acute than Arizona, where the state GOP’s unflinching loyalty to Trump stands out even in a party that’s been remade everywhere in the image of the former president.

Ward has relentlessly — but unsuccessfully — sued to overturn the election results. The party has used its social media accounts to urge followers to fight and perhaps even to die in support of Trump’s false claims of victory. Two of the state’s four Republican congressmen are accused of playing a role in organizing the Jan. 6 rally that turned violent.

After dominating Arizona politics for decades, Republicans now find themselves on their heels in the state’s highest offices. President Joe Biden narrowly eked out a victory here, becoming just the second Democrat in more than five decades to win the state. Consecutive victories in 2018 and 2020 gave Democrats control of both U.S. Senate seats for the first time in nearly 70 years.

Ward, a physician and former state legislator who lost two Republican primaries for the U.S. Senate, defeated three challengers to win a second term.

In a brief interview, Ward acknowledged “disappointment at the top of the ticket” but said she and many other Republicans still question the results showing victories for Biden and Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. Judges have rejected eight lawsuits challenging Arizona’s election results.

Ward pointed to GOP successes down the ballot, noting Republicans defied expectations in local races.

Ward said she’s a “Trump Republican” who will “always put America first, who believes in faith, family and freedom.” The way forward for the GOP, she said, is keeping Trump’s 74 million voters engaged.

“Yes, I will be radical about those things because those are the things that keep this country great,” Ward said. “The people who are complaining are the people who actually put us in this spot where we are in Arizona, people who have been mamby pamby, lie down and allow the Democrats to walk all over them.”

The censures target some of Arizona’s most prominent Republicans,

Cindy McCain endorsed Biden and became a powerful surrogate for the Democrat following years of attacks by Trump on her husband.

“Maybe (Ward) should be reminded that my husband never lost an Arizona election since his first win in 1982,” McCain said in a statement before the vote.

Flake was one of the few congressional Republicans who was openly critical of Trump for failing to adhere to conservative values. He declined to run for reelection in 2018 and endorsed Biden in last year’s election.

“If condoning the President’s behavior is required to stay in the Party’s good graces, I’m just fine being on the outs,” Flake wrote on Twitter before the vote.

Ducey is being targeted for his restrictions on individuals and businesses to contain the spread of COVID-19. While it’s not mentioned in the proposed censure, he had a high-profile break with the president when he signed the certification of Biden’s victory.

“These resolutions are of no consequence whatsoever and the people behind them have lost whatever little moral authority they may have once had,” said Sara Mueller, Ducey’s political director.

Many traditional conservatives fret that the censures and Ward’s combative style turn off the swing voters and ticket-splitters who handed Democrats their recent victories. But they say the party’s decisions will reflect only the views of about 1,500 committed activists.

John McCain was censured by the state GOP in 2014 and went on to comfortably win a Republican primary over Ward and a general election. The self-described maverick, known best for his willingness to buck his party, had strained relations with the state party for much of his career but was consistently reelected by wide margins.","Arizona Republicans censure Cindy McCain, GOP governor",www.sandiegouniontribune.com

992,993,https://news.emory.edu/features/2021/01/arts-and-social-justice/,"In the wake of nationwide protests over the killing of unarmed Black people, Emory senior Liz Greene found herself researching a historic tragedy with a strong contemporary resonance.

Before last year, Greene had never heard of the 1906 Atlanta race massacre — a bloody uprising sparked by inflammatory claims that sent nearly 5,000 white men rioting through downtown Atlanta, vandalizing Black-owned businesses and hanging, stabbing, bludgeoning and shooting Black residents. At the end of the three-day melee, 25 Black Atlantans were dead and hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed. None of the killers were convicted.

“It was very powerful and felt very relevant — a reminder that people have been fighting against these injustices for a long time and still have a long way to go,” she acknowledges.

But for Greene and others enrolled in Emory’s Georgia Civil Rights Cold Cases course last semester, the deadly uprising would become much more than a grim footnote in Atlanta history.

Working with award-winning journalist Hank Klibanoff, a professor of practice in Emory’s Creative Writing Program, and Emory alumnus Garrett Turner, a professional actor and playwright, 16 students found themselves imagining the untold human stories of the victims and participants.

The collaboration was part of Emory’s new Arts and Social Justice Fellows program, which brings together Emory students and faculty members with Atlanta artists to explore how creative thinking and expression can inspire change.

In the cold cases course, students developed creative projects that gave voice to the past, writing dramatic monologues, dialogues and poems that were performed by professional actors via Zoom and recorded.

“The result was astonishing,” says Turner, who enjoyed the challenge of coaxing creativity from students who didn’t necessarily identify as artists. “We were asking them to write a scene from a play using particularly complex and heavy source material, and they took it on bravely.”

Beyond the student experience, “our hope is that those personal, intimate moments will help humanize the victims and present a much more complete view of the scope and the impact of those fateful days in Atlanta,” Klibanoff says.

In their dramatic vignettes, he saw students reacting “not just to the horrors of 1906, but also to the horrors of 2020,” including the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and Ahmaud Arbery.

“I think they saw this as a chance to channel their response,” Klibanoff adds.",Arts & Social Justice,news.emory.edu
993,994,https://www.newdelhitimes.com/florida-governor-walks-back-claim-over-1-millionth-shot/,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had a made-for-TV moment: A 100-year-old World War II veteran getting a vaccine against the coronavirus. “An American hero,” the governor proclaimed Friday, would be the 1 millionth senior in his state to get a lifesaving shot in the arm.

As it turned out, the assertion was premature, and the Republican governor later walked back the claim, saying instead that the injection was symbolic of the state being on track to hit 1 million doses soon.

State officials acknowledged that it could take a few more days to reach the milestone. DeSantis’ own health department reported that, as of Thursday, fewer than 840,000 seniors had received the shot.

The governor’s misstep came as Florida’s congressional Democrats, in a letter to DeSantis, expressed “serious concerns with the state’s rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine,” even as DeSantis has barnstormed the state in recent days to announce the expansion of vaccination sites.

The Democrats said more than 1 million unused vaccines were “on hold” in Florida, suggesting the state was not expeditiously administering them.

The letter chided the governor for confusing and misleading the public on vaccine distribution and availability, citing “a perception of unfairness and political motivation.” Democrats also faulted him and his administration for the delay in establishing a statewide system to schedule vaccination appointments.

State officials had no immediate comment on any of those assertions.

Earlier this week, the Florida Health Department expanded a new telephone appointment system meant to help counties better handle the demand for vaccines, but state officials pleaded with the public to be patient. The pilot program was rolled out in Miami-Dade County last week and then expanded to some of the state’s largest counties — Broward, Duval, Hillsborough and Lee.

Some hospitals, county health departments and vaccination centers were plunged into chaos after DeSantis announced last month that he would open the vaccines to seniors 65 and older, prompting long lines, crashed websites and disappointment among thousands of Floridians.

During a legislative hearing earlier this month, the state’s director of emergency management, Jared Moskowitz, acknowledged the “chaotic” environment spawned by the release of two vaccines approved by the federal government.

DeSantis himself has urged Floridians to remain patient as the state awaits more vaccine supplies.

The governor, who has yet to make it official that he will seek reelection in 2022, has tried to cast himself in an aggressive posture against the coronavirus, touting that his state has vaccinated more seniors than any other state.

That messaging may have taken a hit when he appeared Friday on Fox News with World War II veteran Henry Sayler, who got a shot in the arm on national cable news.

“He’s a hundred years old, and he’s got the opportunity now to get the vaccine, so we’re excited,” the governor said during the live broadcast. “And we do believe this is the 1 millionth senior, which the reporting will bear out over the next couple of days.”

Reporters soon began asking about that figure because it did not appear to line up with reported vaccinations so far. DeSantis’ office sent out a news release clarifying that the shot was symbolic of nearing the goal of 1 million.

“It’s all about his PR and promotion of himself in stark contrast to what is happening in the state of Florida,” said state Sen. Gary Farmer, the top Democrat in his chamber. “He’s running around the state giving false hope to seniors and other people.”

DeSantis said later at a news conference that there’s a lag time in reporting the number of shots administered.

“We’re 800-some thousand that’s been reported as of midnight last night,” DeSantis said. “We really believe that in a few more days as the reports come in, we will actually cross 1 million 65 and up that will have gotten shots.”

Florida has recorded more than 1.6 million COVID-19 infections and over 25,400 deaths. On Friday, health officials reported 277 new deaths, matching the Aug. 11 record for the highest single-day toll since the pandemic began.

But hospitalization figures have begun ticking downward. There were 6,911 people being treated for the disease in the state’s hospitals, according to an online census of hospitals — the first time that figure was below 7,000 for more than two weeks.

The current winter outbreak is the state’s third major wave of infections since last March, with the worst coming last summer. Nearly 10,000 people were hospitalized with coronavirus at the height of Florida’s summer wave.",Florida governor walks back claim over 1 millionth shot - - India's Only International Newspaper,www.newdelhitimes.com

995,996,https://www.kpax.com/news/montana-news/montana-lawmakers-hear-bill-that-would-change-rules-for-public-employee-union-fees,"HELENA — Montana lawmakers held a hearing Friday on a bill that would change the state’s laws on how public employee unions collect dues.

The House Business and Labor Committee heard testimony on House Bill 168, sponsored by Republican Rep. Bill Mercer of Billings.

The bill would require public employers to give employees a form each year, telling them they have the right not to participate in a union and asking whether they are willing to waive that right. If an employee signed that form, the employer would deduct union dues from their paycheck. Someone not signing would be interpreted as a decision to disassociate from the union, and dues could not be deducted from their check.

Mercer said the change was needed to bring Montana in line with the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2018 decision in the case Janus v. AFSCME. The court ruled public-sector employees who choose not to join a union can’t be forced to pay any fees to the union. Prior to that decision, unions could charge an “agency fee” to unaffiliated employees who were also affected by their negotiations.

Mercer said the court’s decision made clear that an employee should have to give explicit consent before a union could collect a fee from them.

“When the United States Supreme Court is interpreting the United States Constitution, and it makes a determination that, in order to be constitutionally viable, a state or a local government must do something, that isn’t advisory, that isn’t best practices – that is a constitutional mandate,” he said.

He argued asking an employee for consent only once isn’t sufficient.

However, HB 168 drew opposition from a number of union representatives, who said it went farther than what is required by the Janus decision. They said courts have since held that the type of waiver proposed in the bill wouldn’t be necessary.

Amanda Curtis is president of the Montana Federation of Public Employees, which represents the largest group of employees affected by the bill. She said she was concerned about a provision in the bill that would change language in state law, referring to a union as the “exclusive representative” only for its members. She argued that would eliminate the principle that the union negotiates for all employees, including those who aren't members.

“By meddling in that collaborative relationship between the employer and employees in Section 5, this bill will create uncertainty for both sides – the employer and the employee – in every public workplace,” Curtis said.

HB 168 is only the first bill to be heard on this subject. Republican Sen. Keith Regier of Kalispell is sponsoring a similar bill, Senate Bill 89, which has not yet had its first hearing. Union representatives also said Friday that they expected another bill that would only include what they see as the required changes to comply with the Janus decision.",Montana lawmakers hear bill that would change rules for public employee union fees,www.kpax.com
996,997,https://www.compsmag.com/news/phones/man-arrested-for-alleged-aggravated-assault-standoff-with-swat-in-mobile-home/,"News Highlights: Man arrested for alleged aggravated assault, standoff with SWAT in mobile home.

Salt Lake City police have arrested a man accused of aggravated assault and barricaded himself in a mobile home on Friday morning.

According to statements of the likely cause, the three victims were in their car in front of their apartment at 2:15 a.m. when Jacob Mills, 32, reportedly opened the door of their vehicle and punched one of the victims in the face. A victim then said that Mills took out a silver revolver gun and said, “Sewers get stitches.”

One of the victims told police that Mills used to live in the apartment below and that he had “bullied” the neighborhood. The victim told police that Mills was currently living in a mobile home parked in Shannon Circle.

Officers approached the mobile home and called for the residents to get out of the house. The residents refused to go outside, but opened the door enough to identify Mills and his wife inside, statements said. Mills refused to leave the mobile home, but police took his wife out of the area for her safety when she walked out. His wife repeatedly made spontaneous statements to the police related to an incident in which one of the victims was involved in the sexual assault.

Police called a SWAT team because Mills refused to leave the RV. Mills surrendered to authorities and was taken into custody after hours of a SWAT stalemate and negotiators. At one point during the stalemate, Mills was seen throwing a gun out the door of the RV. The gun matched the description of the gun that victims say was aimed at them perfectly, according to PC statements.

Officers interviewed Mills, who admitted that he had confronted the victims in the vehicle because he believed they were “trying to break into his RV before” and admitted that he punched one of the victims in the face. He told police that he took out the gun and aimed it at the other victim because the victim pulled out a knife during the altercation. When asked why Mills didn’t call the police instead of confronting the victims, he replied that it was because “the police never do anything”.

According to PC statements, Mills also told police that he was addicted to heroin and used it on a daily basis to combat the pain of a previous injury. When the police confronted him about the illegality of possession of a firearm, he replied that the weapon was only holding for his wife. He told police he purchased the gun from the Utah Gun Exchange about two weeks before the incident.

Mills is charged with aggravated assault, possession of a weapon by a restricted person and obstruction of justice. According to statements, the victims were initially reluctant to provide information to the police because they were “extremely afraid for their lives” and told the police, “He will now kill us. We are dead.” Statements say Mills is familiar with the victims’ whereabouts and “appears to have a violent criminal history as recently as several months ago.”

Individuals charged in complaints are presumed innocent unless or until their guilt is proven beyond a reasonable doubt in court.

(WTVY) - Vice President Kamala Harris is probably still learning her way around her new home and office, but letters from girls inspired by her historical achievements are already on the way to the White House mailbox.

Congratulations on being the first female African American to be sworn into office. I know the road has been very crazy and like a rollercoaster, but you did something a lot of people said couldn’t be done. I would like to thank you for showing young black girls like me that anything is possible if you set your mind to it. You’re my role model. Thank you again and may God bless along the rest of the way,” reads Makayla’s letter.

For Girls Inc’s staff whose mission is to inspire girls to be strong smart and bold, Makayla’s words are proof that representation matters.

“For the young girls at Girls Inc to see not only a woman but an African American woman it was really important and confirms what we teach here,” says Girls Inc program director Mary Beth Bigham.

Other black girls, they probably think that they can’t do this, or they can’t do that because they are black, but she showed and proved that anything can be done with a black person,” says Makayla.","Dothan girl writes letter to Kamala Harris, “You are my role model”",www.waff.com

The 56-year-old, who returned to New Zealand on Dec. 30, tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 days after leaving a two-week mandatory quarantine at the border where she had twice tested negative.

“We are working under the assumptions that this is a positive case and that it is a more transmissible variant, either the one identified first in South Africa or the UK, or potentially Brazil - or another transmissible variant,” Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield told a news conference.

It is not known how the woman was infected or whether the infection is new, Bloomfield said. But since the woman tested positive several days after being released from quarantine and has been at home, the authorities are treating it as a “probable community case”.

New Zealand, one of the most successful developed nations in controlling the spread of the pandemic, last recorded a community coronavirus transmission on Nov. 18, according to the Health Ministry website.

A tough lockdown and geographical isolation helped New Zealand virtually eliminate the novel coronavirus within its borders.

The country of 5 million people has had only 1,927 confirmed cases. But with the pandemic raging globally, more people are returning to New Zealand with infections, including the new variants, raising concerns the virus may spread in the community again.

The woman, who lives in Northland on New Zealand’s North Island, quarantined upon arrival in a managed isolation facility in Auckland where several the highly virulent COVID-19 cases have been recorded in recent weeks, Bloomfield said.

“This is a reminder to all of us that the pandemic continues and that this is a tricky virus,” he said.

Social media users rushed to express concern and frustration about the new case, with one user describing the reactions on Twitter as a “collective groan”.

On Sunday, there were eight new infections, all returning travellers quarantined at the border, bringing active cases among those quarantined to 79, the ministry said in a statement.

Pressure has been mounting on Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s government to vaccinate the population, but New Zealand has said the majority of its population would only be vaccinated in the second half of the year.",New Zealand probes first 'probable' community COVID-19 case in months,www.reuters.com

 HE is just 16 years old and is very much unassuming, yet he exhibits both leadership and intelligence attributes.

The 2020 child president Mukudzeishe Madzivire raised the Christian Brothers College (CBC) flag high when he attained 10 As at Ordinary level Cambridge examinations last year. Mukudzeishe, who is now doing form five at CBC could not hide his excitement.

“When l collected my results on Tuesday 19 January, I was quite surprised and a bit overwhelmed and l did not expect to get the results that l got, and l think there is never anyone who expected to get such results so I was very happy,” said Mukudzeishe.

Mukudzeishe, who is doing Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and English at Advanced level wishes to further pursue his studies at tertiary level and study either public health or medicine. At O level, he wrote Business Studies, Accounting, Geography, History, Literature in English, Computer Science, English, Mathematics, Biology and Physical Science.

“I’m very interested in the social, economic and political factors that contribute to the provision of healthcare and the Covid-19 pandemic has opened my eyes to the reality of modern healthcare as being a social service whose provision is impeded by rampant inequalities. I’d like to work in fields related to that or perhaps on the field as a medical practitioner,” he added.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic effects, Mukudzeishe is the acting child president as a new presidium has not been elected. He entered the junior parliament as a junior president in June 2019 and his term ended in June 2020.

 Mukudzeishe said being in the junior parliament was a life changing experience for him that presented many opportunities.

“I got the opportunity to interact with people from different backgrounds, different communities, and for the betterment of the welfare of Zimbabwe I worked in various programmes.”

Among other programmes Mukudzeishe said they managed to successfully carry out the ‘We Write 2020’, a short story writing competition, a pad drive where they donated female hygiene products to primary and secondary students from disadvantaged communities, and the 4-H Zimbabwe Foundation debate jam in Bulawayo where 12 schools took part to discuss topics such as the new curriculum, command agriculture, climate change, issues affecting children at schools.

Mukudzeishe is a writer, pianist, poet, model and vocalist. So far, he has published two books titled Inscriptions and By the Still Waters.

His father, Mr Resmond Madzivire said; “I’m so much impressed but still in shock as well. Mukudzeishe did not get much time to do his school work last year as he was travelling a lot to fulfill his child presidential duties, as he even travelled as far as the UK in February last year. Reality hasn’t dawned on me yet but I’m one of the happiest parents right now,” said Mr Madzivire.

Another CBC student, Jewel Chenai Damunesa, also scored ten As in the 2020 Cambridge examinations. He sat for Geography, History, Literature in English, Computer Science, English, French, IsiZulu, Mathematics, Biology and Physical science. He has also proceeded to A level at the same school.

The CBC headmaster, Mr Kizito Muhomba, congratulated the 2020 O’ level and A’ level students and the teachers for producing good results.",Child president scores 10 As at O’ level,www.sundaynews.co.zw
